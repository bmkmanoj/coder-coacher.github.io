this series on creating a shopping cart
with no GS and Express so I left at this
state here where we had data in our
database ceded to the database and
displayed those these data on well on
our starting page here that's nice but
sooner or later we're going to need a
user and I want to start implementing
this user design up functional he design
in functionality and so on right now so
let's start with that I'll head over to
my project and the first important thing
I'll do is I'll create a new folder in
the views folder which I'll call user
and Whitchurch of course keep all my
user related views this will be my sign
up view so sign up dot HBS my sign in
view and my editor is hanging so now I'm
allowed to continue and my profile view
so this would be my free user views and
I'll start in these sign up view where I
will create a new row bootstrap here of
course then add some styling so some
columns here just to give this a nice
positioning and look then yes this
wheedies signup page and then I will
create a form I'll take care about the
action later for now I will set the
method to post though and in this form I
want to the form group where I have a
label for my email field so I'm going to
identify users with email and password
by the way if you haven't guessed by
that so this will be what my user model
looks like right now of course later
this will be extended with address and
so on if we really go into the shopping
theme more but this basic login will
have email and password so ID email and
whoops and name email and
this oops this also needs a class here
form control I oftentimes forget that
not this time though so then here I'm
going to select all that replace it with
password type should be password of
course and the label will be password
too and then I'll add button of type
submit' which should say sign up so
that's my basic form here later I want
to add some validation errors here so
I'll create a placeholder for that right
now and also all I need to take care
about CSRF protection so the protection
that my session gets stolen so to say
and I will set up this protection a
second to the first thing I wanted you
though is to create my user model before
I come to the other topics here so I'll
go to my models file folder here and
create a new file user J s now any year
I'll of course import Mongoose so
require Mongoose and create a schema so
mongoose schema and then i will define
my my model here so it a user schema
first which will of course be a new
schema to which I passed the definition
as a JavaScript object like we did it
for the product model my user will have
an email which should be of type string
and which will be required and my user
should also have or you have a password
of type string which should also be
required so that's nice I can then
export all of that module exports
mongoose model user user schema very
nice indeed
but this is not complete yet I want to
add some methods to my user schema and
therefore to the user model which allow
me to hash my password when I'm storing
it so just a convenience method that I
can easily make sure that the password
is hashed and I want to add a method to
validate this hashed password and I will
need all of that later when I'm actually
coming to signing in the user or
generally to my user sign up and sign-in
process which will need or use these
methods because in node express here I
will use a third party package passport
like you often do in node express apps
where you use a lot of packages to
handle all my user creation users sign
in because writing that all on your own
is of course possible but really complex
and there is no need to do so since
password the package I will be using is
a great package handling all of that and
whilst being great it's still very
flexible so just wanted to say that
right away however before I come to that
I want to go back to this CSRF
protection thing which you might know
from my lateral videos if you watch them
to CSRF protection is very important to
make sure that our session can't get
stolen or that if it gets stolen our
users still aren't able to create users
with our session or use our assigned in
session and so on therefore in for
example arival i add a hidden input
field here in my form which would also
get submitted which sends the session
token which allows the server to
identify if the browser sending this
token is the same browser well which got
the session in the first place which of
course protects us against a session
getting stolen
note doesn't offer this functionality
out of the box as you are probably aware
note in general is a very core compact
key functionality and the same is true
for the Express framework and then you
add packages for all the different
things or functionalities you want to
add
so for CSRF protection we have such a
package available you can find this
package by searching for sea surf and
then this github account here this is
the get up repository for the package
we're going to use and here you also
find the installation command so I'm
going to install this in my project
create a new terminal window for that
copy that into here and I'll add the
save flag to also create an entry D
package.json file and as we'll install
this CSRF protection package however
installing it is not enough I also have
to make sure do some extra steps in my
index chairs file in the routes folder I
will import this or assign it to a
variable variable known and named CSRF
require C surf then I will create a
variable name CSRF protection which will
use this c CSRF package with that i'm
starting the CSRF protection service
error I'm able to use it as a middleware
and next here I will use it when I
create my additional routes so let's do
this I will create the route for the
signup page this will be a get route
signup and I want to use user slash
signup function request response and
next and for now here I will return user
slash signup view so this signup dot h
PS file in the user folder and I will
pass something to that view I will pass
this CSRF token this package we just
added will create for us so CSRF token
should be request and then we can access
your I've token on that request so the
CSRF package is providing us with this
functionality to pass this token to our
review so if we now have a look at this
and if I go to the sign-up tour HPS file
I will output this token so that we can
see that this works and just as a normal
text here is of course it's not how the
protection will work this just to see
that it is working however this code
won't work since I'm using the default
configuration for the Caesar F package
which requires sessions to be enabled
now sessions have to be imported by a
separate package to this project so I
will do this next I will run npm install
- - save express - session and then the
app.js file I will import this session
from reap or why I require express
session and I will need to set us up
here when I set up all members aware for
example after you setting up the cookie
parser by using app use and then session
and then this will basically enable
sessions and I will add some
configuration here for example I will
provide a secret my super secret and you
may of course pick a more a better key
to save your sessions and then I will
also specify two additional options
which you should specify when using this
package the resave option which i will
set to false the default is true but the
default is deprecated now this basically
means that if this is set drew this
session will be saved on a server on
each request no matter if something
changed or not and I'm setting this to
false that I'm not doing this all the
time and the other option you should
specify it
is also safe initialized also set to
Falls here too
the default is true and is deprecated
too this means that if this is set to
true the session will be stored or in a
server even though it might not have
been initialized that nothing has been
added there and we don't want that
behavior so if data session is set up
and now back in the index dot JS file I
also have to apply the spell aware to
this router so to protect my routes here
I do this by running or by using the use
method on this router and then using
this CSRF protection I set up here so
with that I'm now telling Express all
the routes include it in this router
package here
should be protected by CSRF protection
so now if i restart my server and i had
two application and go to user signup
you now see this key I was specifying
your justice token this CSRF token you
also see an ugly button so I'm going to
fix both get rid of this token here and
also give this button some classes to
give it a nicer styling and with that I
can then add a hidden input field here
which should have a name of underscore
CSRF by this name de package will try to
identify it and find this token and then
the value using handlebars here should
be this CSRF token i just print it to
the screen so with that this token is
also submitted whenever we submit this
form and then this package is able to
check well if this token is there so if
this is submitted
right so I'm going to add an action here
which lead to user signup
and I want to create this route here
router post user signup function request
response and next and I'll take care
about the actual user creation a second
for now I want to see if this protection
works so all we'll do here is I will for
now redirect the user to the starting
page here so I'll restart my server
reload this page here and draw something
here doesn't really matter
and I'm redirected now if I go to my
signup page and I comment out this
hidden input field and if I now go to
the user signup page again I get an
error that I got an invalid CSRF token
so this protection is in place and is
working just what I wanted
so with that this very important piece
is set up and in the next lecture I will
go into how we actually create a new
user
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
