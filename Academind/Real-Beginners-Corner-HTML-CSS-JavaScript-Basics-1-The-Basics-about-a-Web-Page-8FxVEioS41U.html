brand new series web development for
real beginners in this course I promise
we're gonna start at zero we will look
at what is a web page which components
make a web page up and then we will go
step by step through these components to
really get you going with web
development now I'm not telling you that
after this video series you'll be able
to create super awesome complex websites
but I will promise you that you will
have everything you need to really get
started with web development so let's
dive into it so I'm here on the
Microsoft u.s. page and this is no
coincidence
I'm here because this page is really
good for talking about what a web page
really is and which components make it
up without any basics your on your web
page like those you think more will end
looking pretty okay right so we got our
menu bar here then we got this big main
slider here or image gallery where we
can cycle through but in this case two
of their main products we get a little
more products here and so on we
consequence scroll down we got these
effects like this image here which will
change every few seconds so this webpage
really has some components you see on
modern websites these days so what
actually is a web page now web page is
simply what our browser displays when he
gets data from a server so when we enter
microsoft.com here in the you are the UT
URL up here in our browser URL bar what
our browser will do is send a request to
the Microsoft servers saying hey I got a
wizard ur wants to see your web page
please give me all
information I need to show it to it now
the Microsoft server might do some
stephane in the background but in the
end it will send us back some HTML which
the browser then can then render for us
to display now this is HTML part is
really important because HTML in the end
is what every web page you see is
obviously on the server that might be
running different programming languages
and a very complex complex business
logic but what you see in your browser
will always be HTML rendered to you
because browser developers as well as
web developers need some standards for
which they can develop so that they know
ok we get this pool off in this case
HTML tags as we will see soon from which
we can take some to create our website
and this will make sure that the website
will look the same in each browser on
each device now that is a bit of a
simplification there are small
differences unfortunately but in
generally that's the logic now if you
want to see that HTML code I can just
right click with most browsers and then
we will have some point which says view
source here or a source code here so I'm
using a German browser that's why it's
in German but in general this would be
an English view the source code and with
a click it well we see the source code
of this web page and this what we see
here is exactly what our browser gets as
a response upon its request it's sent to
the server now as you can see that's a
bit hard to read although it's at least
a little bit indented but not the way
you want to look at a web page probably
and that is cool because that's
chav of the browser it is taking all of
this code and rendering into this
nice-looking few here now I'll be honest
with you pure HTML wouldn't create a
page like this pure HTML is all you need
to be able to render a web page to the
user but it will look pretty ugly
because pure HTML only get some basic
styling a very very generic styling and
it will not look nice and we will see
this in the next video where we go into
HTML a bit more so what we get from the
browser is not only the HTML here but we
also got some styling rules and this is
this can always be found at the top of
our HTML document we get back from the
browser so here we will have a style
section let me just look for it style
link here get these link tags which are
which have a relationship style sheet
sheet and are of type text/css now CSS
stands for cascading style sheets and it
is the styling language of the web if
you want to put it that way
now there are several ways to tell the
browser how to style element and one
would be to write it directly into the
element tag one would be to put a
styling section at the beginning of an
HTML document where you define some
rules but the most commonly used is to
out source it into separate styling
sheets such called CSS files like this
one shell Buckman dot CSS now this file
lies in some other server or on the same
server
as possible and here in the HTML
document we're basically telling the
browser okay there is some styling which
has to be applied to this page and the
rules can be found in this document now
you can absolutely specify separate
documents and what the browser will do
is load them all up in the order you
specified here and this is important
because cascading style sheets do
cascade so they overwrite each other by
order styles are created or entered into
the document and we will go into detail
much more about CSS and then next we use
but just so you know ordering is very
important in CSS as well as cascading in
general but we will get back to that so
we got our links here which load some
style sheets here's another one link
also referring to the sky science sheet
and these style sheets here is one
loaded up then define a bunch of rules
on sizing of our font open the colors to
spacing the way the items are aligned
and if they sit next to each other and
so on and so on now as you can see this
is not very readable readable here and
that's because it is minified that means
for the developer certainly hasn't
written it this way the developer has
written it nicely spaced out and colored
and you don't code like this right but
in the end you got your build process
where we will make sure that once you're
done everything is crunched up as much
as you can and this has one single
reason a file like this only contains
text but even this text will
up file size wise if you get a lot of
indentation blank spaces and the one
which you will absolutely have in your
development environment but you don't
want it in your production environment
because the browser has to download all
these files because it's specified here
in the beginning and obviously it will
need these files otherwise wouldn't be
able to interpret your webpage styling
and if you get a bunch of big size files
for a browser to download on every page
of lessons with it this can really add
up to your page loading speed and you
don't want that okay so that's the
second building block besides HTML
cascading sky style sheets so you can
memorize this at this point HTML will
lay out the structure of our web page
and CSS will apply some style to it so
it looks nice now the last building
block is something like these pictures
here which change automatically that is
achieved via JavaScript see you got this
like Holy Trinity of front-end web
development and they're just talking
about front and what development here at
the moment because we're talking about
what the user sees which is front it the
Holy Trinity I won't is called a vessel
this way is HTML for structure CSS for
styling and JavaScript for all the
effects and good user experience really
because the HTML document by itself as
well as the styling is static once it is
loaded it doesn't change by itself so if
we wanted to change like exchanging this
picture here opening some pop-up windows
if user click somewhere dynamically
reloading data we would have to employ
via JavaScript which is a programming
language which will run directly in the
browser it is not precompiled it is
interpreted by the browser on the run
and then it will do all kinds of stuff
so this is the program programming
language we can use to run it on the
client the user computer and which then
can really enhance the user experience
so if we were back to this HTML source
code here let me just search for script
which are these script tags here and
there we have two options of including
scripts again one is to just open a
script tag and write our script between
the script tags this is the case here we
got our opening script tag here and we
got a real closing script tag here and
between we get some JavaScript ok you do
this for for some scripts you want to
have new pages but here as it was the
case of CSS the more common cases to
include an external script file so this
is here Decatur's the case here we
gather a script type of text javascript
and between our script tags here we
don't have anything but we're including
this source here and this is linking to
a script on another server in this case
it's a query which we will talk about
too because jQuery is a very neat little
JavaScript library which is of use to
webpages which really chest makes some
operations easier and very yeah handy to
to do so that is our javascript file
which will ask the CSS file was be
loaded when this page is requested and
server sends back to
HTML or this this document here then the
browser will read through it from top to
bottom and execute every line and this
includes downloading styling and
scripting files as well as rendering
this and that's by the way where it's
important to have our styling sheets at
the beginning of this document because
the browser will then first load our
styling sheets and then it will go
through the HTML structure and apply the
styling is defined in the sheets and if
you were to include our styling sheets
at the bottom of this page well then our
browser will just render everything very
ugly and in the end I would get the
rules but that's when everything is over
handed word nap white so therefore
styling has always be loaded at the
beginning of this document whereas
strips can reload it in the beginning
and the hats tag I will go back and come
back to this later two of our document
where we define some metadata for it it
can also be loaded in the body tag which
is beginning here which holds the
content of our document and it can also
be loaded at the end of our body tag
which is a very common place for most
scripts because think of scripts in this
way they enhance user action so when do
they need to be available once the page
has loaded obviously because the user is
not interacting with the page in any way
until it is finished loading that's why
we include scripts at the bottom of the
page most of the time because that does
suffice it's it's okay if where they are
loaded last because the user is only
going to interact with them once
everything is loaded and then you might
say okay but it doesn't matter if I load
them first or last right it does matter
because script files can be very large
they are only text but they couldn't
connect
in a lot of text and we can load a lot
of scripts of files and now if this is
the case and we were to load them at the
top of our page then the browser would
see okay I have to load the script it
would start loading it and it would only
continue once it is loaded because as I
said it goes through this document line
by line and it only continues with the
next line when the line before is done
so it's better to including at the
bottom so it can render out all the page
and then load the script tags so the
user sees a paste
page even though it might not be fully
loaded there might be some scripts
missing but it already asked the page
the user already has the page to look at
and it doesn't look like the page takes
forever to load now if the user wants to
interact with the page in the some
script is necessary for this and the
script is not loaded yet then obviously
this interaction will fail but this is a
very rare case we're talking about
milliseconds and seconds of loading time
but it's still better to load document
first and the scripts last so that we
get to view something on our screen as
soon as possible
now that's a lot of talking about this
HTML thing and just CSS and JavaScript
thing but it's important for you to get
the components of a web page
and how to play together now now that
you get this wrap overview in the next
videos we are going to dive deeper into
these components we're talking about
HTML we'll be talking about CSS and the
end we will also be talking a little bit
about JavaScript so I see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
