currently we're of course hard coding
this I will have to loop through them
however I can't loop through all the
products since I need to chant them
because I have several rows here I don't
have all the thumbnails in in one boot
stripper oh I got multiple rows because
I want to have three items by default if
it's not collapsing on a smaller screen
I want to have three items in one row
therefore I need a way to loop through
chunks of these items to actually well
we'll be able to output what I want to
output here thankfully level makes this
real easy the first step is to start at
the place where we load this view so in
the routes file I will no longer just
return view here I will add a controller
to this whole application so I will
create a new controller file here can't
get rid of this off folder by the way
and now we'll use a different approach
than other than my past videos I already
showed how you would create a PHP file
and basically set up like this file here
another way is to use the artist in
command line tool to run PHP artisan
make controller and you are supplying a
name sounds right so this will be the
product controller if I now have a look
at my controllers file I got this
product controller here and this is just
a quick way to create an empty
controller with the important import
select each request object which you'll
often need already in place so in here I
will create a new controller action a
method in this controller which I will
call get index and then this function I
want to return the view the same method
I was using here in the routes file and
this will use this controller or allows
me to use this controller to actually
use it I will go back to the routes file
and replace this closure here with an
array to configure this route or to
configure it Rick what request should do
or what should happen
request reaching this route so I want to
use a controller here the product
controller of course and here d get
products get index excuse me get index
action I will also give this route a
name we'll call it product index and
with that all requests reaching that
route will be redirected to this
controller action here now in this
action I not only want to return view
though this would work you can see it if
I reload I want to return the different
products so I will do this by creating a
new variable called products and then I
will use the product model also imported
here use app product this is the model
we created in the last with you I will
use this model and then the all method
to simply fetch all the products next I
add an array to this view method here as
a second argument to return all only the
view but also attach some data to this
response or not to this response but to
this arm math call here where this view
is rendered bilaterals plate templating
engine I want to pass a variable named
products and this name is up to you here
this will create a variable available in
the view PHP file and I will set as
equal to the products variable up here
so this part a stringer will create
level will create a new variable called
products which we can then use with
dollar assign products in this view file
in this plate or PHP file so to use it I
want to look through all the products
but as I said I kind of have to create
some chunks to make sure that actually I
have an outer loop with all the chunks
so for example if I have five products
like it is the case here and I only want
to display free per line I would have
two chunks the first chunk holding free
products and the second chunk holding
the remain
two products so in order to do this I
will create a new 4-h loop and I will
loop through products as I said this is
possible because this dollar sign
products refers to the variable I create
here or I tell Larry Bell to create for
each products as product now almost as
product chunk would be a more fitting
name because I want to loop four chunks
however this will loop through
individual elements thankfully level
offers a useful helper method here which
you can use on any collection and this
is a collection data you get from
database through eloquent levels over M
will be a collection unless you got it
wire the first method which will return
a single item so this collection here
has this chunk method which you can use
and then I define chunk size free I want
free items in each chunk and now this
will no longer provide the individual
items inside this loop but instead
chunks of items so I will end this for
each loop here and inside this loop I
will copy one row when bootstrap row
here get rid of all the amur HTML code
below here and also get rid of two
columns I only need one so now I will
create this whole content here per chunk
however I only want to create the rows
per chunk because the column should be
on a per product basis so inside of this
row I will create a number for each loop
where a loop Rudi's chunk items as
products air because the items in this
product chunk of course are the
individual products just split up over
multiple arrays chunks now I can all do
and it should access this loop and
inside of this loop I'll have my column
now that this words can be
scene because if I reload we get five
items now so we're not seeing the data
we see that because I didn't insert this
yet but by the fact that we got five
nicely aligned items we can see that
this chunking process here works now to
output the actual data I'll start with
the image I use double curly braces to
enter the level expression here and then
I will simply use my product and output
the image path because image path is D
as one of the fields I set up and as my
creation file image path here and we can
use these database fields like
properties on the data we get back from
the database on level since we use again
level eloquent which allows us this
mapping from model with which we work in
our application and database entry which
we have in the backend or in our
database so I can use this now we'll
just copy that and do the same for the
title and for the description here and
of course for the price now I will leave
the dollar sign because I don't have
that included in my price I just have a
number and with this if I now reload you
can see that we get a different pictures
and titles short descriptions and texts
now the thumbnails don't have equal
sizes but that's okay for me and yeah we
did a lot here we are seeing the data we
have in the database we're actually
creating this data we set up the
database tables and now we're outputting
it here I'll be happy to greet you back
in the next videos when we take the next
steps
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
