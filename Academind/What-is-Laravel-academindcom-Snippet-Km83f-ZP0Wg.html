our traditional setup with the client so
the browser and the server which
exchange requests and responses then
Lera will runs on the server it's not a
server-side language though it's instead
a server-side framework for PHP which is
the server-side language right at your
app with just PHP is pretty cumbersome
and you can easily make some mistakes
and that is why you typically use
frameworks like letter well to make it
easier to get a lot of helper tools and
lateral tends to be or happens to be one
of the most popular ones you use it to
work with files to easily access the
database and a general to run your
server-side business logic so any logic
that you don't want or can't execute in
the browser letter will therefore kind
of competes with Ruby on Rails asp.net
nodejs and Java though I also listed
frameworks like Express or spring
because keep in mind Larry will is a
framework it's not the language the
languages PHP just makes using that
language easier level is framework not a
language you heard this and to be more
specific it offers us a lot of packages
around routing so handling requests to
different urls correctly about managing
the database access security related
packages it makes working with files and
storage easier it helps us to handle
requests and responses and send to write
HTML files back to the client for
example
it helps us with caching if we want this
and much much more
level is an awesome framework and you
might want to use it because PHP still
is one of the most widely used
server-side languages it's Meryl of PHP
it's simple it's fast its scalable it
gets used by bigger companies and it has
a widened ecosystem and community there
are loads of resources that help you
diving into Larry well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
