this by creating a new routes file here
which only named user J s and I will
take all my users related routes here so
old in new routes I entered and get them
into this file of course that will also
copy the code at the top here because I
will need the Express router and so on
passport CSRF I will get rid of passport
in the index.js file then I'll copy
these CSRF protection over to my user
file here you can get rid of it here in
the index file then now I will get rid
of all the user prefixes
and I will of course export this router
so I'm copying this code here Q at the
bottom and then in the app chess file
what I'll do is I'll add a new import
here routes I'll name it user routes
require routes user and down here I'll
check if the prefix is slash user in
this case I will redirect to use routes
any other path not beginning with slash
user will still be sent to the index
chess while therefore the ordering here
is important because if I would have
this middleware first all my requests
would be sent to index chess file and
would not reach the user chess file so I
want this order here so now that's
grouping by the prefix if I restart my
server we should still have a working
route here and I should still be able to
get to the index page cool and the next
thing is I want to protect some routes
so that I can only access them if I am
logged in to do this I will go to my
user chess file in the routes folder and
I will add a new function at the bottom
of this file D is locked in function
which takes a request the response and
its next object so this will be a middle
of where my own milla where I write and
I will check if request is authenticated
resolves to true
this is authenticated as a method added
by passport and passport manages the
authentication state in the session
automatically so when I successfully
login it will set it to true and so on
so with this I can then return next
which means continue and otherwise I
will say redirect to let's say the
starting page now I can use this medal
where for all the routes I want to
protect for example or the only route
currently I want to protect is the
profile route so I will add is locked in
here and I'll just reorder this to have
sign up and sign in at the top
that's really
matter here but with that I'm making
sure and I have to use the parentheses
here though should only be a reference
to the function I don't want to execute
it so with data making sure that I check
if the user is logged in before allowing
them to access the login page now in
order to demonstrate this I'll also add
to logout functionality so that we can
switch between both states I'll add this
new route here router yet slash log out
and this will be my normal middleware my
normal function here and in here what I
will do is I will call request log out
all the method added by password of
course and then I will redirect to the
front page let's say and with this I'm
able to well log out so if I restart
this let's see this in action
I will go to user slash profile and I'm
redirected to the start page because I'm
not locked in if I do a log in is wrong
go to sign-in and I do sign-in I am able
to access user profile so this is
working now I also want to implement the
opposite case so a middle word that
makes sure that only unauthenticated
users are able to reach certain routes
so I will name this not locked in and
basically reverse the logic check if I'm
not authenticated and I will add not
locked in to the other routes where I
want to make sure that the user is not
locked in now I can make this very easy
by simply adding router reuse which will
oppose to get and post target all
requests no matter what the word is so
all requests and I also don't care about
the path should be checked with this not
locked in and then request response next
I will execute next here
and I will place this in front of all
the routes where I want to check if they
are not locked in therefore the routes
where I do want to make sure the user is
locked in
basically the profile route has to come
in front of this one so let's see if
this works the way it should work all
going to end the server and restart it
go to profile I'm redirected back user
sign-in still works if I log in I get to
use a profile and if I try to access
users sign in I redirected back to the
starting page so this now works too and
I have to middlewares in place and I'm
kind of grouping Bimal aware by having
this filter in front of all the other
routes which I want to check for the
user not being logged in so a lot has
been achieved the user is able to sign
up to sign in we're protecting routes
and we are able to log out what still is
not that nice is that this drop down
here is totally irrelevant the links
don't work and they don't adjust to
dickered login state so let's do
something about that in order to do
something about that I will go back to
my application and in the app chess foul
right before I well sent a request to
any routes I'll add a new middleware so
this will be a middleware executed on
all requests and what I do here is I'll
execute a function request response next
so this default Express middleware set
up and I want you to set a global
property or variable which I will have
available in my views I can do this
using the locals object on my response
and then I will name it login so this
login name is totally up to you then
we'll set this equal to request is
authenticated so this will basically be
true or false and with that I have to
slog invariable available in all my
views and I want this behavior because
that is something
need to have available in all my views
and then I execute next to let the
requests continue so I'm basically
setting this global variable here and
then in my view in the header
I want you style the navigation bar
appropriately or especially this user
drop-down this this user management here
user management here at this so
basically what I want here is inside
this unordered list I'll add a
handlebars if statement and I will check
if login this is the global variable I
just setup which is true or false if it
is true then I want you so if the user
is logged in then I want to show the
user account or the logout button if it
is false so I'll add an else case here
then I will show sign up or sign in and
I'll get rid of the separator and the
logout link this if I restart the server
and go to my application and I click
here
you now see sign up or sign in so let's
go to sign up oh that works that doesn't
work so in order to make this work I
should probably add some links here so
the user account is user profile the log
out page is user log out sign up is user
sign up and sign in is of course user
sign in so with this next try if I
reload go to sign up this now works and
I'll enter a new email address which
shouldn't be in the pair in the database
so I'm redirected to user profile and
you see this updated I can go to the
user profile I can go back to you home
page if I adjust this and give this
brand a link of just slash so let's try
this again home page profile log out
reader
rekted and I still see the user account
I still can't go there so the logout is
not working what's wrong here user log
out I have made a mistake here this log
out route should of course not be
available to locked-in users but the
opposite is the case it should only be
available if you are locked in and of
course you could group this again here
with a middleware like this one here but
I'll keep it like that so if I now
restart the server and I reload this
page and I try this again sign in sign
in log out yeah this looks much better
so now the header is updated this error
has been fixed and we kind of working
signup and sign-in process going on we
got validation place and I think this
our well very important first steps in
order to continue with this application
see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
