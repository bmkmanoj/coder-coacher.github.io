video I want to have a look at how we
can use events in our view chase
application I prepared this application
you might recognize it from one of my
other videos and here all ideas output
this title data property here now I want
to change this I want to actually enable
the user to do something in our
application to dynamically update the
title hence updating this Dom or the
page we see here because you chase of
course is also very capable of listening
to user events so let's work on that so
we get the title here now let's say we
want to change this title whenever I
click a button so let's add a button
first this button here well let's give
it a text of change title and then we
want to change the title to a fixed new
value now of course you could also add
an input field and listen to let's say
the keydown keyup or input event the
approach will be the same but let's
first start it how can we listen to an
event this is a button and with
traditional JavaScript we could add the
on click listener or something like that
but with view chairs it works a bit
different instead of listening to on
click or something like that
we need a directive a directive is a
instruction we place in our template and
the part of the Dom we control for
instance here and view choice will
recognize this instruction just
directive and know what to do with it
now the directive we need here is a
built-in one one with which view chairs
ships which is called V on the we - at
the beginning basically tells you J as
oh I should take care about this it
doesn't seem to be a normal HTML
attribute and on then is the name of the
directive now on is a built-in directive
which basically is used for listening to
events to this directive we need to pass
an argument which we do by adding a
colon and this argument now is the name
of the UN to which you want to listen
now the name
or the event to which I want to listen
is called click because I want to react
to whenever I click this button
therefore here we now add equal sign and
then to quotation marks to now specify
which code to execute whenever this
event which we're listening here occur
is now we can execute some code in there
like let's say title equals and then
with single quotation marks new title to
change it if we now add control enter we
see this button and if I hit this button
we see that title was updated to new
title this is the reactivity view Chaz's
great ad we change title in one place of
our application and that of course
changed it in this data object and that
lat view chairs to automatically updated
in our displayed page so in our Dom
because we're outputting it here wire
string interpolation this is how we can
listen to events and this is how view
chess then well knows what to update in
the Dom now an alternative to setting
the title here between the quotation
marks would be to execute a method so
let's execute the change title method
and in order to have this method we need
to add a new property to the view
instance this is the methods object so
where data is also reserved word so is
methods and method simply stores all the
methods this view jeaious instance knows
so all the methods you want to trigger
from within our template up here they
have to be stored in this methods object
therefore here what we want to do is set
up the change title method in here and
now you may use es6 syntax so you can
write this method like this and as a
side note if es6 or javascript is
something you don't feel 100%
comfortable well you might want to dive
a little bit deeper into it and you will
find some useful links to both videos as
well as possible coaching you could book
not by me though but from a different
page in the description of the video but
back to our code here we
have our title or our change title
method and in there I now want to simply
execute the same code I ran before the
one a targets title though that will not
work because title here would look for a
title variable in this method instead I
have to say this title and now this
would look strange to I'd imagine
because we would imagine that this
refers to the methods object well turns
out behind the scenes vue.js does some
magic there and whenever you reference
something with this inside of the view
instance as we do here it will
automatically refer to the view instance
as a whole and all the data properties
all your methods and so on are
automatically proxied by view chairs on
this instance top-level so this now
refers to our whole instance object here
and it turns out that view chest kind of
gives us access to all our data
properties and all our methods on this
overall top-level object some magic done
behind the scenes so here I can then
also say change title so if we see a
difference and if we now hit control
enter again and click on change title we
see change title here now executed
through a method to which we point here
in our click listener</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
