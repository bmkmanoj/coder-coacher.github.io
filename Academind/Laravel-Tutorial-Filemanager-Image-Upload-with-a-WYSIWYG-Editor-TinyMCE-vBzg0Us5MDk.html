when we had our editor set up and we
could well use it we could write a bold
create lists and so on but one very
interesting part is missing the image
upload now this is something which is a
very complex and I'll be honest we won't
write all the logic the back and logic
here on our own though I will truly out
that I will make some videos about file
management creating your own file
manager in the future but right now what
I will use is this lateral file manager
of a uni sharp and you will find a link
skit have repository in the description
which is a great file manager and best
thing is it is well kind of configured
to work great with tiny MCE and ckeditor
and it is really easy to set up and to
get going and yet as you can already see
in the screenshot here it not only
allows allows you to pick up file
uploaded it allows you to manage all the
files on your lateral application or in
your lateral application on your disks
you have there so really great thing and
as I said might definitely be
interesting to create something like
this in future videos but as this is a
very complex project I really only want
to focus on getting this going in tiny
MCE so that you can get started right
away because that really is an important
part of programming to knowing how to
use for party packages and saving time
by using them there is nothing bad about
that so first thing us we need to
install it and we can follow the
installation document here it's really
easy first thing is I'll well I will
just basically copy all these lines here
I'll go to my command line here and I
will require it via composer
this will take a couple of seconds and
we'll then add it to our approach
and install it I'll be back once it's
done cool so my installation just
finished and now this was the first step
the next step as described here is to
take these service providers here and
add them in our application in the
config directory the app dot PHP file
here at the bottom this will actually
register them in our egg look in our
angular in our level application without
these lines here yes we have installed
it but level would not use it and would
not know how to use it because this kind
of is the interface written by the
creators of the third-party packaging
you need to do this for every third
party package you might produce to tell
their world how to use it how to use
this package so this is these are the
service providers next thing is fs8 here
I'm going to import and then I will need
to run these two commands here to
actually publish the own configuration
file this word party package ships with
and if we know how to look in our a
config folder we see this new file this
l of m dot PHP this was just added by
this published command which allows for
party packages to copy files into your
main application because you might need
to access them there and we do need to
access this configuration file which
configures our file manager the first
thing I'll do is I will disable the
renaming of files because this word
we're use ready and I won't don't want
to restrict us to only locked in users
now this is all fine here but here we
need to change off to web because well
of indications not only something we
want to enforce but the web malware is
important for this to work correctly I
also want a line below
to user access here and well the rest
ship you find as it shifts with and as
you can see you can configure which
types of files you want to be able to
handle and you can see tells us much
more than just some images here where to
store them on your your application also
we're important and yeah and so on so
just a basic configuration this is how
we need to have it set up and now coming
back to this welcome to plated PHP file
here I said that this part here is
related to the file manager and it is
and what does it do well it basically
defines the dimensions of our window
here and then just defines basically
which which layout to load or yeah how
to load this file manager so this is
important for this recording package
however file browser callback is a
configuration provided by tiny MCE and
if we were to write our own file browser
we needed to implement this function and
tell tiny MCE what you do whenever the
user clicks this file manager button
which basically is the button next to
the I want to upload an image thing so
this is very important and this is the
configuration as we need it for it as
file into reusing here the lateral
vitamin planet shirt we're correcting it
only works for this file manager that's
very important
this has to be hand tailored to
whichever file mentor you use and you
can see the setup here in the
integration part where basically it is
described how you can integrate it with
tiny FC and this is pretty much the same
code you'll see here I just copied it
from there and it also describes how to
use it with ckeditor or independent of
any well what you see is what you get
and for because the end it's a file
entry you might use it in whichever way
you want it doesn't have to be limited
to a rich editor you
just have normal button which you should
trigger file upload so this is how you
use it and here is more information
about how to configure it and lastly how
to customize it of course now with all
this is there anything else we have to
do no let's reload and now let's click
this insert edit image button here now
here we could enter semi URL but you can
also click this file enter button I was
talking about which will trigger this
file browser callback function here and
which will open up our file mature as
you can see I already uploaded one file
but I will upload a new one here let's
click this button and let's say well
I'll just upload this image here so now
I got my images here and I can easy even
resize and drop them and you can see my
awesome Amazon purchases here and yeah
so really a great functionality this
editor has built-in this is the reason
why we are using it this would be a
whole lot of work to create your own and
as you can see you can really do a lot
here you can create new folders and so
on so it is a fully fledged file lantern
not limited to image upload but of
course does or it is and it does offer
resizing and cropping and so on now back
into this folder I can then select this
image here ok now you can see is edited
here I can click Submit and I got it on
the next page - obviously not style this
will have to be done by you but this is
how it works and how you can integrate
tiny MCE and a file manager to manage
what files and uploads in your level
application lastly let's have a look
where these files are saved at and as
you can see I got this photos folder
here ways where it to say
well this is done in this place because
in my configuration file for a file
enter I specified the public folders
should be the place where images are
saved and of course I could use our
places yourtube now I hope this helps
you and yeah I hope this helps you get
going with your applications that
integrate such a editors there see you
in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
