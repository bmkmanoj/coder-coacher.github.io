name is Maximilian and in a previous
video I already got you started with AWS
in this video I want to show you how you
can deploy a level application including
a database cue AWS using AWS elastic
beanstalk let's start
this is the application I want to deploy
a very simple one but it does use a
database behind the scenes in this
application we can sign up
and create blog posts like this is my
first post the very first one when we
did this we see an overview over all
blog posts I already created some and
that is the application not super
amazing but using a database which makes
it interesting when we talk about
deployment now you can find this
application on get up a link can be
found in the video description and there
you can simply clone or download this
repository now I'll do this too so I
will download it
and I'll work with this one now as I
said I want to use elastic beanstalk to
deploy this application why if we switch
to AWS in the end what we'll need is a
server and we can spin up a virtual
machine instance using their ec2 service
this allows us to spin up virtual
servers so basically like physical ones
which we own but just a part on a
physical server with the configuration
we want we could do this and then we
could install a web server on ec2 and
deploy our code onto the instance we
will also have to take care that we set
it up in a secure way and do some
configuration and we could do all that
but there is an easier way if our goal
is to deploy a web application and that
easier way is an average service named
elastic Beanstalk behind-the-scenes
elastic Beanstalk will use easy to it
will start such a server for us but it
was you also all the other configuration
we want to do and it makes it easy for
us to ship our code onto the instance to
manage different versions different
environments like a testing or
production environment and all these
things well let's let's get started with
elastic Beanstalk for that click simple
you on get started and give your
application a name I'll name it lateral
simple block next you need to choose a
platform and since we're using letter
low this obviously should be PHP since
levels and PHP framework we don't want
to start the sample application instead
we want to upload our own code and now
it would be tempting to pick the zip
file you downloaded from github right
that won't work though the zip file
which you upload here should contain all
the source files and not a folder which
contains all the source files therefore
simply go to the folder you just
download it and extract it this will
give you a folder and now in this folder
select all the files and compress them
zip them again with your favorite
zipping tool however before you do so
make sure you do one thing you will see
that dot Ian Vito
sample file level managers a couple of
global settings in its dot E&amp;amp;V file and
by default this dot env fault is not
shared when hosting or when shipping
your code through a code repository like
github which is why here you only have a
dummy file and not an actual one you
should copy that file and rename it to
dot Ian we without dot example and now
let's open that follows your favorite
text editor I'm using sublime here and
now you can edit it and one thing we do
have to edit as we have to assign an app
key here all the other settings can stay
as they are for now I'll change this
from local to brought though but this is
up to you you can set any value here the
URL can also stay as it is for now so we
need that API key here the app key to be
precise and to get one we can use the
artisan command to generate one however
for that we will need PHP installed in
our machine so make sure that you have
PHP installed you can then simply
navigate into your folder and run PHP
artisan and then a command but for this
to work we actually need to do one our
thing first we need to install all the
dependencies if we have a look at our
folder we see that it got no Wender
folder here so all the dependencies
including the lateral framework itself
are missing that is normal you always
distribute your code or ship it to get
up with our dependencies like these
since you can easily install them using
composer in this case make sure you have
composer installed on your machine link
can be found in the video description
and then in this project folder you
downloaded and extracted you can run
composer install and this will now
install all the dependencies this
project needs including level that will
take a couple of seconds once it is done
we can use the artisan command to
generate a key
so it did finish for me now you can run
a new command still in that folder PHP
artisan key : generate and this will
generate this application key and
automatically store it in this dot e + V
file as you can see if you open it again
here it is whether the project is
prepared and now we can select all these
files inside this folder so only the
files in this folder and compress them
this will generate a new zip file on
windows of course use a program like sip
or WinZip or WinRAR and whip that
compressed you may take your compressed
file rename it to whatever you like
I'll name it Larry Wilson blog v1 and go
cue elastic Beanstalk with it because
here we need to upload our code and now
we get a zip file with the code so let's
choose the code here choose that zip
file we just created which holds all our
code including the dependencies
including the vendor folder and let's
click upload now as you can see in the
bottom left is now ships our code to
Amazon then elastic Beanstalk will spin
up the ec2 instance we need and we'll
ship our code onto the instance and also
configure that instance to hold a
webserver and so on before it does
although we need to go through the
remaining steps of the configuration we
could click create application or we
have a view look at the other options we
can set up here we can for example
choose which kind of fries that we want
to use
I'll go up the low-cost one which stays
within this free tier as long as you
don't have multiple of these apps but of
course you could choose to a more
production-ready one and you can change
the environment settings I'll name the
environment here differently I'll name
it prod you can choose any name you like
and you can manage different environment
on the elastic Beanstalk for example for
a testing environment a protection
environment a staging environment new
feature environment whatever you need
now with this all set up the default
settings should be fine and we can click
on create app now this will
as such assets been up that ec2 instance
ship or occurred onto it set everything
up there and I'll be back once that's
finished the environment successfully
launched for me and with that we get a
link where you can visit our application
so let's click it and there we see
forbidden now do you have an idea where
this error might come from it's tricky
to spot but do you have an idea well you
find out where this error comes from
let's have a look at our level
application structure this is the folder
we uploaded and there as you probably
are aware if you know a level the main
entry point where the request is handled
first is inside the public folder here
we get said index.php file which is
responsible for getting any incoming
requests and then funneling it through
the level framework you could say now we
uploaded this whole folder to Beanstalk
and therefore Beanstalk shifted to our
web server on ec2 on this virtual server
the issue is the incoming request
therefore it doesn't hit the public
folder it hits this folder the whole
folder and there we simply don't handle
it this is in the end the reason for
this error we can easily change this
though let's go to the configuration of
our environment of the Prada environment
here and there under software
configuration we can configure anything
related to our server which is running
here so if you click on this Settings
icon
we can set a document root and this is
exactly what we need here here we can
decide from which folder from which
subfolder the server should in the end
serve our fuzz or where the request
should basically be handled and we can
set this to slash public so that now we
target the public folder and there it
will then automatically you reach the
index.php file with this tiny change we
will fix this error now what else can
you configure here a couple of service
specific settings about compression for
example if you want to display errors
and until when you want to or when you
want to terminate incoming requests and
some settings about logging now we don't
need that but this public thing here is
really interesting with that let's click
apply here and this will update our
environment now this operation takes a
couple of seconds we can still reach our
application during that timeframe most
of the time at least but then at some
point it will restart the web server and
after that if we visit the application
again this looks much better
unfortunately the next issue isn't far
away if we click on register and try to
register here we get an error we get in
sequel error that the connection was
refused and this makes sense we're
trying to connect your database in the
level code but we got no database here
by default no database is created on
that virtual server wishes spun out by
elastic Beanstalk behind the scenes now
we could install a server on this ec2
instance by the way you can always have
a look at this instance by simply going
to the ec2 service and they're under
instances you see that there's one
running instance this is the one which
was spun up by elastic Beanstalk so we
can see that here and as I said we could
install a database on my sequel database
for example on that instance but the
issue we would then have is that we have
to fully manage that database it then
runs on our own server we have to backed
data up we have to make sure that we are
protected against failures if the server
for some reason goes down if we ever
want to switch the hardware or upgrade
to a bigger server we'll have to do
everything about that switch on our own
so we have to fully manage the database
and that is a huge disadvantage for big
enterprises that's of course doable and
pretty common but for you there is a
much simpler way of quickly adding a
database to your stack let's go to
configuration again
and as you can see we are in the web
tier or here are a couple of options
related to the
so to our website you could say now if
we scroll down you see there always a
data here and here we don't see any
options as of now but we can attach a
database to our elastic beanstalk
environment here we can create a new RDS
database and RDS stands for relational
database service
it's another service provided by AWS
which allows us to spin up database
instances so database servers with a
configuration of our choice again
regarding the power and then with
database on these servers now this is a
fully managed service so here we don't
have to take care about backing the data
up or updating software that's all done
by AWS and they're always a free tier
option available here so that we even
don't pay a dime for the first year as
long as again we stay in some boundaries
as set on the pricing page by AWS so
let's click create a new RDS instance
and we're taking to this wizard here we
could create this instance based on an
existing snapshot which would basically
copy old data into this to be created
database I don't want that I want to
start with a blank database we can
choose the DB engine and I'll go with my
sequel here now a sequel is included in
the free tier and the version of the
engine as you can see we get a couple of
different versions five point six point
two nine three four three five or six
two six point two nine the instance
classes are really big one here I'll
scale this sound to t2 micro to stay in
the fridge here and then we have to set
up a root username and password with
which we can access this database server
I'll choose root here and also a
password now here I just set up to
automatically create a snapshot if the
database server is ever going to get
shut down so that the data is safe the
fourth shuts down and that we don't want
to copy that cross-multiply bill ability
zones which is fine for this example
with that let's hit apply and now it is
the starting and mute database instance
using that RDS service
and on that database instance so on this
database server it will also
automatically create a new database this
will take a couple of minutes but once
this is starting up we can already think
about a new issue we have to solve in
our environment in our application if we
have a look at the dot and fall which
again manages our settings here we see
that the database connection is set up
by default it uses the local host
database username these are all settings
for our local development environment
for whom sted specifically in this case
obviously these values are not correct
if we use the database host it on some
server created or managed by AWS now
instead we will have to enter the host
so the address of this database server
then the name of the exact database on
that server and our credentials now I
could already enter the credentials we
just set up in a couple of seconds ago
actually but it would be nice if there
would be a more dynamic way of getting
access to these values in the end
elastic beanstalk is managing everything
and it turns out it also gives you
access to the database settings on the
server superglobal how does that work we
can go to the config folder in a lateral
project and there we have this database
PHP file in here we manage the
configuration for the database and if we
open this again with any text editor of
your choice
you see that here we can configure which
default connections used you see that's
my sequel and then for that connection
things like the host the port the
database username and password and these
are exactly these things
we need to define all you need to pass
now outside of this return statement at
the beginning of the file we can now
define a couple of Global's the first
one could be named RDS hostname and the
name here is totally up to you you can
name this globe whatever you like the
value is not up to you though here we
should access our server superglobal
and on that superglobal we have the RDS
hostname very low property we can access
this property is populated by elastic
Beanstalk in the end it passes us this
value with every incoming request so
that we have a chance of dynamically
retrieving our database value and
accessing the database and whenever we
change something about the database we
therefore don't you to adjust our
lateral code so that is the hostname I
need more than that
for example we also want to adjust the
user name here or get the user name and
we can get this on this server
superglobal and there on the user name
property RDS username then we want to
extract the password and we want to get
this too and now where is this request
is of course not sent from your client
this is something LS it Beanstalk passes
your application once the request is
basically or has reached the backend
already so this is not exposed to any
users and finally the name of the
database this is a database created by
being stalked we have no idea what its
naming it and here we can simply
retrieve it without having to worry
about the name with these clothes setup
we can go down and for example here
replace the host with the RDS host name
global which will host the host the
database here can be released with the
DB name and the username obviously with
the username whilst we can set the
password well equal to RDS password
whoops
RDS password here with this this
database PHP file is prepared and it's
now able to well retrieve that data or
that information dynamically and
therefore connect to the database that's
not all we all need to change something
else remember that we could only choose
for or between database my sequel
versions 5.6 something we couldn't
choose 5.7 and level 5.4 the version I'm
using here actually requires my sequel 5
point
seven or higher or a certain command at
the point of time we run migrations will
fail we can already set this up too and
DISA Stan in the app folder under
providers under app service provider
there if you open that file you should
first use schema here at the top to
import that schema pass aid and then in
the boot function simply execute schema
and there the default string length
method method and set it to 191 this
will overwrite the default level
otherwise assumes which is not possible
when using or which will lead to an
error when using an older my sequel
database version as we're doing as we're
forced to do in our Beanstalk app with
this command however we will prevent
this from happening it leads us to a new
issue though or a new thing we have to
think about migrations if we were to
deploy our code to our server right now
we would probably be able to connect to
the database but what do you have to do
the first time you set up your level
application on a server be that your
development environment or the
production environment you have to run
your migrations because of course in
this project too I set up a couple of
migrations here in the database
migrations folder one for the user's
table and one for the posts table and we
have to run these migrations right at
the start when you deploy this app for
the first time to make sure that these
tables are created in the database
otherwise nothing will work now for that
we can run the PHP artisan migrate
command but how do we run that command
on a server which is not on our local
machine there are different ways of
doing it you could connect to this ec2
instance which it was created by
Beanstalk via SSH you could set up an
SSH connection and then manually execute
this command in the lateral folder on
the server that is doable on Windows you
will need extra gab program or
application to run SSH though
a different alternative or generally an
alternative is to take advantage of
behavior or elastic Beanstalk offers to
you you can create a new folder here in
your project and name this dot EB
extensions
now the name is important it should have
a leading dot and it should be named EB
extensions after the dot inside that
folder you now can create files which
have to end with dot config which will
be run by elastic Beanstalk
every time you deploy a new version and
therefore here I can simply create a new
file when we first enter container
underscore commands and this is not
something you can choose this as a
command or a setup a configuration
basically detected by elastic Beanstalk
then indent with a tab we're using the
yamo format here and add a name of the
command this is now again totally usable
by you the commands you list here will
be executed in alphabetical order though
and more information about this file can
be found in the link in the video
description all name is 0-1 in it DB :
again indent and then here command : and
then the command between double
quotation marks which you want to
execute and this will be PHP artisan
migrate this will now migrate all your
fault
make sure to implement this fix I showed
a couple of seconds ago before you run
this so this fix regarding the default
string length and what's that you can
now save this file
in your root project folder a name it
for example in it config now course make
sure to in the end place it in the study
be extensions folder here and with that
disk file look at executed by elastic
beanstalk and the command in there will
be executed to thus migrating our files
now of course it will execute us
whenever you deploy a new version too so
for newer versions you should probably
not include that because migrate would
fail then since the database tables
already would exist and that is why
connecting Y is SH and running the
command by doing this or by well having
that connection might be the preferable
way for such one-time-only tasks like
this one but I want to show this
capability r2 and of course there are a
couple of ways of automating this whole
elastic beam stuff proces even more for
example with the elastic Beanstalk CLI
back to our example your though we can
switch back to the elastic Beanstalk
console and it just finished here and
with that we can go back and create a
new bundle we want to deploy
so let's first delete the old one and
then select everyone here everything
here and compress it again this again
will take a couple of seconds and this
new sip for now has to be deployed again
I'll first rename it to letter ville
simple blog video but the name is
totally up to you and back in the
elastic Beanstalk console you can now
click on upload and deploy to upload a
new application version here I'll choose
this new file which holds the changes
regarding the dynamic database
connection this initialization script
and this fixed for lateral 5.4 with
older my sequel databases and we can now
hit deploy this will now upload the code
again and then exchange to code the old
code with this new one whilst doing that
it will not restart the ec2 instance or
anything like that so we can still
access our application while it's doing
that but after a couple of second
the new code will be live and can be
used by us it already finished let's
click this file here and let's now try
this registration again I'll again enter
my email address here and my password
and click register and I get a
connection refused error well it's kind
of deceiving if we have a look at the
fraud environment we see this ok at this
check mark and everything looks great
but actually if we scroll down we see
that it failed to deploy the application
so it simply didn't update the code it
rolled back to our old application code
now this error can be really strange at
first it looks like we messed something
up in our agamas and tells us invalid
llamo but actually this is related to
how mac and you can see a hint here
stores hidden folders even though we
can't see it here there is like extra
subfolder in there you can simply fix
this error or this strange behavior by
going into the terminal into that folder
so where it is zip file can be found in
executing set - d wearable symbol block
the zip file and then underscore
underscore mac OS x /e x slash start and
this will remove this annoying folder in
there with this out of the way we can
try uploading this again so let's choose
this zip file again now we have to
define our own version label since the
old one is already taken since you
already tried it with the same filename
from which is infer set and now let's
see if that works so let's wait for this
to finish uploading and now hopefully it
again it will replace our application
code this time hopefully successfully
and hopefully it now is successful
running this initialization command
setting up our database and adding the
tables in there now that looks much
better
let's visit our web page again and let's
try this registration process here again
now we're forwarded now it seems to
successfully
user there's already hit the database
and at center post and see if that all
the works and it does now we get the
application working on elastic Beanstalk
with a dynamic connection to the
database as you saw there were some
gotchas we had to take care about as I
mentioned there are of course more
flexible or better ways of deploying
everything through the elastic Beanstalk
CLI you can automate a lot of the stuff
you saw here but this is how you can
ship your applications and there is
nothing wrong about this approach so if
you got a lateral application which you
want to host this is how you could do it
and for the first year as long as you
don't use any other services at least
this will be for free that is how that
works in another with you I want to take
a closer look at elastic beanstalk and
what we can do any configuration what
all just stop on the lectures about
hopefully see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
