the last video where we already created
our very first nodejs application as I
mentioned at the end of the last video
what I want to do in this video is give
you some more fundamentals JavaScript
fundamentals for working with no cheese
no I'm obviously not going to make it
showers for the course in this one video
here but there are especially two things
that I want to explain because we'll use
them a lot when working with nodejs and
it's important to understand them in the
next video we'll have a look at my IDE
and what you can do in an IDE and
especially in phpstorm or webstorm here
in this case to make working with node
as easy as possible so I'm back in my
workspace here and what I did is I just
create a new file the app that she has
file in your folder this folder
structure is only due to the reason that
I will upload the cover to get up and
there I will provide this folder
structure so it is very easy to well see
the code of each each video there so in
this app that she has file I first want
to demonstrate you the concept of
modules modules in nodejs we're in
JavaScript here now if you watched my
English you with you you already know a
bit about modules but there we use
typescript um I want to show you how we
use modules in no G as with pure
JavaScript so in the last video what you
did is we created or note yes server to
do this we had to import or to require
here the HTTP module now this HTTP
module is a core module of notes yes
that's why I don't have to provide any
path here obviously there is no HTTP
file in this folder as you can see but
it is yet a core module which will
automatically be loaded by nodejs
and what we're doing here in this very
first line is we're importing us it with
this required statement here and then
we're basically binding it to a variable
and through this variable
then be able to access this module and
everything which is exported in this
mushroom so all the functions and
variables which just module exposes to
our module or to our application to work
with therefore we were able to call the
HTTP create server function which is
basically such an exported function in
this HTTP module now I'm just going to
repeat the step of my first video where
I create a server listening on port 8000
to make it as easy and I'll just copy
the code because for the time being it
will be exactly identical so now we are
using this HDB module now care we will
also write our own modules sure we can
because we want to structure our app
such that we don't put all our code in
one single file but instead we'll split
it over several files such a structure
where we split our code is much more
easy to work with to demonstrate you how
we write our own module I'm going to
create a new JavaScript file in the same
directory and I will just call it module
1 s inside this file what I want to do
is I'll create a function and I will
call it my function and what this
function should do is it should just
lock something to the console function
was called for example I'll also create
a variable called my string which let's
just say string know if I want to access
these this function to string in this
file I get no possible that you do this
to do so now to make the function and
variable available outside of this file
I can use the modules object which is
automatically counted as far as though
to say each file will have its own
module or check can then use in other
files to export certain parts of this
file that I want to be
available in our files I'll show you how
to do this at the bottom of this file
here I'll use the module object here I
call it and there I use the exports
properties have to say the experts
keyword here and then I will just create
or bind the my function to a my function
object I created here or properties of
to say note this line here I'm exporting
this my function function and I'm making
it available in other files by binding
it or setting it into my module of check
yourself to say can do the same with the
string and with the variable here module
exports my string can be well my string
by we're here at the function make sure
you don't have the parentheses here we
don't want to execute here we just want
to pass a reference now in my app touch
as file right below my core module HTTP
I can import my own module by typing
required and then we're in the same
directory therefore I use dot slash to
show that I don't want to navigate away
here the module one chase file and don't
type dutchess just module one without
the file ending now let me save this and
now you show that this works I'm going
to replace this hello world here with
module 1 dot my string and I also want
to print out module 1 or I want to
execute my function here here any the
parentheses because now we're executing
it now in order to see something let me
run this file here and that here in the
browser we see the string which is
exactly value I set to very good word
exporting through this module and here
we can see the console function was
called why do we see it two times
well because basically two requests are
sent with each request so to say but
we'll see this in a later review so this
is for working in this is how we can use
modules now one thing is this is very
tedious
we have to export everything on our own
which you want to use right so let's
let's use an easier way I'll create a
new file module to duck shares and in
this file I want to export everything
everything every function every variable
everything which lives inside this file
I can also do this with the module
object year end of the exports
properties here to say but then I just
use a JavaScript object set it equal to
the JavaScript object and now everything
which I write inside this JavaScript
object will be available number files
and obviously as there's a JavaScript
object to make sure that if I export a
function I would do it like this my
function : and then just the function
and that I can print out export it and
let's say I also want to export the
variable here so I will again have my
variable and what the : this could be
exported variable just reformat that get
so now in fjs I can again which has
typically duplicate this and here I will
import module to and to show that this
works well I'm just replacing module two
here and module you here because I have
my variable variable and my function and
now let me rerun this file here and this
should be my variable I just recognized
let me rerun it now and now you can see
we get two x exported here because this
is what we're printing out we calling
this function and if we add a people up
in the browser and we load here we got
exported variable yay
so this is working and if you're
wondering by now I have four times
exported here in the console that's just
because I have two browser windows over
here only see one so I sent two requests
and they forgot this for prints
so this is how we use modules how we can
structure or application with several
files and import and export the contents
of these files now another very
important thing that we use often not
only no GS but also JavaScript our
anonymous functions and what is this
it's very simple basically in our app
touches here we're calling this on
request function or we say hey execute
you on request function but we don't
have parentheses here we're just setting
the reference to the function which
should be executed and we could also use
this function here put it in here with
all the AutoZone requests here reformat
a bit and now this would be an anonymous
function we're not creating the function
it's our deciding in the name and then
telling this function here to use that
name but instead well we're creating the
function here at the place where we will
need it and we do this a lot you will
have seen it a lot holes on the end of
two videos but don't just be aware that
this is just number concept of creating
functions in places where we need them
instead of creating them assigning a
name and so on which you would do
you would reuse this function several
places but in this case it might be good
to do it this way but I think it's a
little bit easier to read if I outsource
this function so to say so I'll leave it
this way okay so this has been modules
and anonymous functions and obviously it
could tell a lot more about JavaScript
basics but that are some things that
were really important for this course I
feel and that is why I wanted to get
them out of the way the next video was
about get ID then we'll continue writing
our applications see you there but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
