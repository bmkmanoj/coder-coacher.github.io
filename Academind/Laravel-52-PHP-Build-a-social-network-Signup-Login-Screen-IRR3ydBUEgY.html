mainly talking about the folder
structure and what laravel is so if this
is the first video where we are tuning
in you're welcome
we altered a short glimpse at fuse level
and at the blade templating engine so if
you're not familiar with that you
probably might want to watch the last
minutes of the previous video otherwise
we'll continue from here so as a sad
we'll build an application where we'll
be able to log in or to sign up then to
log in to see posts of our people to
like and dislike those posts and two
great posts ourselves we might throw in
some mailing later but that's the core
functionality and even though you might
think okay that that sounds not too
difficult it has quite a lot of
components which well you have to do
right authentication database access
those are two very difficult topics in a
way that you can mess up things there
and they tend to influence the security
of your overall application on the other
hand and then there are parts that you
will encounter in a lot of client
project and therefore it's good if
you're able to do them right
so in our application where we will
start this video is we'll build that
sign up and sign-in screen so that
should we like to welcome view we
currently have just with let's say a
sign-up form and next with the sign-in
form as I said I don't have that readily
prepared a number window so I'm kind of
coming up with the design and so as we
speak
and I think that's something cool and as
this video isn't about design and don't
worry there will be lot of design and
CSI videos coming up on this channel I'm
just going to throw in the bootstrap CSS
framework so that I've got something to
work with and we can focus on laravel um
so let me just grab that so now in a
bootstrap site and I'm just clicking
here on download bootstrap and that very
first link is currently all I need
I'll just copy that and I go to my
master and in the Hat section below my
trial in this case here I'll just copy
it in and now this link will be
available in all the pages which inherit
from that master layout so let me save
that and in my work a few as a sad I
want to have two columns um with format
each of those columns and additionally
now that I think of it we also need a
header which on our starting page won't
hold any items because well we can
navigate anywhere we have to first sign
up or sign in but in the later stages of
the app that haver will actually allow
us to create a post to maybe see all our
posts and to see all posts in the
timeline so therefore let me create that
header first and I'll create a include
folder here include includes and the
name is purely up to me or up to you in
this folder I'll store files which will
be included or can be included by me by
our views or by for example our master
layout which the end just is a normal
fear normal PHP file here so I will
create a header plate or PHP file and
again the dot blade dot PHP is very
important otherwise you won't be able to
use it in conjunction with the blade
templating engine and inside this file
I'll now just yeah I'll just go to
bootstrap again because I want that to
be very simple I'll just grab their
navigation bar over here which is
crowded with with stuff I won't need but
I'll get rid of that in a second and
just toss in some header tags before I
copy all of that in and now let's see
the brand okay that can stay but I don't
need that unordered list here I don't
search form and I don't need that
unordered list so I got rid of all the
menus and if we now reload we don't see
anything because here we created a
header but we're not including it yet so
let me go to my master layout here and
write a plastic container in the body
section I'll add an hour template
expression the add include expression
and in quotation marks I specify the
path to the file which should be
included in this case it's Nick includes
directory then dot to access the
directory and then the header file again
without light dot PHP at the end so I
now included that header and if we
reload yeah we now see that header great
so we got that back to my welcome whew
as I said I went to two columns so first
create a row because we're here in the
bootstrap framework and then I will
create a column with ruler which should
be half the size of the screen so six
column six because we have a twelve
column grid in bootstrap and I'll just
like of it later because first I'll
create my form here with a method of
post and this might be the signup form
so what I'll have here is first a form
group which is a bootstrap class to take
care about the alignment and so on of my
form elements for my inputs in this form
group I'll have a label and the first
field will be my email address so I'll
just write your email and then I'll have
an input field with a name of email and
an ID of email and I'll and I oh that's
important almost got it
I'll need to add the form control class
for bootstrap so that all looks nice now
let me copy that to time because this
time instead of mail I'll have my
a let's say my first name because we're
in the signup area here and yeah let's
say we don't care about a second name to
keep that lien but we want to know the
first name so that's fine and here we
want the user to enter a password so
just replace email with password here
and I'll also replace the type of text
to password so that the characters are
hidden now I also need a button so let
me just create one button submit of type
submit and this will get a class button
button primary so that should be that
blue button this blue bootstrap button
you see and half the websites out there
now let me copy that whole column here
and this will be our sign-in form so I
don't need the first name here but the
rest will be the same what I also want
to do is I want to add a little heading
to tell the user it's just what the
forms are meant for so sign in and sign
up let me reload yeah why are they not
appearing next to each other home 6
because that is not valid bootstrap
syntax I have to specify the device
width or size so I'll target medium-size
devices and all devices which are
smaller than medium sized which if I
remember correctly our tablets and
mobile phones in the bootstrap framework
here will show that those two forms not
next to each other but beneath each
other so now we now we get a few I want
and if we like bring in the inspection
area here and if I resize this window
you can see once your
getting to this break point here at 992
pixels it seems then this form breaks
and it is stacked a stack view here so
now we got the form ready for us to
enter some data and yeah obviously you
could do much more to look at pretty but
the video is not about styling ordered
series it's not about styling so I think
that's fine and we we added that our our
first few so we did that now in the next
video I will actually get a little bit
deeper in tolerable and not just do all
that front and stuff which yes part of
level the plate templating engine is
part of lateral but in the end were
running a server-side code here
server-side framework so we will have a
little bit more than just styling some
HTML files right see you next video
