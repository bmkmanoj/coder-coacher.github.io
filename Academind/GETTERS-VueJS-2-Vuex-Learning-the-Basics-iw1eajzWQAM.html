specifically on view X this video is
part of a series and in the first video
off the series I already had a little
starting project to which you can find a
link in the video description where we
already added view X and a central store
and state here decode to the finished
project off that first view as mentioned
can be found in the video description in
this video here we're going to refine
this a little bit and have some best
practices
starting with gathers now what is that
and how do we use it we'll see it in a
few seconds so what are getters and why
would we need them right now if you have
a look at the two components I'm using
the project registration but we can
register a user and registrations where
we can see all registrations
we're always fetching the registrations
or the user array here in a computer
method and a computed property I should
say and there is nothing wrong with that
but we can do better we can outsource
this logic into our store so that this
code gets even shorter that we don't
have to falter here in the registration
dot view file for example why would that
be beneficial imagine an application
where we had an avro component which
also needs a list of all registered or
unregistered users then we would simply
have to duplicate this code and
duplicating code is never a good idea
instead outsourcing this filter into the
store and then simply somehow getting
the list of filtered users would be much
better and this is what I gather can do
for us so how do we define getters then
in your store file where we have to
state we simply add a new property and
surprisingly it's called Gators now
Gators is an object a JavaScript object
and there we simply define any name this
is totally up to you now let's name it
regice excuse me unregistered users this
is a fitting name since I want to get
back all unregistered users this simply
is a method and here like in a computed
property I pass the code or I execute
the code which defines what unregistered
users are enriched in the end gives me
back a list of unregistered users and
this is important a getter always needs
to return something and this is kind of
obvious if you have a look at the name
again it gets something and here I want
to return the state the convenient thing
is view X which is a package we
installed passes the state to each get
to each gather define in my getters
object here so I can receive the state
here as an argument again this is passed
automatically by view X and then if I
can then simply say return state users
and now I'm just going to copy my filter
code here from my computer property
let's add it here so now this is
returning a list of unregistered users
now how do I use to gather in my
component then here I can simply define
a computed property as I already do and
I need to use a computer property for
this and there I still access my store
but now not the state directly but
instead the gathers and here the
unregistered users this is the name I
gave this getter not like a method just
like a property now if we save this we
should see that the application still
works we have to list and I can still do
the same as before but we took the logic
for filtering for getting this list and
removed it from this component and
instead put it into the store the place
where it should be so this is already an
improvement now we can do the same for
registrations here I actually have to
computed properties so I can set up my
store gathers here too so besides the
unregistered users I'm also interested
in all registrations here I also get the
state as I do in all getters and I
simply return state registrations so no
super-awesome logic
here but still it's something we can use
or we need so this is my registrations
and then the total number of
registrations I can now also get that
here so I can simply say total
registrations whatever you like also get
to state here and then return state
registrations length just to show a
different way of using this this
registrations so now I do have my free
getters I'm already using the first one
now let's use the second and third one
to you and I still do it the same way as
any registration of you file set up a
computer property I already do have that
but their access getters and now
registrations now here unlike in the
first case it's less obvious that they
need save super much space but it's the
better practice of using a getter for
accessing the state than directly
accessing the state getters total
registrations would be the right gather
here with that let's save it and let's
have a look if I reload the app looks
good to me works the same way as before
here's another little improvement if you
have multiple gathers or you're using
multiple gathers in one component as we
do here in the registration dot view
files there actually is an easier way to
quickly map those gathers to computed
properties because right now you have to
create a computer property per gather
and that can quickly become very
annoying therefore a view chess gives
you a nice little helper we can view X I
should say we can import it and it's
called map gathers in curly braces from
the view X package now map gathers as
the name suggests allows us to map our
gathers so here in the computed property
in my view instance in this component I
can now say map gathers execute it like
a method and this gets even an array or
an object depending on whether you want
to keep the name of the getter
in the store or want to assign it to a
different name in your component now
let's show the array first here you
would simply lists all the getters you
want to use so for example D
registrations getter simply add it as a
string this is important as a string
this is very important as a strength we
map gathers array and do the same for
the total registrations now here I want
to map them to different names though
because for total registrations I just
want to use total in musk in this
component in order to map it I have to
pass an object instead and here I simply
have my name first so the name I want to
use in this component for example
registrations and then as a string again
the name in D store the name of the
Gator here total this is the name of
what I use in the component and then the
name of the Gator total registrations
was the name we were using in the store
this one here which has copied so that I
don't have any typos looks good now I
can get rid of that don't need a
semicolon here and now this is not a
correct syntax here map getters is a
method and here we're inside an object
map Gathers gives us back an object so
what I can do is simply set map getters
to be the value of this computed
property computed a property in a view
component simply expects to get an
object and this will return us an object
an object with those mapped getters and
as a side note if you would have used
the array without mapping it manually to
different names behind the scenes it
would still have given us a an object
where we have the names mapped it's just
a name and getter name would be the same
then so with this if we save this reload
this again still works so that still
looks good
so that is a little convenience method
if you have multiple getters to map now
what is if you have additional computed
properties of though because map getters
takes up your whole computed property
this computed property space in your
so to say so if you had any other
computed property not related together
how would you add it you can
conveniently add it when using es6
syntax in this case you do have the
spread operator and this is this
operator free dots what this will do is
it takes the object again map catered
getters returns an object in the end and
simply pulls out the properties in this
object and distributes them in this
parent object this object here so it
gets the properties out of the object
returned by map getters and puts them
into the computer property object thus
allowing us to add additional computer
properties yet there's a typo but this
is what it allows us to do but right now
it would not work because this spread
operator is not supported by this view
seal I set up as of now we need a
special package to support it so here I
will simply install this for running npm
install - - save def because it's a
development dependency and then it's
called
babel babel is the transpiler
transpiling or es6 - es5 code babel
preset stage - because it's a stage to
feature the es specifications are kind
of published in stages so with that
added i also need to add a d babel RC
file here we need to add a new array
holding this stage to preset we just
installed this will allow the app to
compile correctly though you need to
restart the npm run dev process because
we added something we change the build
process so with that you see it now
works again and now you're seeing the
full power of gathers including the map
getters method to conveniently get
access to multiple gathers and map them
to your own properties keep in mind this
is only an option you can of course also
just map it manually as we do it here in
your registration dot view file in the
next video in this series we're going to
have a look at me
patience a better way of changing the
state because the way we're doing it
right now isn't really the most optimal
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
