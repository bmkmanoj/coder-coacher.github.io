firebase project and I quickly walked
you through all these course settings in
this video will now add authentication
to our application so let's do that
to add of medication let's first click
on authentication here and there we have
to choose a sign-in method so let's
click on setup sign-in method as you can
see if there are a couple of methods of
will you can allow your users to
register while phone they will then get
a code they can use by a Google Facebook
Twitter github or support anonymous
usage of your application I'm interested
email password here because this
actually is an option where you can
create your own user accounts firebase
will manage to storage in the database
and D validation all that but you can
allow users to sign up with your app now
of course you can easily add more
methods for example unlock Facebook by
for all method simply clicking on the
method and then clicking enable here and
that's all then it's safe and now this
is enabled they could do the same year
for Facebook there we also then need to
connected to our app ID because for
Facebook authentication you basically
have to click this link to learn more
about it to configure this from
Facebook's size - so I'll stick with
email password now that already is all
what you can now do is under templates
here you can define the email templates
because if users are signing up with
your own email password configuration
they will receive emails where well you
basically give them a verification link
and that's all handled by firebase this
whole email certification process and so
on is handled by a firebase so here you
can define which sender they actually
see and where it is email gets sent from
and of course the content of that mail
the same is true for password resetting
and an email address change and again
all handled for you by firebase now
under users you will see any users who
did signup known at the moment you could
also add users manually as an
administrator but we of course want to
embed this authentication into our
application so for that you can simply
click on web setup in the top right
corner here and this will actually then
generate the script code for you which
you need to dump into your application
queue set your application up however we
will not
use the script code as it is here
because I will import firebase a bit
differently I will still grab all that
code here don't need the messaging
sender ID but I'll go up to to storage
bucket here actually and now copy that
and now let's go back to our view
application I'll quit the development
server because now I want to install the
firebase SDK we need that when working
with firebase this allows us to not only
register our app with firebase but all
we use the SDK to easily sign users up
in and also for example later push data
to the database upload files all that
stuff now you could use view fire which
is a package which wraps the firebase
SDK in a view friendly package I'd say
taking advantage of some view features
injecting fire rates into your
application I won't do that here because
I want to show the general firebase SDK
which works just fine with you js2
because it's just a JavaScript SDK and
beauteous
uses Java Script so let's install it
with NPM install - - save - also store a
reference to be package dot JSON file
and then it's firebase and that's
actually all now we can hit enter and
this will install firebase for us now
with the installation process finished
we can now initialize firebase and a
great place to do so it's in the main
dot JS file in our root view instance
because we want to initialize it when
our application starts so here I'll
simply add the created hook lifecycle
hook to the root view instance and that
will be called whenever view Chase has
done creating our root view instance in
there I then want to initialize my
firebase application and for that I
first of all need to import firebase so
add that import here and the import
looks like that you import wild card as
firebase to import all exports of a
given file into one object where you can
then simply access the different
features from firebase this is one way
of importing everything off the firebase
package here an alternative would be to
simply use the named import and import
only what you want for example the
initialized app function which is the
one I'm reading here now I'll again
import everything though because I need
something else too but you can all just
pick the features you want to pick and
this is yeah this is another option you
have to optimize your final code size
though tree-shaking a part of the build
process should be able to get rid of
unused code you really want to optimize
everything only import what you need
so here again I'll make it easy and
import everything from firebase and now
once you certainly created method here
here I'll call firebase and then
initialize app like that q well
initialize my application here we need
to pass a JavaScript object and now that
simply takes the code I copied from the
web app configuration there due to the
linking rules applying here I'll replace
all the double quotation marks with
single quotation marks and that reaches
something the required by dead specific
project setup and the linting setup here
and of course the credentials here your
API key ends on will vary for for you
because you have your own API key you
should use that's just to set up my
setup of my project which I copied with
that we're initializing the application
and that ensures that we well that we
have our firebase app set up and ready
to be used
now with firebase configured we can
start implementing authentication so for
that I'll now go to my user page and I
want to start with the signup page here
I want to allow users to sign up into
Maya for my application now to do that
here
on now first of all at V container this
will allow me to use to grid again with
a V layout and then a v-flex element in
there now on reflex all again at X is 12
sm 6 and now offset sm 3 q have it
nicely centered and not take to pull
with on bigger screens in there I now
want to set up my form and just as a
side note and create meetup we assigned
these directives here to each reflex
element now I'm keeping taking a
different approach saving up some code
by wrapping the whole form in this
already centered and styled create that
of course the more elegant way I just
wanted to show both ways and also show
you the flexibility we have with the
grid system now here again this is my
this is my V flex element in there I now
want to set up my form and I actually
want to wrap my form in a card using V
card there I'll add V card text and I
did show you the card documentation in
an earlier video go back there or go to
the beautiful card documentation to
learn more about the available
components like we card text in there
I'll again use the container to critic
to rate in there in that card and now
I'll simply use form element here remove
the action because again I don't want to
send a request I want to instead
submitted through beauteous later and in
the form I'll now create my row should
add row here to to the top one V layout
and then that be layout of course now my
reflex elements here I will take the
full available width which is already
constrained by that we flex element here
so now inside these flags here I'll now
add my V text field using the text field
component provided by beautifier and
there I'll assign a name I'll name this
email because I want to fetch the email
address then a label mail data ski
helper text the placeholder we're
displaying to the user and then ID of
email now keep in mind we're using that
email password sign up provided
fire base so we definitely need to fetch
these two pieces password and email so
that's the first thing I'll then add the
model here to also bind it to an email
property which I have yet to add and
I'll add type email to make sure that I
get an email optimized input keyboard
shown on mobile devices for example
finally I'll ask you required validator
to take advantage of the built in
validation beautify ships with and also
use the html5 validation now that is one
thing that's my email next Adam just
said I always meet the password so I'll
replace email here with password also
the label here with password of course
that property to which I'm binding here
doesn't exist yet - so I'll also create
that it should be required and I'll next
add another row here that row will be my
confirmed password so here I'll name
this confirm password because I want to
make sure that the user has to confirm
this password and I'll adjust you'll
able to type still is password bell
chords because it's still a normal
password field here that shouldn't
actually be required instead here I'll
use a different rule which will write
myself because of course the validation
rule for that field should be that it
should be equal to what we entered into
password and I'll set up my own rule for
that well with that I'll add one last
row here will never be layout row below
my input field here with a reflex
element inside of it and there I now
want to add my button so add V button
here and that button will be off type
submit' so that it is the button
submitting our form at the end and I'll
next also add a caption to it sign up
now with that I got my but now that I
got my form finished next I'll add the
script section here to export my default
object for that view come
in here and now there of course need to
register my data property where I
returned an object which actually
manages my email my password and my
confirm password property to which I'm
binding so your email shall be an empty
string initially passwords shall be an
empty string initially and confirm
password shall be an empty string
initially so data is my setup here for
the signup process next what I want to
do is I want to provide a method which
allows you to submit everything so under
methods here I'll add on submit or maybe
let's name it on signup that's the
method I want to call once we do submit
the form here so this is does this and
now here I of course want you reach out
to firebase create a new user and I will
actually do that via a view X action
because I also want to store that user
in my view X application store of course
so here I will use view X before I do
that though let's simply console.log the
values for now and come back to
implementing these signup logic in the
next step and first make sure that we
actually do validate everything here
because I told you that I want to
implement my own rule for the password
confirmation so for now I will simply
log email this e-mail password this
password and confirm password this
confirm password just referring to all
the properties stored in my data now the
rule I want to add to the text field
that's something we can find on the
beautify page here if we go to the text
field component documentation at the
very bottom of the component section and
scroll all the way to the bottom we see
that there indeed is a rules property we
can use to set up our own rule
for a for one of the inputs and here we
actually can pass a function we can use
a computed property here to be precise
so what i can do is i can create a new
computed property online view instance
here and I'll name it compare passwords
and here I will actually check if or I
will return if this password referring
to this password property which is bound
to one input field if that is not equal
to this confirm password and if that's
the case I want to return password do
not match passwords do not match of
course otherwise I'll return an empty
string now this computer property
therefore return the string
ebrill add one if passwords are not
equal or that one if they are equal now
the interesting thing is the rules array
I can apply here takes a function and
the functions actually have to return a
string for example they can also in
converters in the documentation they can
also return true or false true means
that we that we do have a validation
error or if you have a string which is
not empty you also signal the same and
then that string is also already the
error message which you could output so
what I'll do here is I'll simply bind to
the rules property and I need a colon
because I want to bind a dynamic value I
want to pass in an array where I send
compare has words into that so compare
passwords referring to my computer
property
now let's restart the development server
with NPM run death to see if that does
work as it should
now submitting won't work because I
haven't added a sign a submit listener
but we should already see something on
the signup page here and we already see
that confirmed password is while showing
us an error now let's try an email
address here
has resumed of match here we see our
error message which is output
automatically but you define and that of
course is the message to be defined as a
return value for the computer property
as soon as that you enter the same
password this goes away though now if I
click sign up it resets because now we
well we don't listen to the signup field
now why is it constantly showing an
error here even though passwords are
equal we only have one rule here to me
that really just looks like some strange
back here to be honest because it should
be valid if I remove the rules here then
it's gone just really looks like it's
constantly highlighted or something like
that not really showing an error so
that's probably something which will get
fixed if you know a fix definitely feel
free to share it in the video
description for now a little bit with
that what I want to do of course next is
I want to do something in view X once we
do sign up now I'll do that in the next
video and we'll also then manage our
sign-in process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
