here in this video we'll have a look at
progressive Web Apps a super important
topic extremely hot these days and a
topic on which I created a very
comprehensive course on udemy link can
be found in the video description of
course now in this video though I want
to share the first module of this course
with you there we'll have a look at the
most important question what are
progressive web apps we'll build our
first little progressive web app
together and we will learn which topics
make up a progressive web app which
features now we'll probably use some of
these features in future projects on
this channel and therefore I'd be more
than happy to welcome you on the course
but first let's dive into the first
course module and learn these basics I
mentioned
while I can't do this course it's great
to have you on board in this course
we're going to dive super deep into the
topic of progressive web apps now
progressive web apps that is a term
which is pretty hot these days but it is
a topic which is definitely here to stay
progressive web apps in the end describe
a set of features of technologies you
can add to your existing web
applications to turn them into native
app like native mobile app like
experiences using device features like
the camera and providing offline access
now in this course you will learn all
about what progressive web apps are why
you might want to use them and you will
of course use them and learn all the
core technologies that make up this term
progressive web app you will of course
all learn this by building a real course
project and adding these features step
by step will start simple but will soon
add a way to install our application on
the home screen of a real mobile device
we'll find a way of making our app
available even if internet connections
lost and will do way more will access
the device camera and location will be
able to send push notifications and
synchronize data in the background even
if we are offline this is what we'll
build and learn in this course now who
is teaching you my name is max moon
Schwarz Mullah and I'm a freelance web
developer I worked a lot with
progressive web apps and I can tell you
there's never been a better place or
time to learn it the features which make
up progressive web apps are well
supported already you can already reach
a huge audience with all these features
and the cool thing is you build
progressive web apps in a way that your
web apps still work on older browsers
too now is the time to learn it to be
prepared for a future where probably
every web application will be a
progressive web application since it
offers significant advantages and makes
your application much more enjoyable to
your users
so let's dive into progressive web apps
by answering one important question
first what are progressive web apps
it's a term which you might have heard
already but sometimes it's hard to
really say what it means in the end
progressive web apps is just a term
referring to a couple of features you
can add to any web application to any
web page running in the browser
therefore to enhance it this is what
progressive web apps in the end are
about you progressively enhance your
existing web pages to feel and work more
like native mobile apps I'm not just
talking about responsive design so that
it looks good on both devices we're
doing this since a couple of years
already or you should be at least I'm
talking about other things you know from
native mobile apps like your app working
if you're offline it having an icon on
the home screen
things like accessing the device camera
or the location synchronizing data in
the background these are all features
which were hard to do in web
applications in the past nowadays we got
browser support in a lot of browsers for
that and we can therefore use that now
in this course I will show you how to
use all these technologies which make up
a progressive web app and of course I'll
also explain which technologies these
are and I will show you how to implement
them in a way that it also works on
older browsers that your web page still
works on older browsers because that's
the core thing you progressively enhance
a web application it's not at all or
nothing move it's not like it doesn't
work on older browsers anymore it just
means if you have a modern browser on a
mobile device you get an awesome
experience otherwise you'll get the
experience you've gotten anyways there
are three main words I'd say by which
you can summarize progressive web apps
they should be reliable which means they
should load fast and even work if you're
offline at least a part of the
application should work if you're
offline now this is really a core thing
of progressive web apps we're talking a
lot about that initial load the first
time you wizard an application
you open it because if you consider
application running on your mobile
device most of them start up pretty fast
so long loading times you don't want
that additionally it should be fast not
just during load up but also when sand
runs it should react to user input it
should provide animations it should be
able to access native device features in
an intuitive way and we also want to
make sure that it's engaging we want to
get our users back into the app we want
to offer features like push
notifications to inform them even if the
application is closed yes you heard that
correctly this is what you can do and
what we will do in this course so that
is what makes up a progressive web app
now why would we want to build one
obviously we have some good arguments
here but couldn't we achieve the same by
just building a normal mobile app with
Java Android or with Swift objective-c
well let's find out which arguments
speak for a web app instead of a native
mobile app
let's compare native apps with mobile
apps to find out if it makes sense to
build a web app to begin with here's a
number of which might discourage you but
no worries I'll say more about this
number over the next seconds if we have
a look at the usage of our smart phone
here's a report by comScore from 2015
made in the u.s. we see that the average
smartphone user spends 87% of his time
in native apps whereas only 13% of the
time go into the mobile web so the user
visiting a web page in the browser on
the mobile phone now it is clearly
discouraging because why would we build
a mobile web app if a native app is so
much better let's first of all find out
why people spend so much time in native
apps one important factor are push
notifications they drive them back into
the apps you get a push notification you
tab on it you're back into the app push
notifications communicate with you even
if the application is closed even if the
phone is tucked away into your pocket
additionally we have home screen icons
which make it easy to start yet you pull
out your phone you have some time to
spare just open one of the apps and
that's it this is how you use it right
that's harder for web apps web pages of
course you can't add them to the home
screen but it's not like you're
prompting the user to do so you don't
have the app store where people would go
and search for you so getting on your
home screen traditionally has been hard
for a web apps it's a huge plus for
native apps though additionally we have
access to native device features like
the camera geolocation and other things
and of course many native apps also work
offline at least a certain part of these
apps were it's offline
these are all good reasons why people
are using native apps now as I already
said the cool thing about progressive
web apps is that we can basically bring
all these things into the web too so
maybe this can switch relations that's
not the only
argument for the mobile web though even
though today a lot of the people are
using native apps let's have a look at
some arguments against native apps one
argument is that you of course have to
learn two languages if you want to
support iOS and Android or you need
multiple developers what be nicer if you
could just write our application in the
language you already know HTML CSS
JavaScript and so on so if you could
just use web application now the better
argument is this number though even
though the majority of users uses native
apps 80 percent of the time goes into
the top free apps which unfortunately
probably isn't your app it's most likely
Google Facebook whatsapp something like
that so there's only very little time to
spare for our apps and here's one our
figure how many new apps do you guess
does the average user install per month
on his phone or her phone does you get
something 1 5 10 its zero absolutely
zero the average user doesn't install a
new app you install new apps if you have
a new phone but thereafter you rarely
add new apps these are the statistics
that makes clear that the web has
something big to offer its reach let's
compare the reach we have the top
thousand native apps and web pages
visited from mobile in the native apps
we have 3.3 million users in the web
apps we have 8.9 so even though less
time goes towards the web more people
are visiting it we can reach a broader
audience there the reason of course is
connected to the figure of the eighty
percent being spent in the same app
people do spend a lot of time in native
apps but always in the same apps the
average app doesn't get that many
visitors now the web has a huge
advantage you don't need to install
anything from the App Store which takes
time in which you have to do actively
you search for something Google shows
the result boom you're on your webpage
you take a bookmark and you're back so
this is how you
the web it's so much easier to get onto
these web pages and that's a huge
advantage off the web now since we can
get advantages of the native device
offline access camera ends on to the web
combined with that figure
sounds like progressive web apps aren't
that bad of an idea let's confirm this
hypothesis by having a look at this
comparation
we have native apps and traditional web
apps so no progressive whether a
traditional web app which doesn't offer
access to any native device features if
we compare them by capability and reach
the native app of course has awesome
capabilities we can leverage the
operating system and access a lot of
native device features on the apprehend
the reach isn't that good for the
reasons we heard about a web app on the
other hand a traditional one doesn't
really have access to all these device
features it probably doesn't run offline
so that's not too good but the reach is
really good you can find it while Google
it's just one address in the URL bar
away a progressive web app now combines
the best of both worlds there we can
access a lot of the native device
features we can make it available
offline and we do have good reach of
course because it's still a web app
still running in the browser this is
well we will focus on progressive web
apps in this course and while learning
them really is a good idea you can get
the best of both worlds and deliver
awesome experiences to your users
so over the last lectures we learned
what progressive web apps are and why we
might want to build our next web
application as a progressive web app now
let me show you an example for a
progressive web app at F dot F T com
you can wizard the application page of
the Financial Times this runs in the
browser but it is a progressive web app
it feels a lot like a app if we navigate
around there with the animations and the
menu and if I open my chrome developer
tools and I switch into device mode by
pressing this icon here you see of
course it also looks like a mobile app
now a cool thing happens if I now do the
following if I go to network in the
chrome developer tools which as strongly
recommend using I recommend using Chrome
for this course because it supports all
the features you're going to learn about
and its developer tools are awesome more
about this later so if you go to network
and click on offline here you can
simulate that you're offline now if I
reload that page you still see some
content the images are not there I give
you that but you can still read that
article here this is because it is a
progressive web app offering you some
nice features now Google even built a
tool which you can use to judge how well
a site performs as a progressive web app
and it's built right into the developer
tools if you're using the latest version
of Chrome it's light to cows a day if
you don't have the order tap here though
you can simply search for lighthouse
Chrome and then find the page where you
get installation instructions about
lighthouse you can add it as a Chrome
extension dead now if you do have that
audit tab let's perform an audit on the
Financial Times page here and this will
now do a couple of checks to find out
how well this performs as a progressive
web app let's wait for this to finish
and analyze the results so the test is
done and overall the page does okay a
couple of features are missing which
would make it a really good or awesome
progressive web app and the performance
isn't that great here but that might
also be connected
my performance here on the machine while
some recording so this is a decent
progressive web app implementing a lot
of the features and I will also explain
in one of the next lectures that it is
okay to not reach 100 here you do have
the choice between going all the way to
it not at all or any step in between you
can add features off that progressive
web app world as you need them in your
app so this is nice now I wanna show you
a number page you can't open that
because it's offline but this is the
course project we'll build it say
Instagram clone a simple one of course
as a progressive web app it looks and
feels nice in my opinion the cool thing
is that this of course is a progressive
web app now one thing we can do is we
can take an image so let's allow camera
access and hey Here I am so let me
quickly take an image here you'll see
I'm sitting in front of a green screen
let's also get my location so I'll need
to allow that to fetch it
it'll be masked here I don't want to
show my full location and then let me
enter some title during my recordings
and keep in mind this is in the browser
it's just looking like on a real device
throughout the course though I will also
show how the app runs on a real device
so for now let me click post here to
post this now let's say for syncing and
if we reload there it is already so this
has been saved on some server now again
you can't access this page here but you
will build it on your own and we will
also ship it to the web at the end of
the course now thus far you might think
it's nice that camera thing is nice but
not super impressive now let me turn off
my Wi-Fi here to really have no internet
connection anymore if I reload the page
you can ignore these errors because they
are basically catched and I still see my
page even my content here and I can
still navigate around now there's one
more thing I want to do for which I will
need internet connection so let me
quickly turn it on again I want to
enable push notifications so let me
click here and allow access and now I
get day
push notification here on my other
stream so unfortunately this isn't
recorded because push notifications were
turned on now with dead let me now go
offline by turning off the Wi-Fi and now
I'll try to send another post let me
take a picture and that sent us from
offline mode I'm in Munich let me a post
here and it's also saved for
synchronization
now clearly it can't send it I have no
internet connection so let's say I now
come back online because my Wi-Fi
reestablishes connection now it's
syncing this and if I reload the app
here it is from offline this is what
makes this a progressive web app a lot
of the features you might know from your
native apps but you haven't seen that
often in a web app this works fully
offline it caches everything at all
accesses to device camera has pushed
messages as you saw and much more so now
let me conclude this by making an audit
on this app too so that you can see what
you're going to build in this course
let's perform an audit here with
lighthouse again and let's see how many
features about progressive web apps I
packed into this application and what
you're going to learn in this course
therefore I'll be back once this audit
finished the audit finished and here you
can see I got a 100 in progressive web
app so this is a perfect progressive web
app using all the features that make up
a progressive web app you see the ever
met ryx are also amazing and that means
you're going to learn a lot of useful
things in that course because we'll
start from scratch we'll build this app
together and add all these features that
lead to this 100 together can't wait to
get started with you
now that we learned a lot about what
progressive web apps are and why they
are awesome let's build our first very
simple one and for that as I already
mentioned it
please use Chrome I strongly recommend
it because whilst we will build it in a
way the course project I mean then it
also works on older browsers you of
course want to see all the new features
you're using right and Chrome is one of
the browsers which supports most of them
work all of them actually we will use in
this course so I recommend using it now
throughout the course I will always
highlight which browser supports what
but again chrome is the one supporting
everything
additionally the developer tools are
awesome I'm going to use it and it'll be
easier for you to follow along if you're
using Chrome of course you can go back
to your favorite browser or author of
this course again then besides Chrome
will also need note j/s now we're not
writing a server-side application here
but no J's ships with NPM its package
manager and it's the defective package
manager for development projects for
front-end JavaScript development
projects and we will use a tool to
install some dependencies mainly one
dependency a development server to
really simulate that our application
runs on a server even though it runs on
the local device so make sure to is it
node.js org and simply download the
latest version if your problem if you're
having problems with that choose 6.11
instead or whatever the latest a low
version is at the point of time you're
viewing this so make sure to download
and install node.js again we're just
using it to bring up that development
server and to manage our dependencies
our libraries and so on once you got all
of this setup attached to this lecture
you can find a download download it and
open it in your favorite IDE sublime
atom webstorm Microsoft whistles to you
code whatever that is this is the
starting project we'll use here later
this course will use a different project
though now you're first of all with no
chase installed you need to open up your
terminal or command prompt on your
operating system and this here is the
normal terminal just integrated into my
IDE and navigate into that project
folder and in there simply
npm install NPM refers to this node
package manager we installed
automatically together with node once
you hit enter distance will install all
dependencies which is only one in our
case you can check it in the package the
JSON file it's this HTTP server here now
this simply is a development only server
why don't we just double click on the
HTML files because if we double click on
them we use the file protocol and that's
not HTTP and for that reason all the
features I want to show you won't work
because it's not really served like a
web application we want to simulate it
as such though and test it as such hence
we need a web server and this is a super
simple development only server where we
don't need to write any code to get it
to run our app once you did install it
you can run NPM start in the same
terminal and keep that running because
the server needs to keep running and
then here you see the URL under which
you can see your application
now let's out MIT by simply navigating
back to the browser and entering your
entering it here you could also open
localhost 3000 by the way and you will
see this is the application I want to
start with it lays a nice little
animation showcasing the advantages of
progressive web apps and what you're
going to learn in this course it's nice
but it's a normal website let's turn it
into a progressive web app together back
into your project open the public folder
and there you see that SW dot J's file
that's going to become important I'll
explain what it is a Service Worker
later in this course now for now let's
go to source j s and then the app dot
J's followed here's a very simple code
to run that animation by simply adding
CSS classes every X seconds now before
we execute that let's do something else
let's run navigator dot serviceworker
register and there has a string where
you point to slash s wjs so basically to
that file that's all for now
just add this line now save it and
thereafter
load your page now let's open up the
developer tools and go to the
application tab should click on
serviceworker you now see that this is
populated we'll come back to what
exactly happened here later in the
course
you also see I'm previewing this as a
native device or as a mobile device you
can always toggle between these displays
I like this quite a lot because we're
building something which should look
good there so why don't we use it here
and now with that let's take offline
here or under network offline
also make sure you disable the cache
here under Network now if we reload the
page you see it still works even though
we have no internet connection anymore
and you could say yeah makes sense it's
running on my local machine right yeah
but if we take the offline button your
Chrome will basically simulate that this
internet is is off that this browser
can't connect to this server and keep in
mind we have a real web server here
because we did start one we didn't just
double-click the HTML file as I
explained so this really is working in
offline mode and if you don't believe me
go to the application serviceworker and
click unregister there and reload again
now you get this there is no internet
connection screen this is our first
application where we successfully
register a serviceworker so that our
application works even if we are offline
now we'll learn much more in this course
but this is a great first step and we'll
build up on this and learn how we can
use different strategies to decide what
to store for offline usage and what not
how to add these push notifications and
much more I can't wait to dive into that
with you so if that let's not lose any
time and let's continue seeing what
exactly makes our progressive web apps
and which features you're going to learn
about in this course
thus far we already had a look at what
progressive web elves are why we might
want to use progressive web apps or
build them and what we're going to build
in this course now when I have a look at
the core building blocks technologies we
use when building progressive web apps
because thus far we only had some
buzzwords we heard about offline access
and push notifications but let's now
really have a look at all the features
we beus and you'll learn about in this
course when building progressive web
apps a core feature our service workers
service workers are supported in modern
browsers like Chrome and service workers
are basically JavaScript running in a
background process even if your
application is closed service workers
are a core building block because they
allow us to get offline access to cache
some files and serve them if we don't
have an internet connection and they
also give us access to other progressive
web app related features for example
background synchronization sending a
request once internet connections we
established we use service workers for
that Porsche notifications would be
another example we use service workers
for that because they are running in the
background independent of currently
opened tabs service workers therefore
our D core building block and I have a
couple of modules diving into all the
different things you do with them also
advanced lectures advanced modules
you'll learn a ton about them in this
course service workers are not the only
building block whilst we can use them
for offline access background
synchronization web push and more the
application manifest is also an
important building block you're going to
learn about this in the next course
module already the application manifest
makes your application installable on
home screens not installed through an
app store but instead well you will see
it you can basically install a web app
and then we'll do more than just open
that web page a web manifest is
therefore a super important and another
feature you typically use or you use in
any progressive web app you're building
and then you can add more and more
features now besides the acknowledged
we use responsive design is an average
or balding block now to be honest I
won't dive too much into it in this
course because there already are whole
courses covering this out there and
responsive design is something we're
doing since a couple of years already
so therefore definitely make sure you
notice and I will touch on it in this
course but I will focus on all the new
technologies all the things which aren't
covered that well in the internet yet
now and then there are other things like
the geolocation API or the camera API so
that we can access various native device
features and I will dive into that in
this course too these are the core
building blocks in the end always keep
in mind progressive web app is just a
term it in its closest definition refers
to app which uses service workers and
has application manifest but it
typically also means applications which
are responsive which offer backgrounds
which use web push and more and you're
going to learn all of that in that
course
now that we learned about the core
building blocks let me make one
comparison which is sometimes made and
which is kind of wrong single page
applications and progressive web apps
now in case you don't know single page
applications are applications web
applications powered by JavaScript
typically created with a framework like
react angular or view where the
framework re renders the Dom all the
time to react to user input to display
different pages once you only have one
single page one HTML fall single page
applications are not the same as
progressive web apps and actually
progressive web apps as I mentioned it's
just a collection of technologies and
techniques and it runs totally
independent of your app being a single
page application or not you can turn any
single page application into a
progressive web app and the same is true
for any traditional multi page
application where you render your views
from your server by a node PHP whatever
it is so this is the wrong comparation
a single page application is powered by
JavaScript as I said typically using a
framework it has highly reactive because
things happen instantly because we don't
send the request to the server and wait
for a new page and as I said we only
have that single page a progressive web
app is just a collection of technologies
can be used anywhere it typically also
uses a lot of JavaScript because the
serviceworker for example uses
JavaScript and your serviceworker is
very important but the serviceworker
isn't controlled by any framework
anyways so the JavaScript use here can
be vanilla JavaScript without a
framework and actually in a course
project will use a project which just
uses vanilla JavaScript and multiple
pages because I wanted to show the most
flexible project I can to really show
you that what you learn in this course
can be used in any project no matter if
that's a single page app or not towards
the end of the course I have a module
where I show you how to turn your react
angular or view app into a progressive
web app but for the majority of the
course I just show you code which just
works in any project no matter if single
page or multi page now a progressive web
app still also aims to will be high
react if you could say but here we're
focusing more on the initial loading
time we want to get something onto the
screen fast for example by caching it by
even making it available offline it's
not so much about what happens
thereafter of course there are some
things we want to use like animations to
provide a nice user experience but we
don't care if you load new pages for
every request or if you use JavaScript
to re-render the page often times you
will see single page applications being
progressive web apps as well but as I
mentioned that's no hard requirement and
finally as I just said progressive web
apps can work with multiple files too
and actually that's not that uncommon
you can absolutely use progressive web
app anywhere you can turn any web page
into a progressive web if you want to so
that's the wrong comparation
we can use the progressive web app
concept on a single page application but
we can also use it on any other
application
there's this other cool concept I want
to emphasize as well it's a progressive
web app what does the progressive
actually mean it doesn't mean you can
use the device camera indeed it
basically means that we can
progressively enhance our web
application so let's consider this
starting point we have three different
web apps one is a legacy web app so an
older web app using older technology and
probably also supporting older browsers
then we have an existing modern app
which is maybe also a traditional web
app not not a single page application
nothing fancy but it targets modern
browsers because maybe it's an internal
company tool or some page which mainly
addresses tech infuse yes something like
that and maybe we have an upcoming
project and there we can pretty much
Bank on people having more modern
browsers because support is already
getting better more people are using
modern browsers it's probably going to
be better in the future too so if these
free different apps can we only turn the
upcoming project into a progressive web
app now because rewriting an existing
app from scratch certainly is an option
so if you want to turn this into a
progressive web app you can't just start
over well let's have a look at the near
future we can simply add some features
to our existing app and this is actually
something I will show you in the course
we will take a project and add features
step by step and you can stop at any
given point you can stop after adding an
app manifest and a basic Service Worker
you can stop after you implement the
basic caching advanced caching push
notifications you can stop all the time
now your existing modern app here you
can maybe open some more progressive web
app features and for the upcoming
project yet there you can start from
scratch obviously so you can fully
implement it as a progressive web app
right from the start and plan everything
with that in mind now in the further
away future our older application might
use some more Malta
progressive web app futures but not all
of them and it's perfectly fine you
don't have to use 0 or 100 percent you
can absolutely use 40% of all the
features you learn in the course pick
the ones which enhance your application
and add them now therefore our middle
app here
maybe is a completely converted
progressive web app in the end because
we added all the features which make up
a progressive web app we have solid
caching and different circumstances we
use push notifications and all that
stuff and our upcoming project already
of course was planned as a progressive
web app and therefore also as one and
this is important because I know that a
lot of people are looking at all these
technologies and are saying well I don't
have the resources or the time to
rebuild my old app and I have to support
all browsers anyways these users are
never going to see the new features and
I can only answer you that's not a
problem simply add the features which
enhance your application right now and
feel free to turn it into a complete
progressive web app if you have the time
definitely consider it for all upcoming
projects though
you
so there was a lot of talking about what
progressive web apps are why we use them
and what we're going to build in this
course now let's see what exactly
we'll learn in this course and how we'll
walk through all these topics well right
now we're still getting started
but we're almost done and the next
module will have a look at the
application manifest this is days
document which tells the browser more
about our web application and you'll
learn everything about it in the second
module thereafter will already dive into
service workers because they are such a
core building block now service workers
and in general a lot of progressive web
app features use promises and the fetch
API therefore I'll have a short module
where I briefly refresh the knowledge
about these core concepts so that we're
all on the same page because we're going
to use a lot of promises and the fetch
API throughout the course it's easy to
use that I just want to make sure that
we all know what we're using there now
once you got that refresher we'll head
back to the service workers and learn
how we can use them to provide offline
access through caching well then
continue on this road and dive into
advanced caching strategies using
service workers to really have the right
strategy for which ever assets you going
to load in which every situation in your
app after that we'll have a look at how
we can catch dynamic content with
indexed DB because thus far we will have
cached assets like CSS files script
files images
now what about JSON data you get back
from a rest endpoint we can cache that
too and there you will learn how to pass
do that once we did that we'll have a
look at responsive design now already
said I won't dive into it super deeply
here because there are whole courses
about that and you can indeed create
whole courses about that so I just want
to give you some core features some
basics you need to know but I definitely
encourage you to pick up a separate
course on this topic it's super
important and more than I could fit into
this course where I really want to focus
on all the other core
technologies now with responsive design
added we'll go back to these new core
technologies and we'll have a look at
background synchronization next which
describes the process of us sending
something while store offline and
therefore of course it would fail but of
a way to store that and send it when the
internet connection is re-established
even if we did close the application by
then you'll learn it in this module and
thereafter we have a look at web push
notifications so how we can receive and
send push notifications even if our
application is closed now as a next step
we'll have a look at the media API at
geolocation these are not strictly core
features of a progressive web app but
since you typically use native device
features in progressive web apps it's
super important to know how to use two
of the most important and popular
features you can use on a real device
and I'll dive into this in this module
now after that we learned a lot about
different technologies and we'll see
that it can get hard to manage all our
service worker code therefore well then
dive into automated Service Worker
management I will show you a tool you
can use to make a lot of the things you
had to do manually before easier by
doing them automatically once we did
this I'll dive into single page
applications and progressive web apps to
show you how to turn your number one
favorite framework application into a
single page application with these with
that we'll have learned a lot this
course will do more than just get you
started with progressive web apps it
will really allow you to use that
knowledge dive deeper use it in your
next project and I'm super excited to
get started so let me spend one more
word about the course project setup and
how you get the most out of this course
and then we'll get right started and
dive into the application manifest
I hope you enjoyed this first module of
this course now there we had a look at
what progressive web apps are and why
they are awesome
obviously I'd be more than happy to
welcome you in this course so that we
can go through all these topics together
and then also of course use some of them
in future projects on this channel
hopefully see you there have a great
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
