for our WordPress basics series where we
were building our accustomed team now we
stopped when we had some basic styling
for our navigation or when we added up
our navigation at all let me just run
our project here so that we can see it
again open it in a new tab and over
there we'll see our beautiful beautiful
application with our home about sample
page on our footer and our basic post
thing here now today there are two
things below the first one is we will
tidy this up a little bit here our posts
we will make it possible so that we have
a shorter excerpt on our front page and
the full post only available on our
single post page when we click on our
post which is impossible as of now which
we will also add now and our fingers if
we click on your about page here you got
this our posts headline here and the
same is true for a sample page and this
is obviously wrong because our posts are
only here on our home page now why and
why is our post headline show now
because we only got an index dot PHP or
in other words which files do we have we
have our content well this is where the
content of our posts lives so not freely
the headline or anything like this now
we got our footer or header or obviously
our files functions totally wrong so we
all together it makes the PHP and what
WordPress that has to do is render
everything with the index of PHP and
this is the file where our posts is
written so we will divide this file up
to put it this way in two different
files we'll add a home dot PHP file
which will show our home screen we'll
add a page to PHP file which will be
responsible for rendering our pages and
we will also add a single dot PHP file
which will be responsible for displaying
single posts now these names I didn't
make them up you have to use these names
because they
part of the wordpress system in
WordPress will look for these fights in
a specific order red we will have a look
at this order right now so let's do
before WordPress template files and I
think this link here should help us a
template hero tree and yeah or if it's
cruel I only got this nice little
picture here so let's have a look at it
pardon we can see what actually happens
if we're going on our front page it was
first looking for a front page to PHP
and then that's some our checks and that
will continue to looking for a home dot
PHP for our front page if it doesn't
find it it will take the extra PHP if we
have an archive page who will go into
archives in a later video does this
overview page when we folder for all
four other categories it will look for
is some specific pages first then for
more generic what's next for very
generic ones like only offered a PHP
category dot PHP next then for archive
dot PHP and then for index dot PHP now
if we have a single page like a single
post it will check for Simms and special
types first and for single post a PHP
1010 for a single dot PHP and for static
pages we can even provide a custom
template which people with them tell to
use or we got a default page template
which can then be page - the name of our
page like page - about that PHP or page
- PHP PHP at least and as you can see
here our blog posts index page will also
relate to the home that PHP and then to
the index dot PHP so what I want to tell
you is index dot PHP and that template
file here WordPress will always fall
back
if it doesn't find a more specific one
right and this is why we need to provide
a home the PHP a page to PHP and a
single dot PHP to really be able to
style it differently so let's start by
adding a home dot PHP file which will be
for our block index and I'm copying our
index dot PHP code here now with our
home that PHP added and content of
index.php pasted into it if we refresh
our website nothing changes in this is
because well we copied if committee code
right now let's see of the temp if
actually in our template their home dot
PHP is used so I just it inside he'll
load PHP text here and now we'll this
text should appear right here great so
we're now using our home dot PHP and no
longer or index dot PHP and that's
exactly what we want now let's create a
page dot PHP file page dot PHP for our
well pages and again I will start
copying this code here but now there
will no longer be written our posts
instead we want let's say the page title
to a period how do we do this WordPress
get a nice little head function for us
we put this function into PHP tags
obviously and here we add WP title with
no arguments now if we save this and
brief and go to our about page here we
can see okay now we get about here with
these two little arrows now if we don't
want these arrows we can remove them by
just entering an t quotation marks as
argument now we only get about now
obviously this might not look that nice
because we can get about about about but
it's just to show you that we're now
using different templates which again
are flexible for which pages actually
loaded like the sample page the about
page here now if we wanted the about
page to have let's say like a little box
at the beginning but not in the sample
page we couldn't do this by adding
another file the page - about dot PHP
now in this file I will again copy this
but I will add this box here in the
beginning let's say I just have a class
of infobox forgot that this does not
work the way I'm used to from my local
environment no problem
div info box here and enter some lorem
ipsum inverse statement like I think
this is enough now let's give it a basic
styling at the bottom of our style at
CSS the info box will have the border of
let's say one takes those solid in gray
should have a border radius of 3 pixels
should have a background color of very
light gray should have some padding of
say 60 pixels um
margin order should be centered you also
need to give it a width let's say like
200 pixels or 250 maybe hmm let's have a
look at it oops I also need to save it I
didn't save my page about pay PHP that's
why it found the file but didn't find
the changes you made to it okay so we
get our box here but centering it was
not my best idea now that I look at it
so let's remove the margin all this
statement here
and now we gotta cheer but mmm needs to
be why don't we give it just say 400
pixels here yeah so now we got this box
here and obviously you you could yeah
increases or say like this should be 50%
maybe so that it takes up more space but
the main thing is now we got our info
box here but when we click on a sample
page here it will disappear because this
uses the page the PHP whereas this uses
the page mine's about the PHP cool huh
so back to our home page we really want
our post should be clickable so that we
can go to a single post and here we only
want to expert to show up so to do this
first thing I am going to do is save
this change to whom the PHP so that this
inside home dot PHP text disappears and
now I'm just copying this opening and up
in a new tab with WP admin at the end
that I can go to my admin panel and now
inside my panel I can
first thing is I can update WordPress
but I'm not going to do this right now I
want to see my posts so I got two posts
at the moment hello world and I want to
have poor texture that's why I'm going
to Google for lorem ipsum the de in this
case but this is a nice site which just
creates some dummy or Mitsu text I can
then paste into Europe and a little bit
more like so heading between maybe it's
gift is bold so yeah okay this is one
thing and now I want to edit the other
posts then to oh it's very slow today a
cloud lines are risen it's been a faster
but no problem
can handle it I wanted to go to my post
title post your post contents and at my
dummy text maybe spaced this to the
right and save it now back on our home
page reload it we now got our low post
here does this clearly not what we want
right we want more like small
introduction here and then when we click
on it we want to go the actual post now
we got two ways to achieve this back to
our editor I'm going to this post here
and we got the possibility to enter a
read more tag and I'm doing this after
this first sentence here click this
button now we got this more tag here now
let's see what to suggest just save it
by clicking update refresh our homepage
here and now you see this post has been
shortened and we got this more tag here
and if we click on it then we got our
full post cool huh so this is one way to
do it now if we were to do the same for
this process would look a little bit
strange because our first sentence is
push to the right and this would appear
the same way and it's also too short so
we got another possibility here let's go
back to all our posts and edit this one
again and a word press we got the
possibility to add a custom excerpt now
you don't see an excerpt field here by
default but if you click on screen
options and then check excerpt now we
get an extra box at the bottom I can
write here this is a custom excerpt and
this text is you're obviously not the
same as
taxi rebuff and this gives us the chance
to have a totally different excerpt than
the text we're using for our main post
so I'm hitting update and refresh our
home page and hmm nothing changed this
is the case because we're telling it
still use the content and how it does it
how should it know that we wanted to see
the excerpt not the content so we have
to edit something here in our content or
PHP where we display the content and we
have to do it here in this position here
I'm going to add a PHP tag here and say
if is single
else
and if
now if this is a single poster should
display the content otherwise it should
display the excerpt another WordPress
function and now if I hit save and
refresh this home page here we now see
okay now we get our custom expert here
but now this doesn't work anymore
because now we're over writing its
default behavior by telling it okay if
it's a single use the excerpt and not be
content anymore or put another word it
is still working where we're only seeing
the excerpt the first sentence here but
we no longer what I read more tag here
to add them we have to go to our
functions dot PHP and add on you and add
a new function like let's say at excerpt
read more this function takes as
argument the excerpt and it returns the
excerpt and adds to it basically
whatever we want to add at the end which
wouldn't have to be read more tag it
could be any text or link we want to add
but this case going to add to read more
attack so let's add maybe free dots now
add our age ref equals some link we
don't have to figure out then the read
more text close our anchor close our
string now we will have to add this
function and what we're doing this by
using app filter and this is basically a
function which is called when certain
events happen this case they get the
excerpt hook and then it should execute
the add X or read more function right
now save this and refresh our homepage
now we can read more link which isn't
doing anything because because we didn't
set the anchor yet so let's do this now
therefore we have to skip out of our
string and now we some only to figure
out what is the link to the single post
and thank God WordPress has a function
furnace they need to get permalink
function we need to pass an argument
here because this function my default
couldn't fetch the link we need so we
need to tell this function there the
link to which ID and therefore we used
to get the ID function save this refresh
our home page and now if we click on it
we're taking to our complete single post
now as you might recognize actually
we're currently not using single dot PHP
for our posts but this will still be
rendered in our index of PHP and we will
take care about this in the next video
as well as with some more styling and
our cool stuff so hope to see you there
have a nice day good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
