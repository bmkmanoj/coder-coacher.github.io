can find some videos about power of the
I already feel free to have a look at
these if you want you but if you really
want to dive deeper into the tool and
get kind of very well more comprehensive
introduction then I also got a ten hours
udemy course about power bi it's called
power bi a complete introduction well
and in this video I want to give you a
course excerpt this means you get the
first hour or think the first fifteen
minutes to be more precise of this
course to get an idea of power bi about
the content of the course and about what
you're going to learn in there you can
also find a link to the course down
there in every description
but for now have fun with the excerpt
and especially have fun with power bi
let's start with the answer to the most
important question first what is power
bi actually if you look at the homepage
you can find the following text so power
bi is a suit of business analytics tools
it allows you to work on data to create
reports to publish that reports and a
lot more this sounds really great but we
have to take a closer look at that to
really understand how this works so we
already know that power bi is not a
single tool but consists of multiple
tools additionally we have that building
blocks let's see what that is the first
tool is power bi desktop the local
application only available on Windows in
power bi desktop we have the first
building block the data sets now what is
a data set a data set simply describes
the data or the information that you
have in your data model you can either
connect power bi desktop to predefined
data sets so you simply import the data
into the data model and then you're done
or you can create your own data sets
this would mean that you connect power
bi desktop to different source files in
so-called queries we will talk about
that throughout the course and then work
on those queries as soon as you finished
your work you will then load that newly
created structure into the data model
and by that have your own data set now
in both cases you are not done right
here because you want to visualize your
data right to do this you need the
second building block the visualizations
a visualization is simply a chart or a
table so everything that well visualizes
your data with the visualizations we
have the third building block the tiles
tiles are simply the area of your
visualizations it's a kind of tea frame
around it you can change the height or
the width and the position of the tiles
just as you prefer the only limitation
is the space on your report page reports
yes we also have report
in power bi desktop and reports out a
fourth building block you can simply
create multiple pages with different
visualizations just as you prefer well
and the summary or the combination of
the pages this is the report so this is
power bi desktop you can create datasets
and visualize the data in visualizations
and the combination of multiple
visualizations on multiple pages this is
the report then now the second tool is
power bi service this is a cloud
application and by that not limited to
Windows only which allows you to share
your results and to collaborate in your
projects with your colleagues but if we
look at two different building blocks we
can see that those are equal to the ones
that we just saw in power bi desktop now
what's the difference power bi service
can of course be connected to different
data sets but the creation of that own
data sets we just talked about in power
bi desktop so the connection of
different source files then the work on
those queries and by that the creation
of that new structure that you then load
in your data model this is not possible
in power bi service so power bi service
is the tool to connect to existing data
sets power bi desktop is the tool to
create new data sets in that's an
important difference however as we can
connect power bi service to those
existing data sets and also that created
data sets in power bi desktop of course
we can also create visualizations and
reports but the functionality of the
creation of the visualizations and of
the reports well we know that from power
bi desktop already right so we will not
create visualizations and reports in
power bi service in that course we will
learn how this works in power bi desktop
and the functionality and the interface
as I said when it comes to the creation
of that visualizations is the same
between those two tools now what else
can we do in power bi service then well
we talked about the sharing and
collaborating and we will learn how this
works but there is one additional
building block that is only a
empower be a service and those are the
dashboards now what is a dashboard well
when we talk about a dashboard simply
think about a cover page so one single
page which summarizes the key facts of
your report this is the dashboard so
this first page you see if you want to
dive deeper then you can jump into the
report and get more information about
your data so this is the second tool
this sharing collaborating tool with the
creation of the dashboards let's quickly
summarize what we learned so far we have
power bi desktop the local application
where we can create our data sets our
visualizations and our reports we then
publish that information to power bi
service the cloud solution in there we
can also collaborate with colleagues for
example if we want or add dashboards to
our existing data so we have the data in
the cloud now if we now use the virtual
power bi mobile a mobile app as the name
says this will allow us to access the
data that we loaded to power bi service
from our mobile devices and we will also
take a look at power bi mobile of course
and see how this app works and what we
can do with it so those are the three
core tools of power bi that we need and
that we will talk about in detail
throughout that course but we will show
you more we will show you power bi for
developers also on power bi for
developers is made to customize your
power bi experience this means you can
create your own customized visuals and
you will see how this works throughout
the course and you can also embed your
power bi results into your own existing
apps with power bi embedded something
that is rather related to your own app
and not directly connected to power bi
because of that we will not cover this
topic as part of this course however
with that power bi for developers Brooke
we now have an overview of the entire
power bi universe that we will talk
about throughout that course and now I
think it's time that we start with
first little project right let's do this
and let's start with the first tool
power bi desktop the local application
well in to work with this local
application we first have to download
and install it let's do this in the next
video
we want to create our first little
project in power bi desktop let's now
download it and connect it to the first
data so this is the homepage of power bi
that we saw in the last video if we now
go to products up here and select power
bi desktop then we have two options
download and advance download options if
you press download then B download will
immediately start and then you can
install power bi desktop but you
couldn't choose your language and you
can't change the language after you
install power bi desktop so I would
press advance download options right
here
if you then scroll down then you can
select the language you want to install
power bi desktop in right here I will
now select English and press the
download button and I hope you do the
same and then you can simply follow the
installation guide and after that we
will see each other when we start power
bi desktop together for the first time
we install power bi desktop let's open
it now and when you open power bi
desktop you can see this sign-in option
this is not necessary at the moment as
we will work locally in power bi desktop
we will talk about that sign in later
when we talk about power bi service the
cloud application if you want to sign
into power bi desktop right here you can
of course do that the only thing you
need to know is that you need a work or
a school email address you cannot
register with a gmail address for
instance however as we don't have to
sign in red here we will simply click on
to get data now right there and now you
can see that you can connect power bi
desktop to multiple data sources now one
quick note before we start in this first
initial project so in this and the next
two videos I only want to show you how
easy to use power bi desktop is and how
quickly you can create your first
visualizations so in case you don't
understand everything I'm doing right
here don't worry we will talk about
everything you see right here and about
more throughout the course so for the
moment just follow my guidance and enjoy
power bi desktop so back to our get data
function so we need data and we don't
have any so why don't we just get some
data from the web to do this we simply
can click onto that search bar right
here and type web like this and if we
now select the second option right here
and press connect at this button then we
can see that we have to enter a URL
right here well as we don't have a URL
right now we have to look for one let's
do this
so a good data set for all first initial
project would be GDP data for instance
for different countries also you can
find data like that if you search for
the IMF World Economic Outlook database
so the second result right here and down
here we have the link that we need
another note at the time when I recorded
that video the April 2017 version was
the latest one in case you watched this
video later you might have a more recent
version this doesn't change the applied
steps that we will do right now the only
thing that changes of course is the data
now let's click onto that April 2017
version right now like this now we
select by countries appear here we can
select all countries here we click
continue in the right upper part we said
that we want to have GDP data so let's
select the ones at current prices in US
dollar right here
press Continue and now one less time
then we got it
press prepare report right here and now
we got a table right there this is good
and we could also download that table
right here but we don't have to do this
because we can now simply select the URL
right there and copy it into our power
bi desktop file let's do this
so I now paste the URL into the
field and press ok now the Navigator
opened and the navigator allows us to
select the information that we want to
retrieve from that web page so the
information we want to connect power bi
desktop to basically in the left part
you can select the different parts of
that page so if you click onto document
right here for instance you see that
this is not the table that we want let's
maybe change from the table view up here
to the web view like this and now you
can see that the page is categorized in
different tables and we can also see
that table null is not the right one but
table 1 is the correct table so if we
select that by checking that box right
here which is then also ticked in the
left part right there and then take a
look at the table view again right here
then we can see that we selected the
correct data well now that we know that
we simply have to press well what do we
have to press no we have two options we
have load and edit again I will not talk
about the details right now you will
understand the differences between those
two options throughout that course so
just a quick information for the moment
if we press load then we will
immediately load the data into the data
model if we press edit then we will
first open the query editor the query
editor is kind of a separate tool in
power bi desktop that allows us to
prepare the data so for instance to
delete rows or delete columns or add
columns or a lot more and then load this
clean data into the data model as we
first want to prepare the data we will
click Edit right here to open that query
editor now let's press that and now you
can see the query editor with our
initial project data for the first time
let's take a look at what we can do
right here
we now connect a power bi desktop to
data time to take a look at the data in
the query editor so again this is
probably something totally new for you
you haven't seen that interface before
you don't know what you can do right
here and don't worry we will talk about
all that throughout the course for the
moment let me just show you how quickly
you can now clean that data then load
the data into the data model and then
create beautiful visualizations so we
are in this data preparation step right
here and what you can see up here in the
center where we have our datum that D
column names up there well those are not
really good a better column name would
be the second row because this should be
the country the subject descriptors
should be the second column and so on to
do this we have to apply two steps the
first step is we have to delete the
first row this one right here because we
don't need that information in here the
second step then is that we have to turn
this second row which will then be the
first row after deleting that current
first row so we want to turn that new
first row into the header the column
names
so let's first delete the first row to
do this we simply go to the home ribbon
right here and then click on to remove
rows right here and select remove top
rows like this now we want to remove the
top rows starting from the top which of
course excludes the column names so we
simply type one to delete that first row
and press ok now we see that this first
row is gone now we want to turn this new
first row into the column name to do
this we can stay in the home ribbon and
now press on to use first row as headers
right here if we do that well then we
also got this so those were the first
two steps we had to apply and with that
we are finished with the work on our
rows let's take a look at the columns
now so you can simply select a column of
course and then navigate with the left
and right arrow keys on the keyboard
so I think we should keep the country
column this
check descriptor the units and a scale
those columns are fine but the country
and serious specific notes I don't think
we need that now if you want to delete
that column you simply have to select
the column what we did right now
then again stay in the home ribbon and
then press remove columns right here
like this so this column is gone let's
now take a look at the remaining columns
and see if we have to delete anything
else
so those year columns are fine we will
talk about those in a few seconds though
and in the last column yes I think we
should also delete this column so again
we simply click remove columns and it's
gone so I mentioned this year columns a
few seconds ago because I think the way
we displayed at the moment is not the
best way wouldn't it be better if we
change that into two columns simply one
column being named years with all the
corresponding years in the corresponding
rows of that column and the second
column with the corresponding GDP data I
think so and what we have to do right
now is we have to turn this columns so
the see your columns into rows basically
so the column is named year and all the
rows in that column are the different
years to do this we simply select the
first column that 2015 column and now
press and hold shift on the keyboard and
select the last column like this now we
change from the home ribbon to the
transform ribbon up here and now we
press that unfavored columns function
again something we will talk about in
detail throughout that course but for
the moment we simply press that like
this and as you can see we simply turned
those multiple columns into one single
column with the years being single rows
in that column this was easy right let's
continue because we have to rename that
columns now because attribute and value
not the best names probably let's change
that quickly by double-clicking onto the
attribute column appear and now name it
year
this mmm press enter and do the same
thing for the GDP column well and name
it GDP like this now we get that and now
we should make sure that we only have
rows in that GDP column where we have
data for because we only want to import
the really important information into
our data model so we should take a look
at that now to see if we have any and
A's in this GDP column we simply click
onto that arrow right here now scroll
down and as you can see we have some
anaise so if we unselect that and press
ok those and A's are no longer in that
column and by that won't be loaded in to
the data model when we finish the work
in no Curia return you will see that of
course now we got that clean column here
so the only thing we have to do is we
have to change the format of the data in
here why should we change that well if
you look at that symbol right here this
ABC and click it you can see that at the
moment the CDP column or the values in
that GDP column are formatted as text
and this is not true so we should change
this and one way to change this is if we
simply change it right here from text to
decimal number for instance and as you
can see this symbol also changed now
from ABC 2 1 2 to indicate that this is
a decimal number now so this was fine
but what if you have to select multiple
columns or to change the formats of
multiple columns actually well then you
have another option in power bi you can
simply select the first column like this
and again select all the remaining
columns like that now if you go to the
transform ribbon again and press detect
data type right here like this then you
can see that the format of the first
four columns of course didn't change
because well those are texts so this is
fine but the format of the Year column
changed to a whole number now which is
fine for a moment and this is it
we now finish the work in our query
editor so in this data preparation step
for our initial project the next step
now is to load that data that clean data
into the actual data model and create
visualizations
we made a great progress in our initial
project time to continue so we finish
the work in that query editor if you
want to load the data into the data
model now then you simply go to the home
ribbon like this and press close and
apply right here if we do this then we
can see that the interface changed
because now we are in the actual data
model and again I have to repeat myself
you probably haven't seen it before this
interface and what you can do right here
don't worry we'll talk about that in
detail throughout the course for the
moment I just want to show you the
basics that we need for our initial
project so we are now in the so called
report view so we can create our
visualizations in this area we will do
that soon but first we have to take a
look at our actual data model to do this
we simply change from the report view
right here to the data view right there
and now you can see that we have our
different columns and our table actually
in that data model what we have to
change right here is the first column
this country column why do I want to
change that well in this column we have
countries and power bi has great
functionalities to visualize country
specific data but we have to tell power
bi that those are countries and not
simple text so to change this we simply
go to the modeling ribbon up here like
this and now go to data category in this
area and if you press that then you can
see that at the moment we have
uncharacterized data which is wrong
because we should select country right
here because that's the type of data we
have and we can find country right here
if we click that nothing changed no
that's not room we now have that symbol
right here so this seems to work let's
finally create some visualizations right
now to do this we have to go back to the
report view so we need to change from
the state of you back to here the report
view
and now to create a visualization well
you simply can go to this visualization
column right here and select a
visualization type by simply clicking it
so let's maybe create a stacked column
chart this one right here and after
clicking it you can now see this style
you remember that building block and we
can move it around of course but I will
simply increase it now or increase the
size so that you can see everything so
this is our tile now and we don't see a
lot because we need data and to add a
term you simply go to that fields column
right here
and now drag the GDP for instance
because this is the data type that we
want to visualize into the corresponding
field of the visualization and this
simply means that we drag and drop it
from here so I'm clicking and holding
the left mouse button and now drag it to
the value field right here like this
because I selected the visualization so
this area now refers to that
visualization however this chart doesn't
look good at the moment so we have to
edit some more information for instance
the different years - at the years we
simply select it right here and drag it
to the axis area right there like this
now it looks better but I want to add
more because you remember we also have
that country data so why don't we also
add this data to our visualization to do
this we simply select the country right
here and drag it to the legend field
right there
now our chart looks better but I think
we have too much information in that
chart so we might set a filter to only
see the top 10 countries by the total
GDP to do this we simply keep the
visualization selected right here now
scroll down in this visualizations
column and select the country right here
now we can scroll down a little bit and
change it from the basic filtering to
the top-end filter like this and now we
can simply decide that we only want to
see the top right here and if we click
into that box right here and defy
the top ten well the top ten by what by
the GDP so we simply again take the GDP
right here and drag it into that by
value field now we press apply filter
down here like this and you can see that
we now only have the top ten countries
in our visualization but you remember we
worked on the data model and explained
power bi that we have data for different
countries so maybe there is a better way
to visualize that and of course there is
if you want to change the visualization
type you can simply do this by selecting
a different visualization in this area
and a good visualization right here
would be a world map right now the good
thing is we have such a map right here
and if we now click that and you of
course still selected our visualization
so we click that now now the
visualization changed and now we still
have the annual data and here if you
want to exclude two years as you can see
right here and only display the total
values so the sum of all the years
included in that data model then you
simply go to refutes column again and
unselect the year right here and if we
then click right here into this
formatting area right here and add the
category labels then we can also see the
names of this top ten countries which
makes the visualization even better and
this is it we now finished our
visualization and with that our initial
course project and now that you saw some
of the basic functions of power bi
desktop and how easy to use it is you
probably want to know more and you will
of course and Maximillian will show you
now what exactly you will learn in this
course
now that manual walk you through the
basic building blocks of power bi how is
this course structured what does this
course have to offer for you and the
which part will be done by manual and
which parts will be done by me well
right now we're still in the welcome and
first steps part we're getting started
but we're almost done thereafter we'll
have a look at power bi desktop in
detail so how does it work what does
this tool offer before we then dive into
the query editor in power bi desktop
still how can we query data how can we
import data and how can we manipulate or
structure the data when importing it
well then have a look at the data view
the data view allows us to still work
with our data but not in the import step
but after we imported so that we
structure the data or manipulated model
it to our needs
once we have the data in the structure
the formatted the way we want to use it
we can move on and we can have a look at
the report view and we will this report
view will then allow you to well output
reports with tables with visuals with
measures as you will learn so single
values for example you can output and
that is of course the thing which is
most interesting to your executives for
things like that where you present your
data where you create nice reports with
the key results of your data thereafter
we'll have a look at the other parts of
the power bi universe as Manuel
mentioned it's not just power bi desktop
its power bi service in mobile too so
how can you collaborate on your data how
can you share it with others and how can
you access it from mobile devices now
apt at this point everything will have
been done by manual now I will create my
first module or show my first module in
the our data sources module I'll have a
look at some other data sources than the
data source is used so far in the course
manual will mainly work with a CSV file
since it's a very common data source but
I will then also show you how to work
with JSON data from restful Web Services
and my sequel or general sequel
databases thereafter another module done
by me I'll have a look at
you can create your own custom visuals
so that is custom charts basically you
could say for power bi here we will
learn how that works you will need a bit
of programming knowledge for that though
so that is certainly required or at
least a willingness to learn it but with
that you got a powerful tool of really
customizing power bi to your needs and
creating the exact chart or visual in
general you need well then after we had
a look at this manual will take over
again and do the roundup of the course
giving you a brief overview over voice
you learned and how you progressed
through the course so a lot of great
content walking you from A to C through
power bi and giving you a very complete
introduction to it
throughout the course you email are
going to work for course data set and of
course this starts basic and importing
it then adjusting the import your needs
and so on and therefore the course
project the power bi file will also
change now to give you a chance of
catching up if you are lost or if you
want to compare manual solution with
yours you can download the latest
version of the project from time to time
and you will therefore find zipped files
attached to some of the course lectures
now I'm going to show you how to use
these files because you won't have to
adjust your import paths since of course
you download them to your machine and
the paths will weary or will differ from
the ones manual used so here's how to do
that
you of course extract that file and once
you did this you will have the power bi
file and the source folder now we can
open the power bi so file and it will
open power bi desktop but as soon as
this is finished you will see that we
have an issue if we go to the query
editor in our case here and let it load
you see of course it doesn't find the
source file because it still references
the path on manuals machine and
unfortunately there's no way of avoiding
this since power bi needs absolute paths
so what you will have to do to fix this
is you will have to go to the advanced
editor here and here you can edit this
path and you should simply adjust it so
that points to your CSV file so in mine
case where I also store this on the
desktop I'll go back to my Explorer grab
this path here which is where the power
bi file lives go back to the advanced
editor and replace everything in front
of source because I still have that
folder in there with my path now with
that being done we can it are done and
you see the data is there if you still
experience issues you should hit refresh
preview to really force power bi to
update your paths and with that
unfortunately you'll have to do that for
all your imports here I know this case
inconvenient but this is the only way of
fixing these paths however once you do
have that path the new path copied or
stored in your clipboard it's really
easy to go in there and explain JIT in
all the places where it is used once you
did it exchange it everywhere where it
was used all the other queries which are
based on other queries where you did
actually import it should update
automatically so you don't need to
exchange it an all decrease only in the
quarries where you of course reference
these files queries depending on queries
for your reference that will be updated
automatically if they aren't hit this
refresh preview button I was mentioning
earlier and with that you should be good
to go and you should be good to use
these source files if you want to
compare manuals set up with yours and
want to see what he actually did there
and if something is unclear so that is
just a little help enjoy the course
so we finished
right now and had a basic overview of
the power bi universe now it's time to
dive a little deeper and we would start
our deep dive with the first tool with
power bi desktop let's first take a
quick look at the workflow of that tool
so generally we can divide power bi
desktop or the workflow in the tool into
three steps the first step is the data
preparation so the connection to the
source files and the cleaning of the
data we imported after we are happy with
that basic data we can then import the
data into our data model this is the
second step the data modelling here we
can continue our work on the data and
assume we finished our real data model
we can go to the third step the data
visualization now for all of those steps
power bi desktop has certain tools or
views let's see what that is supported
data preparation we have the query
editor this is kind of an integrated
separate tool which allows us to well
prepare the data right and to clean and
shape the data we want to have in our
later model we will have a look at that
query editor in detail in the next
module as soon as we finish the
preparation we need two things for the
data modelling we need the relationship
view and the data of you both views are
connected because you can create
relations between the different tables
and columns you have in the date of you
you have the relationship view so that's
why you have two views in your actual
data modeling part now for the last step
the data visualization you have to
report you this is the view where we can
create our visualizations charts tables
and so on
now we could continue talking about this
in theory but I think it's better if we
just switch to our initial GDP project
from the first module and see where we
can find those workflow steps and those
tools and views in the actual power bi
desktop interface let's find that out so
this is the last thing we saw in our GDP
project the only difference is the dual
box in the upper right part of the
screen
and as you can see we are now in the
last step so we are in the data model
but in the data visualization step and
the report view now how does this
interface work and how does this fit to
the workflow we see up there let's find
that out in the next video
so we talked about the workflow of power
bi desktop now it's time to understand
the interface so here we have the final
output of our GDP project and this means
if you are in the report view with our
final visualization so one important
note before we start everything we will
see in that video is the actual data
model so the first step the query editor
with the data preparation this is not
presented right here this is a separate
menu that has to be opened and we will
cover the interface of that menu in the
next video and the details on how we can
work with the key editor in the next
module nevertheless keep in mind that
there is a big difference between the
query editor where you prepare the data
and the actual data you import into the
data model which can be seen in the
interface we were talking right now a
lot after knowing this let's start with
the interface so basically you have four
core areas you have the ribbons on top
you have the left column right here you
have that Center part where you can see
the actual content of each view and you
have that columns to the right now I
talked about use the fuse can be
selected in the left column at the
moment we are in the report view and it
is displayed right here the report view
list of view where we generate our
visualizations now if we switch to the
data view which is the second button
then we see the actual data model so the
data we created and we worked on
throughout that data modeling step the
third button opens the relationship view
this is the view that allows us to
connect the tables in the data model
with each other so that's the first
thing you have to know you have three
views and you can select those views by
clicking onto the different buttons in
the left column now let's focus on the
right part of the screen that
visualizations and that fields column
the visualizations column well that
column allows us to select different
visualizations that we have a power bi
desktop for instance if I select our
world map like this and then press onto
that column chart then the visualization
type changes we did not change anything
about the content that should be
displayed if I want to change the
content then I have to change the fields
column or the selected columns in the
fields column so at the moment we
selected country and GDP and we don't
have a lot of data to play around with
at the moment so I won't change a thing
right here
now let's change that visualization back
to our map that we had by simply
clicking it and let's focus on that
columns because now I will switch to the
date of U and in the date of U we see
that that visualizations column is gone
this has a simple reason you cannot
visualize anything right here so you
don't need that column however the
fields column is still here and this
makes sense because you need that column
for instance to create measures you may
not know what measures are at the moment
but you will learn that so don't worry
but you can create those measures for
instance in both views in the report
view and in the date of view and this
might be a nice help if you are looking
at some visualization and you see that
you are missing some important
information that you need a calculation
for however in this course we will focus
on the actual data modelling and the
creation of such measures in the date of
view and in the report view we will
really only create the visualizations
and the outputs but you are free to work
with power bi desktop as you prefer
so I just wanted to tell you that now if
we select the last view the relationship
view we see that the fields column
disappears and this makes sense because
in this view every content will be
displayed as a box and by every content
I mean every table of the data modeler
with the corresponding columns because
this allows you to connect that tables
and that columns with each other however
you might note that we have table 1 and
then the column names which are equal to
the table and the column names in the
fields view so basically it's just
displayed differently with some
different functionalities but the
content is basically the same
now we understand the left column the
center part and the right columns so the
last thing we need to understand is that
ribbons part appear at the moment we see
five ribbons this is because I selected
our visualizations or our map
let me just unselect that by clicking
into the report and now we see that we
have three general ribbons so the home
the view and the modeling ribbon we'll
talk about the fire ribbon later so the
home ribbon doesn't change the only
thing that changes is the
functionalities that are available
depending on the view you selected for
instance the new page functionality will
only work in the report view in the date
of you we cannot create visualizations
so the available functionalities change
nevertheless the home ribbon is
available in all of the views as you can
see this is different for the remaining
two ribbons the view and the modeling
ribbon the few ribbon is only available
in the report view because you can play
around you can define how you want to
display your report and you could also
try out what your report would looks
like in a phone layout you don't need
that functionality in the data and the
relationship view though so if we change
the data view we see that we don't have
the huben the same thing is true in the
relationship you so that's another
outcome we know that the columns change
and that the ribbons change depending on
the selected view in the left column now
let's see what happens to the last
ribbon the modeling ribbon so here we
can model our data we know that and we
can do the same thing in the date of you
that's what we talked about that you are
free on where you want to model your
data but we will focus on the date of
you for that modeling purposes if we go
to the relationship view we see that the
modeling options are well reduced right
and this again makes sense because you
don't model your data in that view you
only create those relationships and you
can do that if you go to the home ribbon
and then select manage relationships at
the moment there is not a lot to manage
because we only have one
able in our data model but this is how
it would work and we will see how this
works of course so this is it let me now
go back to the report view and by that
we now have a basic understanding of the
interface of the data model however we
still have that query editor right so
that data preparation part let's take a
look at the interface of that Kure
editor in the next video
we now know the interface of the data
model let's see what we can do in the
Cure editor then so this is where we
stopped in the last video we are in the
report view of our GDP data model let's
now open the query editor and see what
the interface looks like there to open
the query editor you simply go to the
home ribbon and select edit queries now
we can maximize that and the first thing
you might note is that this looks kind
of similar to the view we had before in
the data model however there are a lot
of differences the main difference is
that ribbon area appear we have more
ribbons and a lot more functionalities
now we will not talk about those
functionalities right now because in the
next module where we will start our
first real project we will look at a lot
of those functions in detail so for now
the only thing you have to know the
ribbons provide a lot of functionalities
to work with our queries but we'll see
how this works so let's go to the Left
column then we had that few selection in
the data model here we don't have you
the only thing you can change right here
is the selected query now in our case we
only connected one data to that power bi
desktop project but if you connect more
data then you could select all of your
data connections so by that all of your
queries in that view if you then go to
the right column you see that you have
that query settings here you can do two
things mainly the first thing is you can
change the name so you could write table
1 2 press ENTER and you see that the
name changed
so let's undo that this is one
functionality the more important
functionality is this applied steps
table right here this table shows you
each step you applied to your query and
you remember we changed some things and
we can see every change right here now
you cannot only see what you changed you
can also undo your changes by clicking
that X right here we'll see how this
works and how great and help
for that actually is in the next module
so just keep in mind whatever we do is
tracked right here and by saying tracked
right here I also have to add something
if you look into that formula bar and
this is also something new you might
note that we didn't have that in the
data of you or any data model actually
the reason for that is that D query
editor and the actual data model work
with two different formula languages
this is the so-called M language whereas
the data model works with D decks now
we'll talk about the text language in
more detail later on what you have to
know for the moment regarding that M
language in the query editor is that
each of the steps you apply is also
presented in a formula view so you can
see what happens from the code
perspective actually now you could learn
that M language of course no problem but
the curia detour is built in a way that
you have a lot of implemented functions
so normally you don't need to learn that
M language to do the general tasks that
are necessary to shape your data
nevertheless you can see what happens
with the code step by step by looking
into that formula bar so I'll come back
to that from time to time throughout our
data shaping and cleaning in the next
module so that's it we now saw the
interface of the data model in the last
video and we saw the interface of the
query editor in that video now before we
start with our first project and dive
really deep into that career editor
let's take a look at the options and see
if we have to adjust something to make
sure that power bi desktop works the way
we want it to work we'll do that in the
next video
before we start our first course project
let's take a look at the options so this
is still the query editor and we have to
close that to access the options menu so
we go to the home ribbon and press close
and apply now we are back in the data
model and before we change the options
one important note again in the options
we have two option types available
global options and current file options
the global options are set for all power
bi projects the current file options as
the name says actually are only true for
the current file where you set those
options so this means we have to open a
new power bi project which we will then
use for our course project to make sure
that the options are set correctly now
let's do this so we go to the file
ribbon press new now it takes a few
seconds to load the new power bi desktop
instance here it is we can close that
for a moment because we don't import any
data right now and we can now go to file
again go to options and settings here we
see that we have data source settings
which we will not take a look at right
now
and you have options which we will
select and in the options you see that
global and current file options we don't
have to change that global options so we
can directly go to current file and the
data load section here I want to adjust
three things the first thing I want to
adjust is I want to unselect the
automatic data detection this is not
happening because I think this is a bad
option this is a great option actually
but I don't want the data to be detected
automatically I want to do that on our
own so that you see how this works and
that you really get an understanding on
how power bi desktop understands the
data this is why we unselect this one
the same logic is true for the
relationships power bi automatically
detects the relationships that might
exist between the tables in your data
model nevertheless all Lotus works good
we will unselect that to define that
relationships on our own and to
understand the relationships better
so let's unselect that and the last
thing is the background data loading
option this has simple performance
reasons so the Curie editor is faster if
you unselect that so let's do that now
we are fine we can now press ok to
safety options and now we also have to
save that project which should be our
cross project because as we said we have
that option set for the current file
only so if we start our project in a new
file then the options won't be set the
way we did it right now so let's save
that by clicking onto file and save as
and I will call that zero one population
because that's what the data are going
to be about and you can now select a
folder where you want to save the
project and in the next video we will
start working on the project
and with that we reach the end of this
course excerpt I hope you saw that power
bi is a powerful and really awesome tool
and if you're interested in to more
right now then feel free to have a look
at the different videos here in the
channel or as I said in the beginning I
would also be really happy to welcome
you on board of the power bi a complete
introduction course on udemy I have to
say again you can find the link down
there in the description so I hope to
have you on board either here or on
udemy or on both platforms and as always
the only thing I can say right now
thanks a lot for watching and hope to
see you in the next videos bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
