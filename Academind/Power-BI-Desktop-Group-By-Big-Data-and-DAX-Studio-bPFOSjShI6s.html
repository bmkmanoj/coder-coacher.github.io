create a project in power of your
desktop we will work on big data this
time well big data in our case is
actually just a single CSV file with two
columns but each column has more than 77
million rows and by that we have a total
file size of 1.8 gigabytes which is
quite big actually so we will connect
part of your desktop to this source file
then aggregate the data so reduce the
roles basically and finally export that
data as a CSV file so create a new
source file actually now before we start
one quick note I'm aware that normally
you don't do this in power of your
desktop because there are meta tools
available on the market for purposes
like that nevertheless in case you only
can use probably a desktop and you have
to do things like that I just want to
show you that it is possible now having
said that let's start
so this is the new power bi desktop file
I created and they're already connected
to free different source files free
source files I talked about one right
yes but we have data for the New York
City yellow caps in here so in the first
query you can see the data for the
second half of 2014 so we have each day
of the second half we have to sum up the
rights of that day and we have to sum of
the fare paid at that day so we have the
same thing for the first half of 2015
but for the rights only as you can see
right here so this is the second query
that we have another third Kure this is
the one I talked about in the beginning
and this is that big source file and as
you can see we don't have daily data in
here well we have daily data right but
data for each day and each single right
that took place so we have as I said
more than 77 million rows in here and
what we want to do is we want to
aggregate that information to daily data
only and to do this we need a function
in power bi desktop but before we start
let's first format that first column
differently because we only need the
actual date and not the time so to
change this we simply go to the
transform ribbon right here now go to
data type right here and select date now
its power bi already changed the format
when we connected it to the source file
we shouldn't press replace current right
here but add new step so that new
formatting right now if we do this we
can see that we now only have the dates
in that first column but why was that
important well as I said I want to
aggregate the data and to do this we
again go to the transformer band right
here and now select the group by
function right there and this now allows
us to group and by that to aggregate the
data depending on a column that we
select in our case we simply select the
first column so the pickup date time
column right here where we know if that
daily data actually and now each time
power bi finds an equal date in that
column it would simply aggregate that
now this is good but we shouldn't forget
about the second column that fair amount
right here because this should also be
aggregated to each single day but we
have to specify how exactly this
aggregation or that grouping should be
done to do this we simply can go to that
part right here first define a new
column name which would be fair in our
case like this and now the operation
shouldn't be counter OHS it should be
the sum so that we retrieved the sum of
the total fare paid at the corresponding
day so we select sum right here and now
we have to change the column from the
daytime to the fair amount of course and
this is it if we now press ok this is
going to take a while of course because
power bi will now scan through the
entire source file with that one point 8
gigabytes so we'll see each other as
soon as it's finished and this is it
well to be honest this took quite a
while but the great thing is that we
know if the data the way we want it to
be so we now have daily data in that
first column you can see that and in the
second column we have two some of the
fares of the corresponding days so this
is really good but there is one thing
that is not so good right here power bi
is still connected to that initial
source file so that 1.8 gigabyte file so
whenever it scans through the tile again
it will take a long time so we should
avoid that and to do this we will now
simply load this data we have right here
so this queries with that clean tables
into our actual data model and then
export the data out of the data model
into a new CSV file which will then
become our new source file now let's
load the data into the model first by
going to the home ribbon right here and
pressing close and apply like this
again this will take a few minutes so
see you again when this is done and now
this is done and the great thing now is
that if we change to the data view right
here and open our 2015 fares file right
there then you can see that the format
is no good of course but this is
something we don't have to take care
about right now but you can see that we
only have that 181 rows in here in the
data model as you can see right there so
what we can do right now is we can
export the data if the problem is that
we cannot do it with part of your
desktop the good thing is there is a
separate tool to do this let's take a
look at that tool and this tool is
called back studio you can find it right
here and deck studio simply will allow
us to query data out of power bi so out
of the data model that we just saw and
this means we can retrieve the data from
the table that we just created so if we
now press download right here and then
open back studio right there then we can
see that we have that connect window
that opens in that connect window we can
simply select the second option right
here and here we can see that we now
have our power bi file so this group
file let's select that and press connect
and now you can already see right here
that we have our free tables in there
and these are the data of the actual
data model not of the queries or of the
initial source file that's important to
know if we want to get that data now we
simply go to this window right evaluate
like this so we can select it right here
with the arrow keys on a keyboard press
tab now space well and now simply type
taxi and we can already see that we can
now select our fare data right here and
press tab again and if we now press f5
on the keyboard like this then it will
query our data and you can see again
that it Kure the data of the data model
as I just said now we have the data in
here but we want to export it as a CSV
to do this we simply click output over
here and select file like that now we
need to press f5 again to run the query
like this and as you can see we can now
define a name for that new file let's
maybe call it 2015 new just to know that
this is the new CSV file and now change
the text format right here to the CSV
format right there like this and here
you can see our other input files by the
way so we are in the right folder and
now we simply press save like this and
we now save the file so if we now go
back to power bi desktop so here I am in
the data model and open the query editor
like this and now go to our data sources
right here select as you see file so
here I am now again in that source
folder and you can see our 2015 new file
that we just created so let's select
that and press open and this is fine so
we can press ok right here and as you
can see if we now simply change the
format again of the first column by
going through transform ribbon go to
data type and change it to date and add
the new step then we see that we again
have our 181 rows but now with that
connections to that cleaned and small
source file and this will make the work
in our Creator a lot easier right now
and this is it actually this is what I
wanted to show you and as I said in the
beginning power bi desktop is probably
not the best tool to work with such huge
source data however depending on the
performance of the computer you can do
things like that if you want to do it
and in combination with tech studio you
can also easily extract that new
information and by that create cleaned
and smaller source files so this is it
thanks for watching and see you in the
next videos bye bye
maybe some documentaries which would be
some something for us like furs in the
nature yes jong-il feeling yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
