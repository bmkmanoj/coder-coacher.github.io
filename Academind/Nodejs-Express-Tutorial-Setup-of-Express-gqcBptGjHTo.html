you might want to use Express now we're
talking about how to set it up I will
use Express generator to kind of quickly
create my Express project this is an NPM
module which you can install which will
well set us up a default folder
structure with no GS Express already set
up the templating engine use some
example routes so that we can really get
started developing right away and it's
very easy to set up to get started first
once bowl Express generator so I will do
this using sudo and p.m. and on Windows
you don't need sudo in front install
mine's she and and Express generator now
well this will install it and went
pretty fast through because I already
got it and now we're good to go now we
get this Express generator installed and
available now with this generator we are
able to well generate Express projects
so to do this I'm now here in my well in
my know Gia's folder but this is just
where a while kind of collect all new HS
projects for this course here oops in
the root folder in this basics folder so
wherever you want to create your express
project I then type X press this is the
Express generator and then just the name
of the folder of the project in this
case since I'm numbering this this will
be just 0 5 Express first app now this
is already finished now and now it
refreshed and you can see get installer
I created all these folders and files
here this app.js file here it is fuse
for the routes public bin so in a binary
folder - stubble your ww3 file here this
child script file is our server
basically now it has a bit more
information in it but here you can see
where
creating our server and well we're also
listening but does handle through
Express so we no longer have to create
server list 8,000 but it is done through
Express here but and yet in this file
server is created here the port is
configured 3000 I will change this to
8000 right away because 3000 would not
work on my machine I'm using this for a
number for angular so this is the server
file and this is a whole project Express
generator created for us now that I
change this port we're almost ready but
there is one important thing missing we
need to run npm install to install all
the dependencies this dependencies this
project needs they are listed in this
package to chasten file and currently we
don't have this node modules folder
which would hold these dependencies
because express generated that's what
automatically do this so here what we do
is inside this folder so I'm going to CD
into it I run npm install now without g
or anything else just installing
everything specified in this package to
json file here so this might take a
while and well okay now it's finished
and now you will see that we got this
node modules for holding all the
dependencies needed for this project so
with this we're pretty much ready to go
and now we can just run this www file
with no js' so we can either type node
then ww now we got a working server
another way to start our servers running
NPM start in terminal when inside this
well Express project folder here because
in our package the chasing the start
script is set up to do what we did
manually a second I go just run node
ww-well enough of the talking let's have
a look at this reload this page and now
we can see Express welcome to Express
this means it works and it is now set up
successfully the next video will talk a
little bit deeper into all the files
created at the structure we have at hand
see you there bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
