give you a quick overview over the
architecture behind angular 2 or behind
an angular 2 application you can think
of an angular 2 application consisting
of several components which are small
building blocks which make up the app
additionally two components we do have
services which are injected into our
components but I will pick up on that in
a second first let me talk a bit more
about component what does a component a
component is basically a typescript
class which will then be compiled to
classical normal plain old JavaScript
and this typescript class has some
configuration attached to it and
contains the logic of a specific part of
our application now as I said we got
some components in our apps so mention
that our own components and components
then can hold templates which contain
actual HTML as well as Styles where
we're talking about classical CSS now a
component doesn't have to have HTML or
CSS attached to it
there are also components or then called
directives which just holds some logic
which then may be used to render
something to the screen but which is not
directly attached to some template now
these components can work together wire
selectors which are basically custom
HTML tags that is one method to connect
components another one would be wire
routing where we basically switch pages
or parts of the page now if our
components need to for example access
some data
they will not do this directly but
instead they will use a service which is
another angular-specific terminology or
part of the angular philosophy and this
service can then be injected into
classes so that those classes can then
access the methods defined in the
service which for example may get data
from a restful server or from some other
data source
obviously services can not only be used
to fetch data but you do all kinds of
general calculations or fetching that is
not Pacific to one component but may be
used by several components and therefore
has to be injected now don't worry if
you're not sure what I mean by injected
I will explain it to you when when you
come to it but it is very very easy and
it's the way of transferring
dependencies in angular 2 now in a
component obviously we want to render
something to the screen from time to
time because in the end we won our a
user to see something so we got our
template HTML but as you are aware a lot
of the data we display in application is
dynamically created or updates therefore
angular 2 has several ways of binding
data to a few now data binding is
something we'll already come to in the
next video
but we aware that in general angular 2
has unidirectional data binding which
means data only flows in one direction
so basically from the few to the
component or vice versa there is two-way
data binding to
but this is some kind of a special case
I will talk about when we come to it but
the channel will be aware that we got
this unidirectional flow so I think that
is basically enough of the architecture
obviously you could go a lot more into
detail here but I think it's more fun if
we actually get going and write our very
first app which we're gonna do in the
next video see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
