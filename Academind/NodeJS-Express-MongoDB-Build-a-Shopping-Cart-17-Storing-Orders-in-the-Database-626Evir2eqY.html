shopping cart page you can add items to
our shopping cart we can get then go to
it click on checkout enter some dummy
data here of course enter a dummy credit
card number enter well any valid dummy
data down here and then we can buy this
but currently what the spying really
mean it means that we're emptying the
shopping cart opping cart and that we're
making a charge and we can see the
charges here in the stripe dashboard yes
I was making quite a lot of test charges
yesterday and here under payments we can
see all these charges but of course
we're not really storing the order in
the database so we asked the seller of
the items have no chance of actually
shipping the items to the customer we
would have to Wells kind of try to
contact him through the data we got on
our payments and well that is really a
limited data as you see so that's not
really the best experience we're getting
money well that's certainly good but
we're not delivering anything to your
customer and the customer on the uber
ahead of course as he's not locked in
hasn't a way of seeing the orders on
user profile page or anything like that
so that's certainly something we need to
improve too so what are the next steps
required well we want to be able to
actually store orders in the database
when a user makes a charge and we want
to force the user to log in when
actually checking out and we also want
to show the old orders in the user
profile page so let's work on that
step-by-step I'll start with the first
step of storing orders in the database
for that I'll go to my code and in the
models folder I'm going to create a new
model I'll name it order so in the order
dot JS file here that will be a mongoose
model so I'll copy the product model
here for example rename it to order
instead of product and of course also
change to schema
now what should my order have well it
should refer to the user who made the
order so it will have a user field which
will be of type type what of type schema
types object ID because this field will
hold an ID referring to the user object
we created here or we create here this
user model so we'll store an ID and
we'll let Mongoose know that we have a
reference here with the raft key and we
set a reference to the user model so
with that setup we're basically telling
Mongoose hey actually store an ID here
but behind the scenes you should be
aware that this ID links to the users
collection and to the user model so
that's our user we also want to store
the shopping cart which was purchased on
the order right so here this will be off
type object because we will store a
complete card object and we can't do
that in a note or in a Mongo database
really good because it's stored as JSON
anyway so storing objects is really
simple and works great and I want to set
this to be required then I also want to
store the address of the user who made
the purchase because of course we in
theory would need some kind of shipping
address right this should be a string
and also required and thereafter I also
need to name off the personal purchases
and remember we do have input fields for
all these things on our checkout form so
this should also be a string and all to
be required and finally I want to store
the payment ID now what's the payment ID
well it should be a string and required
and the payment ID can be seen on our
stripe dashboard if we go to payments to
see all past payments and then you click
on any payment you see this ID here
that's the payment ID and I want to
store this idea in my orders collection
on each order item because I want to be
able to map an order to and head to a
payment ID here so that I am able to see
I at this payment refers to this order
this will make it very easy for me to
make this connection so I'm storing that
too with that my order model is
successfully set up the next step of
course is to actually well create orders
and store them in the database the place
to do this is in the index chess file in
the routes folder where I make my charge
and here of course in a callback
function below the error check so if I
know that I don't have an error so since
I want to use my order I'm going to
import it here at the top fruity require
keyword import it from the models folder
of course here from the order file
without the file extension whoops like
this and then down here as I said after
this checking if we do have an error I
want to create a new order and save it
to the database so I'll create a new
variable which should be a new order and
I'll pass a JavaScript object as an
argument which should well initialize my
order so I'll have the user here and the
first step of course is I need to get my
user well that's no problem in theory
because later on I will force the user
to be authenticated in order to make a
check out so right now it's possible to
well make a check out anonymous but
later on I will fix this therefore I
will hear fetch the user from my request
and now you might say well the user why
is it stored in the request on the user
field here while Passport does this for
us since I'm using passport in this
application whenever I sign in with
passport passport we'll place this user
object here on the request and therefore
throughout my whole application I can
always access this user object I can
also well accesses to check if the user
is logged in but here I have later on
know that the users
because again I will implement such a
functionality so I'm fetching the user
from my request next I also want to
store the card and I'm already
extracting my card up here right so I
can just set this equal to Cart
then I'll store my address and now this
currently does not work
I want to retrieve it from the post
request which is sent to this checkout
route but if we have a look at the
checkout view here which is where we
issued that post request we do have this
address field but currently doesn't have
a name attribute on it so we would not
be able to retrieve it from the request
in order to be able I'll add this name
attribute to it and well I'll put the
name address on it I'll also give the
name input field up here this name
attribute and I'll name it name well
there are a lot of names but in the end
I just want to be able to retrieve the
value on that input field well on the
name field in my request so I can
retrieve the address on my request body
because remember request body is where
Express stores D well values sent with a
post request so I can retrieve the
address field there since I just created
this and I can retrieve the name exactly
in the same way so request body name so
address and name here of course are the
names I just set up on the view finally
I want to store the payment ID and I can
retrieve that payment ID from my charge
object which gets passed here to the
callback here whoops charge I can simply
access the ID field and how do I know
that the payment ID is stored in an ID
field and not in a field named let's say
payment ID for example well if you have
a look at the stripe documentation you
will see how this response object this
charge object here looks like and then
well there you see that it actually has
this ID field which stores the payment
ID so that's all just reading the
document
here with that my order object is
configured and I can next save it to the
database I will provide a callback here
and this callback of course will either
give me an error or the well result of
this saving operation and what do I want
to do in this callback well I want to
execute all the code I had outside of
this callback here so I'm not checking
for errors here even though well
technically it would be better to kind
off well add if error and then do
something you're like redirect back to
the checkout page something like that
but I'll leave out this for now and just
handle the good case here which should
happen most of the time here on our very
simple application but keep in mind for
real applications you would need to
handle the arrows here so with that I'm
actually saving my order to the database
I'll again tell you that this will only
work if we are locked in so well let's
let's try it I'll restart my server here
go back to my application and reload it
well add something to the shopping cart
click on shopping cart and again I need
to sign in so I'll do this sign in
quickly like this go back to the
shopping cart click on checkout and then
here let's enter some dummy data I'll go
to the strap documentation to fetch this
dummy credit card data here just credit
card number and root here click on buy
now looks good but did it actually save
something to the database
well that's Edward you the MongoDB shell
client here which allows me to have a
look into my database I'll switch to my
shopping database and then here on the
orders collection all we'll find to see
all the orders and as you can see we
actually got a get got an order here
with a user object stored and our card
stored where we see we have well what
Warcraft this is what
but we have the prize and so on so yes
the order is stored we also got the
payment a year and we can verify this
payment ID let's just remember it ends
with we dm7
let's have a look at our stripe account
payments there if I click on the payment
you see the idea right here this is the
payment ID which is the same one as we
saw here so all of that is working but
of course you would get arrows if we
were not logged in so that's certainly
something I need to fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
