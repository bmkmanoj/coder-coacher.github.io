last video where we are able to change
the text of our home link here by adding
an input field and allowing the user to
do this and for that I will even
implement two-way binding which yes we
can do in react chairs too even though
it's not a default so I'll go to my home
component and then I'll add a input
field here next to my button there
should be text and then I want to have
two things happen the first thing is I
want to show the initial value so or the
current value of the name of the link so
initially it should be home and then it
should stay - whatever we changed it to
the second thing I want to achieve is
that I want to well add an event
listener which fetches all the changes
the user makes and stores them so that
we are able to submit the changes
whenever we click this button let's
start with the first thing outputting
the value of D well the current text off
the link I need to pass this value from
my index component therefore from my app
component excuse me here I only pass the
change link reference to my on change
link name method but I also should pass
the initial link name like that and that
of course is just this state home link
this year that's the initial value and
that is the value of whatever we change
it to later on so we're passing this as
props and I'm passing this as props to
my home component and then as input I
can then bind the value property here
oops not after the slash though here
value should be this props initial age
well we'll see if that works the way
wanted to work important when binding to
value which of course is kind of a
built-in property of the input here we
have to use the curly braces because
well I want you well as you learned
before I want to reference something
from my JavaScript class here the props
in this case so if I save this we see 27
here that does not look right
initial age is probably wrong it should
be they call it I called it initial link
name and I'm not getting IDE support
because I didn't add it to my prop types
here that of course should get added and
it should be a string like that but that
if I saved as we see home looks much
better and if I type here well you will
realize that you can type as much as you
want nothing will happen you can't
change this got-damn value why is that
well let's app open the developer tools
and we already see a warning which warns
us about this behavior but I'm ignoring
it for now I'm going to rendering an
able paint flashing and then I'm typing
and as you can see it's constantly
flashing here it's constantly updating
this and now let's have a look at this
warning it tells me that I'm using the
value property on a form field but I
don't have the unchanged handler this
will render a read-only field and the
reason for this is that it will
constantly update the value but it
doesn't listen to any changes I make so
I have one way binding to a form field
which is kind of bad because I'm
ignoring the user input with that so I
would either have to delete the value
here or set up two-way binding by adding
the on change listener which means do
something whenever the input field
changes or put an other word when the
user types something in there so upon on
change I want to call the on handle
change method here for example and
get the event pass to that all these
event handles here always past the
default JavaScript event object so here
I will then execute or I will bind on
handle change without parenthesis but
since I will lead the desk keyword I
will also bring it on a new line and
then use the es6 syntax to don't have to
write bind this so on handle change and
then pass the event which I get passed
automatically by JavaScript or by react
Chasse so the event object is always
available when executing words like this
so now I'm calling this on handle change
with you end being passed to it and then
here I can call this set state and
change the state and of course I want to
change the state of my home link
property here which should now be event
target value the event target of course
is the input field and the value is well
the current value of it with death I can
go back and nothing changed well that is
not really the result you wanted is it
well nothing changed because here we're
binding to this props initial link name
but in the on change handler we're
changing the state so I should probably
bind to this state home link now if I
save this
it's called changed link now I can
change it finally but it's not
reflecting the currently select or yeah
selected text which just displayed in
the header well the reason for that of
course is that home link is set to
change link initially I can set it to
this props initial link name
and remove this just props I do pass
them in a constructor I do get them
passed into the constructor
automatically now we see home and now if
I change just changed and click on this
button we see that we put change there
now if I put change to dad works change
it to home again it works so that we add
quite another important bit to our
application two-way binding and you saw
why it is important in this case here if
you want to display the default value of
our header text and we finish this cross
components communication example where
you saw how to change the state in an
average component from another component
so have two components work with each
other and in this case even two then
change something in a third component
the header component in this case so if
dad you should have an overview over how
you can use react to work with all your
components past data use events use
props use state and maybe you already
got the impression that this can lead to
some problems if you have multiple
components model components you want to
talk to each other maybe even sibling
components nested over multiple layers
of components where you then have to
build kind of a props chain to get you
linked from one component to the other
component and that really can lead to
problems in bigger projects which is why
we'll have a look at redux which helps
us solve this problem an entirely new
serious coming up on this channel or
maybe already available when you will
watch this video because readex will be
the solution to this problem
but redux aside for now these are the
features react.js gives you and these
features are not bad as you see you can
achieve a lot with them you just have to
keep in mind that if you feel kind of
worried by the growing complexity of
that that there is a tool to make it
simpler again and that I will dive into
the tool in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
