imported data we summarize this input
data and we created an analysis sheet
now it's time for the last section of
this Excel workbook the output section
and the output section I'm in charge
let's create the charts in this and the
next three of the series and let's start
with part one right now so we want to
create two yards one charged with the
statistics by region and one charge with
the statistics by country and if you
look at the analysis sheet that we
created in the last video you can see
that we have that information already in
those two tables now we have to create
the charts and as this is the analysis
section I don't want to create the
charts in here but in two separate
sheets so the output sheets and let's
create those two sheets by pressing plus
2 times dragging those two sheets to the
left and naming that first sheet output
regions and the second sheet output
country oops countries like this so now
that we know we want to create the first
chart in that output region cheat we
have to decide on how we get the data
into that chart now we could of course
create the chart and then retrieve the
data from the analysis sheet right here
but I don't want to do that I think it's
better if we have the chart and the
corresponding source data in the same
sheet now we could simply cut the data
from here and paste the table in the
output region sheet or we could simply
create a copy of that table and by copy
I mean a direct link to that table and
this is what i want to do because i want
to keep that a rather complicated
formula right here in the analysis part
and in the output cheat i only want to
have a simple table with a direct link
to that analysis sheet because if
somebody wants to understand how this
was calculated he can never look at that
in the analysis part
now up settings at this let's select
that table and copy it to the output
region sheet into cell b3 because we
have to add something in the first row
I'll show you that in a few seconds now
we press ctrl alt we paste the link and
actually we could also paste the formats
right because this look kind of okay now
we select all of the columns and double
click onto that line and notice it's
good now we have the table so this is
going to be the input for our chart but
we cannot see at the moment what is
displayed right here actually now let's
change this and add the selected the
tistic seeeeee up here and we will
simply link that cell c1 to the analysis
she'd sell d1 like this and if we double
click right here to increase the column
width this is kind of good actually we
can actually go to the home ribbon go to
the front area and create some outside
borders maybe just to make it a little
bit more obvious that there is something
like a special cell in that case the
link to the analysis sheet however this
looks good I only want to add a total
column and a total roll just to have a
little bit more information in the table
so let's write total here and there and
now we simply write some right select
the data press ENTER press and hold
shift and press the right arrow key and
press ctrl R now let's do the same thing
and sell it for write the sum formula
press tab to complete the formula select
those three columns and select the cells
and drag the formula down oh like this
maybe add some formatting to the total
row so make it bold in the home ribbon
and maybe add a top and bottom border
like this and maybe align that to the
right by clicking right here and
changing the color of that total to that
light blue
and the Dwight for an organic bolt so
some formatting topics right here back
to the actual content so now we have
that table and now we could create the
chart and we will do that soon of course
but I want to change one additional
thing because at the moment we didn't
sort the data for the different regions
and I want to change that so let's
simply select the first row go to the
home ribbon and to sort and filter and
apply a filter like this now we want to
filter let's say by the total column so
we simply press on to that arrow next to
the whole column and select from largest
to smallest maybe and now this doesn't
look good right because we have the
total row in here and this shouldn't be
right here this should stay where it was
because we only want to sort the data
for the different regions now let's undo
that and think about a way on how to
change that and to change that let me
just click right here we have to go to
that region part and scroll down because
here we see why we have the problem
because that total Rome is included in
the filter so we have to change the
total row or the formula so that some
formula the total row to another formula
that is not included in that filter
let's not cancel and a formula that can
do this is the subtotal formula now we
want to talk about the subtotal formula
in detail right now the only thing you
have to know at the moment is that the
total formula can do exactly what you
want so we can create a sub with that
formula so the total role but the
formula will then or the row actually
will then not be included in the filter
let's see how this works so I'll go to
cell c11 right here press equal and now
I don't write some but I right sub-total
you can see the second formula right
here now i protect and now you have to
define what should be
calculated so you can calculate the
average count count a and the Sun so
this is the 9 a side note if you select
one online so the value right here this
is also a sum the important thing about
that some is that this sum only
summarizes cells that are not hidden or
that are not grouped so only the visible
cells this is just a side note and this
is a really helpful function of the
subtotal formula nevertheless for our
purposes we don't need that 109 some we
only meet that nine some right here so
let's write 9 write a comma and now
select the sum range just like we do it
before with the normal some formula now
we press ENTER and select cell c11
select all the other cells and press
ctrl R now we have to subtotal formula
in all of the cells of row 11 and if we
now go back to our region filter right
here and scroll down we see that the
total row is not included anymore and
this is because we apply the subtotal
formula and this is what we wanted so if
we now press cancel go to the total
column again and press the arrow right
here and now select from largest to
smallest then we see that this works
perfectly because now we have applied a
sorting without including the total row
and before we create our chart let's
think about what chart type might be the
right one for our purposes now we have
data for three different periods and for
the total period of course and each of
the data is kind of different well at
least two of them so the first two
periods cover six months while the third
period only covers two months so
comparing the total values you can do
that but I think it's better to compare
percentages because of that different
months that are included in each of the
periods so i would say that we create a
column chart which shows us the
percentage share of each region of the
total of each period now to do this
let's select the relevant day
like this and I will exclude the total
row and you will see in a few seconds
why I do this and now we go to the
insert ribbon appear go to the charge
area and if you press on that arrow you
can select the different column chart
now we will select the right column
chart right there let's do this and as
you can see this chart shows us the
different shares of the statistics and
adds it up to one hundred percent and
this is why we don't need that total row
because we have one hundred percent
right here so no need to add that the
problem is that at the moment this chart
does not display the data I want to
heaven here because I want to have the
statistics by period and not by region
let's change this by right-clicking on
to the chart go to select data and now
press switch row and column if you do
this and press ok you can see that we
now have arranged a chart in a way that
we want it to be so we have the
different periods and the different
regions in here now one thing i don't
like about the chart I mean there are
multiple things but one of the things I
don't like to be honest is that we
cannot see the percentages in each
column so we cannot see the percentage
of Asia in column one to change this you
can simply right click on to that part
of the column and now go to add data
labels and add data labels so two times
like this and now you see that we have
data labels but not the ones we want
because we want to see the percentage of
total of Asia and not the absolute value
now what you can do is you can select
the data label by clicking on it now
right clicking it go to format data
labels and now scroll down and change
the number format so you have the
general and if you simply change the two
percentage then you see that this is not
working right because now we have the
absolute value and the percentage so
this does not work now let's undo this
go to general and close it why is not
working well Excel needs an input as
percentage and not this absolute input
that we have right here so an easy way
to change this is if we just create a
second table which shows us this
information but as percentage of total
now let's create the table quickly let's
say right here and we call it region %
let's link the information to the upper
table like this press ENTER and simply
copy the formula by selecting the cells
oops one more and pressing ctrl D now I
select cell b14 press ctrl Z select all
of the rows so here we want to have the
periods press ctrl-v and now we have
that frame of our table let's now fill
it with data so I'm writing equals in
cell G 14 select cell c4 / cell c11 so
the total value of the first period now
I have to fix the row reference of
course because you want to copy that
formula so I have to press f4 to times
like this let's press enter select cell
c 14 sort of cell that contains the
formula press shift and the down arrow
key keep shift press and press the right
arrow key press f2 and ctrl + enter to
copy the formula now we have to change
the number format of dead values so we
can go to the home ribbon go to the
number area and 2 percentage and maybe
add one decimal number by pressing on to
that button right here so this looks
fine let's maybe align that to the right
just some formatting again as you can
see and maybe also change that cell Phil
to a gray maybe like this and format the
total row maybe in bold and again with
those top and bottom borders and then
select the entire table and make it a
little bit smaller regarding the font
just to present it differently than the
initial table now we got that and now we
can change our data labels and here we
again have two ways on how to do this
one way is if we select the data labels
we have right here right click them go
to format data labels again and now we
don't scroll down but we stay in that
label options area an inlet label
options area you have that value from
cells option if you click that then you
can select what data should be displayed
in that data labels now in our case we
want to have the percentage for the
percentage of Asia so if we now simply
select the range of that new table that
we created press right here and press ok
we see oops sorry we see that we have
two percentage and the total value now
to unselect the total value you go back
through label options and unselect value
right here and now you can see that we
only have the data labels with the
percentage share of the total statistics
in that case of use for Asia let's not
close that menu and this would be fine
and we could do the same thing we could
now go to each of the regions right here
at the data label and change the
reference this is one way on how you can
do this but there's another way and this
is if you simply select the entire chart
so I simply left clicked it and now you
see that the chart area is highlighted
right here or not the chart area the
area where the child retrieve
information from and if you now simply
go down right here for instance click
and hold the left mouse button and drag
this frame down to the second table then
you can see that nothing changed but if
you know click on to that Asia region
again and now right click it and add the
data labels you can see that the data
labels are now retrieved from that
second table that we created because the
whole chart now refers to the percentage
off table so this is an easy way on how
to add the day
the labels as you want them to be and
let's now add them for the other regions
by right clicking it at data labels do
the same thing front of America maybe
and maybe out of Africa so for the four
bigger regions basically like this now
this is our chart but to be honest there
are a lot more things I don't like about
the chart and we don't have that country
chart right because this is just the
regional data now let's finish this
chart and add the charts on the country
level in the next video and by the way
this is going to be the last video of
the series so thanks for watching hope
to see you there and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
