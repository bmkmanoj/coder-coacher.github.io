project well I also read a lot of the
comments is a lot of you guys wanted to
see how we can integrate what you see is
what you get editor in our allowable
application so this is what we're going
to do here and this also includes image
upload of course because that is
probably the most interesting thing
about it right but let's start
activating the basics what I want use in
this video is tiny MC because I think
it's a great editor but integration kind
of works similar for most of these
editors so the first thing I will do is
I'll head over to tiny MCE I don't just
click download and then I will simply
get the download button and make sure to
save it in my project so I will stir it
in my source JavaScript vendor folder
here and as you can see I already got it
there so let me get get it exactly the
same way as you have it delete it now
extract this file get rid of the zip
file and well you're it is kind of
multi-layered here of letters that's
fine so this is the project I'll add
this to source control and now I got my
well tiny MC editor imported next thing
is in my welcome to play for you I
already prepared something which you
will paste into it now this is basically
a plain setup which has a form in the
middle here with our hidden session
token field and with a text area and
this text area is what we wanted to
replace with this tiny MCE editor we're
doing this with the killed here at the
bottom and whoa this looks extremely
frightening but
let's start at the top and move through
it so first I'm importing this well tiny
MCE script and well this is just the
path tutors
file here tiny MCE MnDOT yes which we
just imported we're just added here so
this is to pop I add here and then I
well configure it before I then
initialize it this year does it the very
bottom will initialize or our watches
these what you get editor here and it
will initialize it with the
configuration we pass as an argument
now the first thing here is we're
defining a path and this really is just
70 base path or app which comes in
important when we come to things like
image download and well everything this
has to do with accessing files on our
server then so this is where we need to
spell obsolete fingers one the next
one's the selector this is very
important this defines what should be
replaced with this rich featured editor
with this what-you-see-is-what-you-get
editor and we of course want to replace
this text area therefore I'm using this
text area tag here as a selector and you
use the selector you like you use I can
know it from CSS selectors so passing a
name like this will refer to a tag a dot
at the beginning will refer to a class
of course and a half tag to an ID and so
on next thing is which plug-in still we
want to use in this editor because you
can dynamically configure in tiny MCE
which features you want and which you
don't want and this really isn't a
detailed video about configuring tiny
MCE but this is why you do it it just
add well a string an array of strings
which contains all the plugins you want
like for example along printing image
and so
and this how it is then you can
configure the toolbar as well we
displayed so how your options will be
grouped and well in the first place
available in this toolbar and I
recommend checking out description for
more information about this because
there you will find a link to the tiny
MCE documentation which well it's the
best place to get started learning the
configuration of tiny MC well then I'm
disabling relative URLs because I want
to do all the routing absolute from this
path again important for working with
files later on now this part here is
important later when we come to managing
files images and I will explain them the
same is true for this so this whole part
basically what this does is it just
configure is our file manager which we
will later use to well-managed our
uploads our files we have on the server
and so on well then again this started
with the configuration the most
important part being for this part here
the selector now before we actually see
something I'll add one more thing here
or would call this output stoplight dot
PHP file so a new view and I also get
some code for this view it is very
simple and well basically we'll just
output without whichever content were
submitting in our editorial
what-you-see-is-what-you-get intro one
important thing though here where we
output this content variable I'm using
curly braces and then double exclamation
marks why are you doing this and not
well the normal syntax of double curly
braces the reason is using this syntax
here will not escape the HTML code if
there is any so using double exclamation
marks will print or will render the HTML
code instead of printing a test text and
this is of course important because what
we'll do
you see is what you get editor do it
we'll add HTML tags this is how it
styles it and how it face the styling
you apply the editor and how all the
style would be gone and we would have
all these nasty tags as plain text if we
were to use normal calling braces here
which again escape HTML tags and this is
default because normally you don't
really want to output rendered HTML in
your view because this might pose a
security issue so you have to kind of
check that everything is good finder and
in this case well we're just making it
easy as idea it will we find our
merchants rendering it very last thing
before we really see something as
setting up some routes and I already get
my first route which is fine I will just
give it a name of welcome and then I
will add a new route which will be a
post route to the call slash summit will
give a pop slash submit then doesn't
have a function which will take a
request Ave this one here illuminate
HTTP and make sure to get this path
right backslash human a backslash HTTP
backslash request which will of course
hold the improve literal text area we
submit and then here ability to retrieve
the content and save it in a variable so
just access request content here and
then I will return the view out of you
here of course now we'll pass the
content to the content variable I use in
this view and also give this route a
name of submit now every ship everything
should work in the play go to my page
here and reload you can see we got or
what you see is what you get a directory
right out-of-the-box this is all tiny FC
which we plugged in then we told it to
replace this text or
with a tie the MC editor and now we can
use this and type some text type it in
bold as well you might then use some
bullets here and yeah note this image
layer finger won't work as of now we
need to implement some additional
functionality for this to work so only
the basic text formatting works if I now
hit submit you can see well yeah this
was saved and as you can see the
boldness was saved that we got last year
was saved and it's how you use your rich
editor review what you see is what you
get it towards it will basically just
generate HTML behind the scenes and then
send this to your server and door there
of course you have to handle it save it
and in this case then output it with
this double exclamation mark thing to
render render it to screen so this is
the basics of throwing in a WYSIWYG
editor into your lateral application in
the next video we'll come to the very
interesting part of using a file manager
to actually be able to upload and store
well images mainly but any files would
work here
see you next videos what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
