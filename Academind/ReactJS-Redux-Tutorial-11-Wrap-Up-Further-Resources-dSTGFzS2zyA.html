the reactions based in the previous
series about reactions and in this
series we had a look at Redux to make
our application state more manageable to
prepare our application or our project
for bigger applications for more complex
applications you learned how to
configure Redux how to set it up how to
use actions and reducers how to manage
the state and store it how to hookup
react chess and redux how to use
middleware and how to use asynchronous
actions quite a lot of course you can
always go into more detail and if you
want you so well then definitely have a
look at react readex and go to read
access org this will automatically take
you to an article about hooking it up or
if you want to learn more about redux
itself well then just start here and
learn more about redux standalone
without the connection to react which
again and that's important to understand
is not required also as I mentioned for
all these third-party packages for all
the middleware definitely Google their
names and go to their github pages to
learn more about them these are the next
steps and with that I can only invite
you try these things out build more
complex applications play around with it
if you encounter problems search the
official github issues Stack Overflow is
always a great resource Google of course
is to get you to all these resources and
have a look at the official Docs both
for react chess and redux
with that I'll be more than happy to
welcome you in any future video on this
channel have a great day bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
