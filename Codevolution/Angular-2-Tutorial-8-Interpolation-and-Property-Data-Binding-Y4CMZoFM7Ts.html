number eight of the angular 2 series now
if you have a look at or okay before we
proceed I need to mention that I have
removed the code from the previous video
because just style code was taking up a
lot of space on the screen and this is
after all a video about angular 2 and
not CSS so all we have now is hello
world in our app component and Jodoin
tutorials in our code mode component
sorry the tutorials component now if you
have a look here we have hard-coded the
string code more tutorials in our
template what would be better is if you
could have a variable assign it a value
and then bind that variable to our view
which is the template and that is what
we are going to be learning in this
video data binding now a variable is
nothing but a property of our class so
finally let's get into our class so
let's create a property called title and
let's assign it a value so let's say
tutorials from code Mon now when you
save okay so we can bind the variable
value that is tutorials from Jomon into
ab you using double curly braces so
double curly braces and 1 we need to
specify inside is the property so title
now when you save this the browser is
going to reload and it is going to
display the new title so tutorials from
Jomon so what is happening here is
one-way data-binding and this double
curly braces right here is called
interpolation so from our component
property we are binding to the view so
from the property to the view one-way
data-binding
so when you change the property let's
say Joe smart channel and
whenever the property gets updated the
view is also updated with the new value
so it's going to display tutorials from
Jomon channel now another way to specify
binding is to use square brackets for
property binding so let's say we have an
image tag so image now we have the
source attribute and we assign it a
string value let's say h c DB w WR m
pixel so it's our h DB lauren pixel comm
/ 400 by 200 and when we save this it is
going to generate a random image that is
of size 400 by 200 now an angular
however we create a new property called
public let's say image link is equal to
this link over here so copy it and paste
it now in image I saw in angular what we
do is wrap this source property with
square brackets and then assign it a
property so image link and now when you
save it and reload it then we are going
to have a brand new image and the
website still works by angular
application is still working fine but
now what we need to keep in mind is that
we are dealing with the source property
of the image tag and not the attribute
source I mean to say the source
attribute so we are dealing with the
source property and now the source
attribute now if you're confused let me
show you with a quick example and bear
this in mind because this is real
really important going forward so let's
let me create a break break and then let
me create an input tag the type will be
equal to text and let's say the value is
equal to angular now let me save this
when the browser reload we're going to
have the input text box which is not
working value is equal to angular okay
now let me let me save this and we
should have the application working fine
with our input text box okay we have our
input text box with a value angular now
to understand the difference between an
attribute and the probably let me click
on inspect element and in our console
let's go to our console and say dollar
zero dot get attribute and what
attribute are we looking for the source
attribute sorry the value attribute okay
it says angular now dollar zero is
nothing but this input text box so when
we again say dollar zero dot value it is
going to say angular now check this out
let me change it to Joad one and in our
console let me say dollar zero don't get
attribute value whoa what is that
so if you observe here we are not
messing with the app with the source
attribute sorry the value attribute
where we are working on the property of
the tag so when I say dollar zero dot
value
says joy bond but when I get the
attribute it says angular so here what I
mean to say is that we are working with
the source property and not the
attribute the attribute is a one time
initialization but whenever we bind this
property it is the source property so
the property is going to change but not
the attribute and in most of the cases
like the source tag we have a one is to
one mapping between the attribute and
the properties but anyway in data
binding we always always deal with
properties so that's pretty much it for
this video about data binding hope you
guys were able hope you guys understood
the difference between attributes and
properties and how we are binding it to
the property and not the attribute so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
