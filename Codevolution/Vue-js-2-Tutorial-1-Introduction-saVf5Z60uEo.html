to a brand new series on new js2 in this
series we are going to learn the various
concepts in UJS but this video however
is just a quick introduction all right
so what is view J s UJ s is a JavaScript
framework for building web applications
view J's is focused only on the view
layer of your application and hence is
more concerned with building user
interfaces but don't get a wrong
impression view is fully capable of
powering single page applications and
can also be integrated with existing
libraries in your application now you
might wonder why should we use beauties
in particular as opposed to other
popular frameworks like angular or
libraries like react now the first thing
is the simplicity and the ease of use to
get started with view all you need is
familiarity with HTML CSS in JavaScript
if you know those just add a script tag
with a reference to UJS and you can
probably build a small application
within a day now this is unlikely with
some other frameworks like angular for
example which has a pretty steep
learning curve at the beginning the
second thing is performance when it
comes to speed view is a front-runner it
is a lightweight framework with the
production version only a few kilobytes
in size view also implements the virtual
Dom which allows a more efficient update
of the document object model also from a
slightly technical perspective view
separates the UI from the business logic
in your application by making use of
templates which we will learn in this
course view allows us to separate a UI
from our business logic now this might
not seem a great help for a small
application but while building
enterprise scale applications this is a
huge plus point templates amou also a
love for reusable code so it promotes
faster development because of
reasons and many more view has become
popular amongst web developers so if
you're about to learn UJS trust me
you're making a great choice now before
we get started here is the prerequisites
for learning new ge'ez basics of HTML
CSS and JavaScript es2015 or es6 is
optional but if I do use es2015 in any
tutorial I will make sure to explain
that particular code snippet let's get
started in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
