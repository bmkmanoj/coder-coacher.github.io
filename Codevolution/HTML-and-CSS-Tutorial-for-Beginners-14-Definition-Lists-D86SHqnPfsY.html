type of list is the definition list and
whenever you want to specify like an
index or a glossary or any name value
pair you can use definition list now the
definition list tag is kind of different
from the unordered list and the ordered
list tag the definition list is going to
start with DL now instead of using L I
to list an item we use a DT tag to
specify the term so let's say HTML and
then we use a DD tag to specify the
definition so let's say hyper text
markup language and let's create another
term let's say dt and this time CSS and
DD and we can have cascading style
sheets which we are going to be learning
very very soon ok so if I save this and
let me just replace me to try largely
with let's say glossary or not and we
loaded since glossary and then we have
the term which is HTML and the DD which
is it which is kind of a description of
this term so CSS and its description so
what definition list does is kind of
give you like a dictionary where you
have a word and its description now one
final thing about list is that it is
possible to nest one list inside another
so here's what I mean by that let's say
we have an unordered list so UL tag
which we're already learned now let's
have an item so list item let's say HTML
now under this week within the unordered
list it is possible to specify an
ordered list so let's have an ordered
list and this time the order list is
going to have a list item tag which is
hyper and then another one which is
hyper text and then another item which
says markup and finally hypertext markup
language nope once again we close the
art ordered list and we can have another
item which is off the unordered list
excuse me and then we can have something
like let's say CSS now under this we can
have another or list and we can have a
item that says cascading on your item
style one more item with cascading style
sheets so if we have if you are going to
save this then refresh it so here's what
we get the output so if you go back to
your code we say that the unordered list
we have HTML and CSS as our items so we
have HTML and CSS now underneath HTML we
have an ordered list of hypertext markup
language so with one two three four an
ordered list is going to be displayed
with hypertext markup language and
similarly for cascading style sheets now
it is possible to nest any level of
lists and you can have an ordered list
inside an unordered list or an unordered
list inside an ordered list and all
sorts of permutations anyway I hope you
have a good understanding of what lists
are and how to use them
so thank you guys for watching don't
