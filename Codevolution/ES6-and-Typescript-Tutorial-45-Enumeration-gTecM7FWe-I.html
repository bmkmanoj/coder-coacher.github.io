type so let's assume we have to define a
variable whose value will represent the
color of your eyes now some of the
meaningful values can be brown black or
blue so to define those values we can
use an enum type now enumerations are
simply used to give friendlier names to
numeric values and create a specific
type for a variable so to declare the
innum type we start off by using the
enum keyword so enum and this is
followed by name for the enum type so
now let's have I color as eye color as
our name and this is followed by curly
braces that contains the list of
possible values so we can have brown or
black or blue now this declaration will
assign a numeric value of zero one and
two to brown black and blue now we can
also specifically assign the numeric
values so we can have brown is equal to
one and this is going to change black is
equal to two and blue is equal to three
or we can even have black as equal to
five and blue is equal to ten it doesn't
really matter if I hover over brown it
says I colored Brown is equal to one
black is equal to five and blue is equal
to ten now we can declare a variable
that will be of this particular item
type so now I want to create available
my eye color and this is going to be
equal to I color dot to access the
individual values so I'm going to use
Brown so my eye color is brown color so
when I save this and try to log to the
console my eye color let's save this and
it shows one which is the numeric value
that brown represent
so Brown is a user-friendly name for
this numeric value of one now if I want
the user-friendly name then what we can
do is I'm just going to copy this and
index this eye color enum type with my
eye color so eye color and within square
brackets my eye color so when I save
this it's going to say brown so that is
it about the enum type the innum type is
used to create a custom type where we
can specify a list of values that
available can hold and the enum type is
basically so that we can have a
user-friendly value for a particular
numeric value so one is brown v as black
10 is blue and we can assign to
variables this particular type so that's
pretty much it for this video thank you
guys for watching and don't really
