to learn how to animate an element to
enter and leave and for that we first
need to learn about two special states
in angular animations the first one is
the wildcard state now the wildcard
state is going to match any animation
state so when you want to apply styles
regardless of which state that
particular element is in then you can
make use of the wildcard state now this
state is not a necessity for enter and
leave animations but it is much easier
to understand understand them with the
help of wildcard state so we'll be using
that in our example now the second one
is the wide state now this state applies
to any element that is not present in
the view so this state is going to be
necessary to define enter and leave
animations and here's how you can make
use of these two states now to define an
entire animation we need to specify a
transition from a wide state to a
wildcard state so from a state when the
element is not in and not in the view to
any state when the element is in the
view similarly to define a leave
animation we specify a transition from a
state in the view so a wild-card state
to a state that is not in the view so
wide state alright let's look at an
example and that should make things more
concrete for you so right now we just
have angular animations displayed from
our application and if you head over to
Visual Studio code we just have
interpolation from this title property
so that is all we have in our app
component so first thing we have to do
is create a div element that we are
going to animate so div and then close
the div tag and over here I'm going to
use a structural directive
star ng F and this I'm going to assign
it to show Dib all right and then we are
going to animate this element so let's
also add at
trigger so let's call this animation
fly-in out all right and then we'll just
have a simple text as the content for
this div tag so fly-in out alright so
now we have the element that we want to
animate and we will be using the ng-if
directive to show or hide this div
element but rather than that happening
instantaneously we are going to animate
it so that it appears to be entering or
leaving the view so now let's go ahead
and define this animation so we're here
in the animations metadata I'm going to
add a trigger and what is the trigger
fly-in out and then we are going to
define the transitions now the first
transition is going to be the enter
transition so from a state that is
outside the view so wide state to any
state within the view so why is the card
state so this is the enter animation so
now over here I'm going to specify first
a style so initially we want the element
to appear from the left so we are going
to have transform and then trance late X
by minus 100% so basically if let's say
okay let me just complete the code and
then I can explain to you how this
animation works and I'm going to animate
this for one second
all right similarly we are going to have
a second transition so transition and
this time this is going to be the leave
animation so from any state in the view
so wild card state to a state outside
the view so wide state so we want to
leave from the view so over here again
we are going to specify an animate
function this time it's going to be one
second and it is going to be style and
that we wanted to move away from
the screen to the right so transform
translate X 100% all right now we can
add a button that is going to toggle the
value of show div between true and false
so we're here let's add that button so
button button and then over here there's
going to say toggle div and then over
here we are going to listen to the click
event on this button so event binding
and we are going to assign toggle div as
the handler now let's come back to our
app component class and declare that
show the property so she'll do is of
type boolean and it is going to be
initially true so that the element is
going to be on the screen next we are
going to define the toggle div function
so toggle div this dot show though is
equal to this doll so div is it true if
it is true then make it false if not
make it true all right so that should
toggle and we should have everything in
place and let me explain the animation
now so initially suppose all right so we
have this fly-in out all right so
initially for this to enter the screen
it should be at a position outside the
screen to the left and hence initially
we are assigning a style translate X a
negative percentage so basically it is
going to be displaced towards the left
of its original position so from
somewhere from the left it is going to
enter and then it is going to stay right
here and then when we want it to leave
the screen we are going to animate it
for one second and then we are going to
say while this animation or this
transition is happening translate to the
right by Han
percent so if this div tag is taking up
the entire screen it is going to move to
the right by 100 percent and that is
going to create the effect of the
element moving out of the screen so now
let me just save this alright so now
when I click on toggle div you can see
that it is exiting from the screen and
if I click on toggle dip again
watch closely from the left there you go
it entered the screen so exit and enter
and these two transitions are pretty
common
according to angular so this set they
decided to give it an alias so you can
just name it as enter and leave instead
of specifying the different states and
this is still going to work as expected
so let's wait for it to reload so there
you go it entered I'm going to click
it's going to exit I'm going to click
again it's going to enter from the left
then exit to the right so that is how
you animate exit or enter and exit
animations and this might come in handy
especially when you are going to use
routing for example when you navigate
from one component to the other you want
the current component to maybe fly away
from the screen and the new component to
fly into the screen so this is pretty
useful so thank you guys for watching do
it freely subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
