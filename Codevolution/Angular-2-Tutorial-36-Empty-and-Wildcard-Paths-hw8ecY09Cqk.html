introduce two new pads that are going to
be of use in our application so you
might think that our application works
perfectly fine right now but if I open
the console you can see that we do in
fact have an error and the error is
basically angular telling us hey you
have told me that I need to show the
department list component four slash
department and employ list component
four slash employees in the URL but when
you specify nothing and it's just an
empty string what should I do
so I don't know about that I'm just
going to throw you an error that you can
have a look in the console so to solve
this error we need to configure what is
known as an empty path so let's go ahead
and do that in our app routing module ts
file so we're here and the list of route
I'm going to add another configuration
and this time the path is going to be an
empty path and the component that I'm
going to show is a new one that I've
created this is called home component
and this home component also needs to be
imported and I also need to include this
and the list of routing components so
let me copy this and paste it over here
and let me also quickly show you what
the home component does so it is just an
h3 tag that says welcome to angular
routing so let's save this and check if
it works and there you go our
application has been reloaded and if you
have a look at the console there are no
more errors and when you navigate to
localhost 3000 this home component is
displayed so welcome to angular routing
is displayed in the router outlet
so this empty path is like a default
path now I can change this to department
list component so that we change home
component to department list component
and when you head over to the browser by
default
it is going to be the department list
component and also if you have a look at
the URL it is empty
so if you want to display a component
without specifying or extending the URL
then you can go ahead with this empty
pad this right here now the second
useful pad is the wild-card pad so first
let me configure it and then explain to
you what it does so underneath this
department detail component pad I'm
going to add a new pad pad and within
the pad I'm going to specify two stars
and the component is again a new
component component is going to be a new
component that I have specified so page
not found component now I also need to
import this so let me import page not
found component and this I'm going to
import it from dot slash page not found
dot component and let me also go ahead
and clued this in our routing component
list and let me also quick let me also
quickly show you what this does so the
page not phone component is again just
an HD tag that says page not found so
let me go back here now there are two
points that I need to explain the first
is that this wildcard path is going to
match any URL that is entered and the
second point is that angular matches the
URL to the configured route from the top
so if you put the two points together
you can say that angular will display
this page
not found component only if none of
these previous pads are matched with the
URL so let's try this out I'm going to
save this and head over to the browser
and I'm going to enter the URL slash
random and there you go
we have the page not found component
displayed why because this pad slash
random doesn't match any of our pads
that are previously configured now let's
have a look at what happens when I move
this to the top of the list so I'm going
to move the wild-card pad over here to
the very beginning and let's save this
so now what happens let the application
reload and I'm going to enter just the
blank URL and it says page not found and
we're going to click on Department it
goes to slash departments but it is
still page not found
I go to employees it is still page not
found so what happens is any URL that
enter gets matched with this pad so the
component that has to be displayed is
this page not found component so what I
mean to say is anytime you specify your
list of routes make sure that the more
specific routes are mentioned at the
beginning and the less specific ones for
example the wild-card pad gets specified
at the very bottom of the list so that's
pretty much about the empty path and the
wild-card path thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
