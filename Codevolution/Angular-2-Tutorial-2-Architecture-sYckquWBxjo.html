are going to go through in brief the
building blocks of an angular
application so the first one is a module
now angular applications are modular in
nature therefore our application is just
a collection of many individual modules
but what exactly is a module module is
just a block of code that is created for
a specific purpose because of this each
module exports something like a value or
a function or a class that the other
modules can import and make use of so we
create a module which is nothing but
code we export it from that module if
you want to use that code we import it
in the other module and yep just use it
in fact the angular framework itself is
the collection of library modules the
next component or the next building
block is called a component now in the
previous slide we saw that we have
modules which have a block of code
within them now this is nothing but a
component a component is usually a
JavaScript class with some metadata
attached to it
now this metadata is going to tell us
how to process this particular class for
example in our metadata we might have
the HTML which is going to be the view
for our component and in our class we
can have the logic that is going to
influence the particular view let's say
we have a web page where we have a
navigation bar a left sidebar or right
sidebar and a main content then we are
going to create a component for each one
of these individual functionality and in
our angular applications we will have at
least one component called the root
component and all the other components
are going to fall under this root
component this way our entire
application is broken down into easily
manageable views or components to say so
if we have a sample piece of code to
look at we are going to have a body
book the body tag and within the body
tag we are going to have the root
element or the root component now this
component is nothing but a custom HTML
tag to look for example and within the
root component we are going to have all
other components living inside the
components are very very important and
we will be learning about them in detail
in the future videos next up we have
directives now a directive is nothing
but some sort of an instruction that is
present in the HTML which is going to
allow us to modify the Dom or extended
or extend its behavior now a component
is also a directive but a component does
not live inside other HTML elements the
kind of other HTML elements themselves
so again we are going to be learning
about directives and the later videos
but again a director is nothing but
submitted data and a class next we the
next thing we need to learn about is
services ok ok so now if our component
wants to get some data from a server
then it might have a function to do so
if another components want if another
component wants to get get the data then
the component also has the same function
now to avoid the duplication and have a
separation of concerns we make use of a
service now a service is nothing but a
class that gets the data or
configurations from the server and then
after doing so we inject the service to
sorry with that we inject the service to
the two components now when we inject
that these two components can make use
of the service so any logic that is not
related to the view will be residing
inside a service now finally we have
routers which is which are responsible
for navigation so a router based on the
URL will decide which view component has
to be presented to the user so that's
that pretty much sums up the
architecture of angular 2 and in the
next video let us see what is the
initial requirements and setup that is
needed to get started with building our
very first angular application so thank
you guys for watching don't forget to
