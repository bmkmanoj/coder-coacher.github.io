how to delete documents from a
collection now the first thing is as
usual TV not every wise dot find dark
pretty now we have a documents employee
number one - employee number eight now
let us see how to delete a particular
document so let us say employee number
two now with the command to delete a
document is DB dot employee the
collection name don't remove and now we
will takes a selection criteria as a
parameter so we are going to be using
the object ID which is unique as a
selection criteria you copy that and
paste it so we are selecting the object
ID for employee number two and when we
execute the command
it says remove one so one document has
been removed now when we go back to find
we see that employee number one and then
employee number three employee number
two has been deleted now the remote
command also takes an optional second
parameter called just one flag so when
this is set to one it meets that delete
only one document irrespective of how
many documents are matching the
selection criteria for example let us
say we have we want to delete everyone
who has a skill and MongoDB all
employees so the selection criteria is
skill as well go TV now we have a total
of ten point number one MongoDB employee
number six one woody be an employee
number seven one would it be now when we
run this
only one document is removed because of
the just one flag so if you go back to
find it we see that employee number one
has been deleted just the first document
divides this criteria now document
number six and document number seven
however with Whanganui skill still
remain in the collection now if we go
ahead and remove just one flag and
execute control sure and so we have
removed two more documents from the
collection now when we go back to find
it we see the document nor five is
present in document number eight is
present document number six and seven
which had a skill and MongoDB are now
deleted now that's how you go with
delete deleting documents you use the
remove command and you specify a
selection criteria and an optional just
one flag thank you for watching don't
forget to hit the subscribe button I'll
see you the next really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
