when creating a context menu is that it
needs to run in the background and not
when we click on the pop-up HTML in the
toolbar and we need the context menu to
appear only when we select some number
on the webpage therefore what we need is
an event page and not a background page
so let's see how to create a context
menu now to let the extension know that
we are using an event page we first need
to specify that in the manifest file so
over here below options I'm going to say
background this is going to be an object
we're going to have a property called
scripts and this is going to for now be
an array that contains a single script
and that is going to be even pages and
the second property is persistent and
this basically indicates whether we are
specifying a background page or an event
page if persistent is false then it's an
event page now the last thing to do in
the manifest file is to request for
permissions for the context menu so
we're here context menu so now we can go
ahead and create this even pages so new
file event page Dargis all right now we
are going to first create a context menu
item so this is going to be an object
context menu item now we need to specify
an ID so this is going to be let's say
spend money and then we are also going
to have to specify a title and this is
basically what appears when we
right-click on the webpage so let's call
this spend money as well
so but this time it capital it with
uppercases spend money and then finally
we specify the contexts where this is
supposed to appear for now we are going
to have to make this up here only when
the user selects something on the
webpage so the context is selection you
can also have different content
like when there is a click on an image
or there is a video and for more of
these contexts I would recommend you to
go through the chrome developer web page
alright now that we have this object we
can use a method chrome dot context menu
menus dot create and we specify this
object so let me just copy this and
paste it so now let's save this save the
manifest let's reload our extension
because we change the manifest
so reload when trying to install
permission context menu is not known
okay context menus let's save this and
reload this and now let's go over here
and let me select an integer value so
let's say 28 and when I right click I
get the spend money context menu so you
see this this was not there before so of
course this doesn't do anything right
now but what we ideally want that what
we ideally want is when we click on
spend money this 28 needs to be updated
with this total spent so let's do that
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
