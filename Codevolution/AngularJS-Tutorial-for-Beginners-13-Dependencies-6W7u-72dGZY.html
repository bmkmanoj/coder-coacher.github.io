code is by using dependencies suppose we
have a product page where we have a list
of products that we are selling and a
review page where the user posts a
review we might be creating a lot of
controllers and a lot of directives for
that purpose this will lead to sort of
cluttering in an app dot J's code and
functionality which we do not want
imagine going through hundreds of
directives and not knowing for which
page the directive belongs to so what
we're going to do is we're going to
reorganize our code the first thing is
create a new file and copy the entire
app yes but this time really my app to
review app so we have created ok
reviewed ah yes so what we have done is
created a new module in our angular
application called review app your app
dot yes we're going to delete the
controller and the director and we're
going to specify a dependency now
remember this empty area that we had
specified in a very first tutorial now
this is for the list of dependencies and
in our case we're going to specify
review now what we mean to say is that
we have a module called app but this
module app is going to depend on the
working of another module called review
app by doing so we can minimize the code
in our app - and we can have several
modules just like review yes such as
product yes you can have a dependency on
another module as well this is just a
good way of coding practice so the last
thing we're going to do is go back to
our index dot HTML and include the
script the script type is text slash
JavaScript and so this is equal to
you dodge ass go ahead and save
index.htm save user and fill save up yes
they've reviewed yes go back to your
browser when you reload okay let me just
check reviewed our yes I pickles review
app I'm sorry so this is review app save
it go back to your browser
reloaded now we have nothing changed
from what we had but we have just
reorganized our code and made it much
more that what can we save much more
clean I mean I think we are in a good
position I think we can move forward to
creating a very first angular
application if you guys have any more
topics that you want to know about
please leave a comment I'll try to make
video especially for those and anyway
thank you for watching don't forget to
subscribe I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
