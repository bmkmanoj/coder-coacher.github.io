number 26 now in es2015 there are two
types of exports named and default in
this video let us focus on named exports
now we have two files module 8 HS and
Morabito GS now let's head over to
module bjs and create a new variable so
let F name is equal to Chandler
now let's say we want to export this
variable F name so that it can be used
in other modules so for that we just
need to use the export keyword so add
export at the beginning of the statement
so now our variable F name is ready to
be accessed in other modules so how do
we import that over to module HS so to
import variables we use the keyword
import followed by name of the variable
so of F name within curly braces and
from where are we importing it from a
file called module P dot shares in the
current directory so dot and slash for
the current directory now when we try to
log to the console F name let's save
this and head over to the browser there
you go Chandler so we have created a
variable F name equals Chandler in
module B and importing it into module a
and we have displayed it on the log so
imports and exports how are how modules
communicate now let's create another
variable export let L name is equal to
Bing now to import this we can just
specify with the comma the name of the
variable so LM over here in console log
let's switch to backticks
and let's switch this $2 F name and
dollar he'll name so when I saved this
head over to the browser and we have
Chandler Bing now if you don't remember
or recognizes backticks and the dollar
interpolation please check my tutorial
on string templates so what have you
done we have created two new variables F
name L name exported them from module B
imported them in module 8 and then log
them onto the console now let's say we
have 10 variables to export in such a
case this export keyword can be replaced
from every sentence and we can just have
one export so what we can do is export
followed by the list of variables to be
exported so F name how lame so if we had
10 variables we just would specify all
10 variables separated by a comma so now
when we export it and import it
everything else remains the same
Chandler pane so nothing changed so
that's another way to export your
variables you can either do it in the
same line or you can have a single
export at the end specifying the list of
variables so the next point about
importing is that we can specify an
alias so over here
def name I can see as F and L name as L
so providing an alias for fname and
lname as FN l but now let me show you
what happens when I save this so that's
we have an error F name is not defined
and same is the case with L name so when
you use an alias for an import you must
use that alias
now we change this to F and change this
to L so now let's save this there you go
Chandler Bing so a point about import
import statement we can provide alias
for imports but the only condition is
that we must use the alias name we
cannot use the original name now the
next point about import our module
imports or hoisted so over here let's
add a new let's just log to the console
module be loaded and we need to be
within codes all right
now let's go back to module a and just
before import let's add log statement
that's going to say module a log one and
let's add another log module a log 2 so
now let's save this and head over to the
console and it says module be loaded
module a log 1 module a log 2 and then
Chandler Bing so let's try to understand
what happened
our very first statement more you'll be
loaded was logged in module B cheers so
we have a single log statement you can
just ignore everything else for now we
have module be loaded and when module a
is loaded we have first the log
statement for module a log 1 and then
the import statement so over here we
should have log for the that the module
B is loaded so but what happened in the
actual log is that module B look loaded
was hoisted to the top so whenever you
have an import statement it is always
going to be to be hoisted to the top so
this import is going to go above this
module a log 1 so that is why we have
more you'll be loaded
and then Mario a log one module a log
two together and then Chandler bring of
course so there is something to be kept
in your mind module a sorry import
statement are hoisted and finally all I
want to discuss is that imports are
read-only so over here we have let F
name let L name and let's go back to
module a I'm going to remove the alias
so that it makes it simpler to
understand so L name and replace this F
name and L name so we have imported
fname and okay let me just remove this
as well so we have imported first name
and last name now let's try to change
first name to Ross so when we save this
we get an error so what the error
basically says is that you cannot change
something that you have imported so
imports are read-only so F name and L
name can be imported but can never be
changed but what you can change is the
properties of objects so let go BJ is
equal to an object I am just going to
create a property and give it a name
let's say Joey
now and let's also export obj now head
over here import obj now I can change
obj dot name to Ross and console.log but
we J dot name so let's save this so
model be loaded and the name has been
changed from Joey to Ross so Joey was
the original name and we were able to
change it to Ross so those are some
things that I wanted to cover
named export thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
