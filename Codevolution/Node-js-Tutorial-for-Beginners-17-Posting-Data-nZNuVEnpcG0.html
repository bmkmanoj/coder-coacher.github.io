finish the last piece of our application
which is posting a review and then
displaying the review now in no chairs
it is possible deserved data in small
chunks said that the process can be done
in a non-blocking fashion for that
reason we're going to be making use of
two events the first one is the data
event which signals that a new chunk of
data has arrived and the second one is
the end event which signals that all the
data chunks have been received so in a
server module we need to be listening to
these two events so go to your server
OGS file and create a new variable
called review data and this is going to
hold the review that was submitted by
the user then let us set the encoding
format to be utf-8 for the request data
so request dot set encoding and it is
going to be utf-8 then we need to be
listening to the two events so request
dot add listener listener the first
event is our data event and when there
is a data event it means that a chunk of
data has arrived so we're going to pass
the parameter chunk and within the chunk
within the function we are going to
accumulate this chunk into a review data
variable so review data is equal to
sorry is plus equal to chunk now as and
when the chunk arrives it is going to
get added up and distributed a variable
now the second event is request dot add
listener and this time the event is
going to be end which means that all the
chunks of data have been received
now in that case we can call our out
function so cut this route function and
then paste it here and include the
review data variable so we mean to say
that we are going to start routing the
request only when this particular
reviewed data has been filled with all
the chunks of data so let's go to a
router ojs and include this new
parameter so review data and we need to
pass this review data to our handlers so
you put a comma and then review data and
now we have to go to your handlers
Dodgers or the handler module and in a
review function we need to specify
response and then the review data now in
order to be able to handle this review
data we need a new module called the
query string module so variable query
string is equal to require query string
now this is a core module so we don't
need the dot and slash now within a
review function we are going to say
function review is going to have a
response dot write head and it says let
me just copy this sorry let me just copy
this well I am lazy right we are going
to have text slash but playing this time
and then we are going to be writing
response dot right we are going to be
displaying the reviews so your review is
and then we need to use the query string
modules parse method and we are going to
be passing the review data and text
then we can just end our response a
sponsored end now let's go ahead and
save all our files
let's open command prompt and type node
apt are Jess and the server has started
if we refresh it and type this is my
first high rest review rebuild so when
we submit our text then we go into the
review page and it says your review is
this is my fire rest rebuild so that's
how we have created our application by
making use of a server the router and
the handler and the abscess which is
going to be the entry point for our
application so thank you guys for
watching and for the next few videos I'm
going to be copying some of the videos
from my MongoDB series so that there's a
good understanding of how to work with
nodejs and MongoDB and after that not
really sure what the tutorial series is
going to be about but anyway thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you in
the next video and don't forget
subscribe don't forget to subscribe see
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
