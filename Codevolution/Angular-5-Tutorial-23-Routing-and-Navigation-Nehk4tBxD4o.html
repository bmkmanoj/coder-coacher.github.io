learning about routing and navigation in
angular now any angular application you
build is going to have multiple
components each component with its own
mu so we need a way to navigate between
the different views as and when the user
performs some action and for this
purpose we make use of angular's router
I want to mention here that even though
we did learn about services I am NOT
going to use services while explaining
the different concepts of crowding I
want to focus on routing and routing
alone so we will be using hard coded
data for our examples and there is a lot
to learn about angular sprouter so let's
learn one concept at a time
in this video we are going to learn how
to navigate between two different views
with button clicks so when the user
navigates to the URL localhost colon
4200 we display a title that says
routing and navigation and below the
title we are going to have two buttons
the first one says departments the
second says employees if we navigate to
the URL localhost colon 4200 slash
departments or click on the departments
button we display a list of departments
if we navigate to the URL localhost
colon 4200 slash employees or click on
the employees button we display a list
of employees so based on the URL or
which button the user clicks we navigate
to the appropriate view now to implement
this requirement here are the steps
first we generate a new project using
angular CLI
with the routing option second step we
generate the department list component
and employee list component these are
the components we want to display in the
view
third step we configure the routes for
our application this will allow us to
navigate to the routes from the URL
third step we add buttons and use
directives to navigate to the configured
roads so let's begin with step one
generating a new application I'm going
to go back to visual studio code and I
am in the angular project folder open
the integrated terminal and type the
command in G new followed by the project
name I'm going to call this project
routing demo and since this is an
application with routing we also include
the routing option - - routing alright
so the project was successfully created
now we might not always generate a new
application with the routing option we
might want to add routing to our
existing application as well so let me
go over what the routing option does and
you can replicate the exact same code in
your existing application as well now
the first thing you need to include is
the base tag in your index dot HTML file
so in the source folder open index dot
HTML and as a child to the head tag add
a base tag and set the value of hrf
attribute to a forward slash this is
required so that the application knows
how to construct the URLs while
navigating next in the app folder create
a new file app - routing dot module dot
PS this file contains the routing module
for our application this is where we
configure the different routes we will
come back to this in a bit finally
import a protic module in app module so
in AB dot module dirtiest import a
protic module and add it to the imports
array so that it is part of the routing
demo application alright so that is our
first step generate a new angular
application
with the routing option the second step
is to generate the department list and
employee list components that we will be
navigating to so in the terminal
navigate inside the project folder see
the routing demo run the command ng g4
generate C for component department -
list
- IT for inline template - is for inline
style
similarly ng g4 generate C for component
employee - list
- IT for inline template - is for inline
style so that is our second step
generating the two components the third
step is to configure the routes for the
application and we do that in the app
routing module so we have a constant
route which is strongly typed - routes
from the router package here we define
all possible routes for our application
and each route is nothing but an object
the object contains a path which is
reflected in the URL and the component
to be rendered when we navigate to that
corresponding path now we need to
configure two routes for our application
the first one is Department and the
second one is employees so in the first
route enter the path as department and
in the second route and that the path as
employees if we navigate to Department
we need to display the department list
component to specify the component
property similarly if we navigate to
employees we need to display the
employee list component make sure to
import the two components as well but by
doing so we are duplicating the import
statements we have the same import
statements in both a protic module and
app module so what I like to do is
create an array of all the routing
components export it and then import it
in the
module so I'm going to create a new
constant and exported export Const
routing component and this is going to
be equal to an array of the two
components Department list component and
employee list component and then in the
app module we imported so import a
protic module and routing components
from a browsing dot module type script
file I'm gonna remove the two import
statements and in the declarations array
I'm going to replace them with the
routing components so now any time we
add a new component for routing you just
have to specify in the routing module so
this is a good practice and I recommend
you do the same all right
the routes have been configured if you
navigate to localhost 4200 slash
department we display the department
list component and localhost 4200 slash
employees we display the employee list
component but hang on how are we
specifying where these components have
to be displayed the answer is the router
outlet directive so if we take a look at
app component HTML at the very bottom
you see this directive router outlet
this directive is available from the
router package and it marks where the
router displays a view so you can say
that the router view goes here now let
me also simplify the app component HTML
we don't need these unwanted HTML markup
so I'm going to remove it remove the h2
tag as well remove the image and instead
of welcome to title our title is going
to be routing and navigation all right
now our application is ready to be
tested let's save this and run the
application npm start open your browser
and navigate to localhost colon 4200 and
you should be able to see routing and
navigation if I change the URL to slash
depart
you can see the department list
component being displayed and if I
change the URL to slash employees you
can see that the employee list component
being displayed so routing is working as
expected
based on the URL we navigate to the
corresponding component is displayed but
we cannot expect the user to navigate to
the components by typing out the URL so
let's add some buttons to navigate
between these views let's go back to app
component HTML I'm gonna add a nav tag
and within the nav tag two anchor tags
department employees to make routing
possible with these anchor tags we use
two special directives from the router
package the first one is the router link
directive which specifies the path to
which we want to navigate to so when we
click on the department's button we want
to navigate to the departments tab
similarly when we click on the employees
button we navigate to the employees path
the second directive is the router link
active directive this directive lets you
specify one or more CSS classes that
will be applied when the corresponding
router link is active or in simpler
terms you click on the anchor tag and
the class specified over here gets
applied to the anchor tag for our
example I'm going to use the active
class if you take a look at Stiles dot
CSS you can see that for the active
class we just change the color and the
code is available on my github repo so
don't worry about the rest of the
classes here and let me add the
directive to the employees button as
well now let's save this and take a look
at the browser so localhost 42-hundred
and we see the title routing
and navigation and the two buttons
Department and employees if I click on
Department the URL changes and the
Department list component is displayed
you can also see that the button font
color is changed because the active
class is now applied to this anchor tag
if I click on employees the URL changes
to slash employees and the employee list
component is displayed the active class
is now applied to this anchor tag and
hence you see the change in font color
so we have implemented basic routing in
our angular application let me quickly
remind you of the steps in index dot
HTML at the base tag and set href to a
forward slash in the aprotic module
configure the routes each route has a
path and the corresponding component
once you have the routes defined pass it
as an argument to the for route method
of the router module export the aprotic
module and the routing components
imported in the app module and included
in the imports array and the
declarations array with this setup you
can navigate to the particular route by
directly typing in the URL to navigate
via buttons use the router link
directive and specify the path to change
the style of the active route use the
router link active directive alright so
that is how you navigate between
different views using button clicks
