nine and this video we are going to be
learning about tables now whenever we
want to arrange data like text or images
or even links and rows and columns then
we make use of HTML tables so let's
create a table for the cost of the
French TV series now we will be creating
something like this we have a table with
two rows to columns and seven rows now
to create a table will be using a table
tag and each row and the table is
created using a TR tag something like
table row and the very first row maybe a
heading row so if you want to specify
the column as a heading you can use the
th tag and the remaining rows since they
contain data we are going to be using
the TD tag to specify the data so let's
get started with coding and understand
this better now let's say we have our
description of our trends and then we
have more information and let's create
the table underneath so to create a
table will be making use of the table
tag and as we saw we are going to have
to create rows in the table so each row
in the table is created by a TR tag and
this row is going to contain the columns
so in our example each row had two
columns and the very first row is going
to contain the heading for that column
so we are going to have a th stag and a
second th stag so within our first eh
stag we can have first name and within
the second one we can have last name
now similarly we have six rows under
this heading which are the actual cast
names of the cost so we'll be creating
another row with TR tag and we are going
to have TD as the tag for the data table
data the first one is rachel green and
then close the DD deck similarly we are
going to copy this and paste it sorry
this has to be just Rachel which is the
first name and green which is the last
name similarly we have 65 other
characters so I'm going to just quickly
copy paste this go two three four five
and six so we have Rachel Green then we
have Monica Geller then we have Phoebe
you have Phoebe Buffay not per day yeah
buffet and then we have Chandler Bing ok
sorry Chan Chandler Bing Joey Tribbiani
finally we have Ross Geller
okay I messed up something ok just this
color now if you save this so we have a
table a closing table tag we have TR for
a row and we have seven rows and in the
first row we have the heading for the
two columns and then in the remaining
rows we have the first name and the last
name of each of the characters so let's
reload this page you see you first name
last name then we have all the remaining
characters one thing's missing though
now excel file we have this nice border
that we want in our HTML page as well so
in our table tag we can specify an
attribute called border and this can be
equal to let's say one so when we save
it and reload it then we get a nice
border around around the cells table
cells and this border can we increase to
increase the thickness so if I make it
five and reload it so you get the
thickness of 5 so anyway that's how you
create a table and how to have rows and
columns within the table thank you guys
for watching I'll see you in the next
