first need to send the token from the
browser to the server and the way we
achieved that is using angular's HTTP
interceptor the HTTP interceptor
basically intercepts outgoing HTTP
requests transforms them and then sends
it to the server the Interceptor we will
be implementing will modify the request
to contain the token that is stored in
the browser's local storage so in this
video let's implement the token
interceptor service the first thing we
need to do is generate the service using
angular CLI so open the terminal
navigate inside the ng app folder and
over here run the command ng G for
generate s for service and then the name
of the service which is going to be
token interceptor once the file is
generated open it and over here first
let's import HTTP interceptor so import
HTTP interceptor from angular / comment
/ HTTP next we are going to make the
class implement the HTTP interceptor
interface token interceptor service
implements HTTP interceptor now by
asking the class to implement the
interface we have to define an intercept
method intercept the method takes two
arguments the request and next to pass
on the execution within the method first
let's make a clone of the request so let
tokenized
request is equal to request dot clone
and to the clone request let's add to
the header the authorization information
so set headers this is going to be an
object
the key is authorization and the value
is the token but
in a convention known as the bearer
token the format is the word bearer
followed by a space
followed by the actual token value for
now let's hard code a JSON web token so
let's go with a valid format xx dot YY
dot Z Z and then we pass on the
execution by returning next dot handle
and passing in the tokenized request all
right this should be sufficient to test
if the interception is working
so let's register this interceptor
service in the app module go to app dot
module dot es and first import HTTP
interceptors so next to HTTP client
module HTTP interceptors next import the
token interceptor service so we're here
import it and then add the service to
the providers array and this is slightly
different so go to the providers array
and over here we are going to specify an
object now the object is going to accept
three properties
the first one is provide so we are
providing HTTP interceptor and we
mentioned the class to be used so use
class and then it is the token
interceptor service class and finally we
set a property multi to be true so that
we can use multiple interceptors if
required
alright let's save this and test it out
go back to the browser open dev tools
and go to the network panel I'm going to
clear the log and now I'm going to
navigate to the events view and if I
click on this events API if I scroll
down you can see that the request
headers now has authorization and then
the authorization value is the bearer
token better followed by a space
followed by the JSON web token so the
interceptor is now working next let's
send the actual token instead of this
hard
coded token value so let's go back to
visual studio code let's create a new
method in the art service that fetches
the token value so the method is going
to be get token and it is going to
return local storage dot get item token
all right now we can use this in the
token interceptor service so go back to
took an interceptor service and import
add service but the way we inject auth
service is slightly different we are not
going to directly inject it in the
constructor this is because of a cyclic
dependency error that might occur
although it is supposed to be fixed in
the latest release of angular there are
still open issues on github so I'm going
to show you a way that is going to work
for sure even though it's slightly
different we will be using the injector
so over here import injectable and also
injector from angular slash core next we
are going to inject it so in the
constructor private injector of type
injector and then we are going to use
this injector to get an instance of the
odd service so in the intercept method
let add service is equal to this dot
injector dot get hot service and we can
use this to get the token so instead of
hard-coded token we are going to fetch
the actual token I'm going to change
this to backticks and then dollar with a
pair of curly braces add service dot get
token so this is the es6 syntax to
directly embed the value of the token as
part of this string all right our HTTP
interceptor is finally done let's test
it out one last time go back to the
browser and make sure that there is a
token in the local storage so we have
this dummy token let's delete it
let's login to add a valid token I'm
gonna go with a at a comm and then the
password is a login and then refresh you
should see the token present now let's
go to the network panel clear the log
and if I navigate to events and click on
the events API you can see that we have
the authorization the bearer token so
the very better followed by the actual
JSON web token alright now that we have
sent the token to the server let's see
how to verify it in the backend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
