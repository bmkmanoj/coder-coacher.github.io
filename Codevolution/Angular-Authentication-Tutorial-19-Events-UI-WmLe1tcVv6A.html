straightforward mainly HTML with
bootstrap classes so again I'm going to
copy paste the HTML and then explain
what some of the tags and classes are
going to do so open event dot component
dot HTML and then paste the HTML you can
of course find the HTML on my github
repo alright let's begin first we have a
div tag with the class row with a margin
top 5 so this is for additional spacing
at the top and then we have another div
tag within row for column and this is
going to span md4 with margin bottom of
3 so the intention here is with md 4 we
are going to have three events per row
bootstrap has 12 column grids so 4 4 4
we are going to have 3 in each row so
this is going to be in a for loop so
we're going to use the ng for structural
directive and then we are going to
iterate over events array that this is
the array that we have assigned the
events to so for each event in the
events array we are going to have a card
and this is going to have a body the
card body is going to contain a title
and some text the title is going to be
the name of the event the text is going
to be the description of the event a
dummy button that says buy tickets and
then in the card footer we are going to
share the date of the event we are going
to use a pipe filter with date formatted
to short date similarly let's copy paste
the HTML and the special events HTML as
well so copy this open special events
HTML and then paste it the only
difference here is instead of iterating
over the events array we are going to
eat trade over special events and just
for color difference and then
change primary to success so buy tickets
is going to be a green button instead of
a blue button alright it's time to test
the events component I'm going to go
back to the browser so the console and
then go to events and you can see that
we have list of regular events three
events per row buy tickets this is the
title the description the dummy button
and then the event date and if I
navigate to the members tab you can see
again the list of special events the
title the description the dummy buy
tickets button and then of course the
event date and you can see that we have
the difference in the color of the
buttons alright with this we have set up
a major portion of our UI but as you see
any user even not logged in can view
both the regular events and the special
events so in the next section let's add
authentication to our application to
make sure only logged in users are able
to navigate to the members route so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
