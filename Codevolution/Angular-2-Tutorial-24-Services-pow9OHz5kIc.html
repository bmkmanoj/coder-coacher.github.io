about services in angular2 now before I
explain what exactly is a service I want
to help you understand why services are
required in the first place so to
explain that I have a very simple
application now it just displays a list
of employees so let's quickly have a
look at the code so we start off with
the app module which is the root module
of our application and this app module
bootstraps the app component which is
the root component now in the app
component we just have an h1 tag that
has random company as the text and it
has two employee list component nested
inside it and in the employee list
component we have an hard-coded array of
employees that has ID name and gender
and using the ng4 directive we iterate
over this array displaying just the name
so now we have random company employee
list component and then the list of
employee names so far our application
works great but now let's say that our
boss comes in and tells us hey I need
another view which gives me the details
of all the employees the ID the name
gender everything so now we need a new
employee details component so we go
ahead and create the employee details
component again we use the ng4 directive
to iterate over the employees array and
we print the ID the name and the gender
but we have a problem here we don't have
the employee data available in this
component now we can of course
copy-paste the area of employees from
the employee list component to the
employee detail component but if we do
that we are going to be violating first
of the many good programming principles
which is the DRI principle do not repeat
yourself so we already have the employee
data code don't repeat it that is what
this principle basically tells and the
second principle which we have already
in fact violated is the single
responsibility principle in
angular every component should be
responsible for just handling the view
logic but in our application the view is
also responsible for creating and
managing the employee data so we
shouldn't be doing that we need to
ensure that there is a certain level of
abstraction so now how do we ensure all
these are checked the answer is services
a service is nothing but a class with a
specific purpose and in angular we are
going to be using services for mainly
three purposes the first one is to
implement any business logic that is
independent of any component for example
let's say that I need to calculate the
age from date of birth now you provide
the ear and the logic can give you the
age you don't really need a view with
HTML to do that it is component
independent so in such a scenario we are
going to be using services the second
scenario is we also use services to give
components access to shared data and
that is exactly the scenario we have at
hand we need to share the employee added
data to both the Employee List component
and the employee details component and
we'll learn how to do that shortly and
the third scenario is to handle external
interactions for example connecting to a
database so these are the three
scenarios let me quickly summarize what
we have learned and then we can proceed
with the next video so what is a service
a service is nothing but a class with a
specific purpose why do we use a service
to implement any business logic to get
access to share data and to handle any
external interactions but how do we use
services in angular2
the answer is dependency injection but
now what exactly is dependency injection
let's learn about that in the next video
so thank you guys for watching and don't
