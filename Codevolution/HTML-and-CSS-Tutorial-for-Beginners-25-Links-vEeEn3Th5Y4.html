let us talk about links now if you
recollect a link athletic got some sort
of a text or an image that will take you
to a target when it is clicked now a
link in HTML has four states and we can
assign styles to each of these four
states now what are the states let me
explain them now to select the anchor
tag we use a and to specify a state for
the anchor tag we use colon and then the
name of the state the first step is link
now this is nothing but when you open a
webpage for the first time and if there
is a link in the web page what is the
style that has to be applied so let us
just work with colors because they're
easy to you know visually identify and
similarly the second state is a the
second state is lower so when you move
your mouse code link what is the style
that has to be applied to the anchor tag
let's go with color green alright and we
have the third state which is active now
what this means is that when you click
on the particular link what is the style
that has to be applied let's give this
one a color of blue finally we have
another state called visited now what
this is suppose you click on a link to
visit some other maybe website and if
you open your own or the first web page
again what is the style that has to be
shown so let's go with color orange all
right now in our h1 tag let's create
an anchor tag so that it is big enough
to be visible now let's go with http www
dot the joke mom calm and let's say just
click here for web tutorials alright
save it refresh it and there you go we
have ok ok pretend you did not see that
now just out of it we have a link state
which is in red color so we have opened
the webpage for the very first time so
it is going to present us with a style
which is red colour the second state is
when you move your mouse over or
hovering above the link so when I move
my mouse over the link it is going to
change its color to green because we
have specified the style to be green
color now the third one is active now
active and the foot one has color orange
when your visited the third one is
active is when I click and hold my left
mouse button on the link then it is
going to be the style that is to be
applied so we have specified a blue
color so I have clicked the left mouse
button and the link is in blue color now
I'm going to click it and when I open
open this tutorial once again there you
go so I have revisited tutorial HTML now
this time this is a link that was
already visited so initially if you
remember for the very first time it was
red color now since this is a visited
link it is going to be orange color
because we have specified the style for
a visited state to be orange color so
yep those are the four states of the
anchor tag and how to assign state or
sorry how do you assign a style to each
one of these four states so anyway thank
you guys for watching and
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
