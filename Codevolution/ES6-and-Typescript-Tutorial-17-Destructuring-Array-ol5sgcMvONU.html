the structuring in es2015 now 2d
structure generally means to destroy the
structure or dismantle something right
so in this video our focus is going to
be on how to restructure arrays and
we'll simply structuring objects for the
next video so do the structure and array
is to pull apart the elements of the
array let us have a look at some of the
examples you can start off by creating a
simple employee Airy and is going to
hold three values first one is chandler
which is first name then we'll have Bing
which is the last name and then we'll
have mail which is the gender and next
I'm going to have this piece of code
right here alright within square
brackets I'm going to say first name
excuse me
he'll name which is last name and then
Chandler and this is going to be
assigned to this employee employee Eric
so what looks like an hour Recreation is
actually the destructuring of this
employee array so the first three
elements of the employee re are assigned
to these three variables so Chandler
gets assigned first name Bing to last
name and male to gender so we are
destructuring
this employee re by splitting up this
individual elements and assigning them
to these variables so one is the one
mapping Chan that first name brings your
last name male gender now if we can just
log first name and then log last name
and then log gender and have a look at
your output we have Chandler Bing and
male so that's a basic idea in this
structuring we take the individual
elements from an array and assign it to
individual variables now let's say
consider the second example we have we
don't have this male gender anymore but
still we are trying to us
or the structure this employee into
first name last name and gender what
happens then let's save this and have a
look at our console and says Chandler
Bing and undefined so we can still
specify any number of variables on the
left hand side while restructuring an
array but once the one is to one mapping
is done so Chandler to first name Bing
to last name and we don't have any more
values to assign to the variable
undefined is going to be the value for
this gender and so on so keep that in
mind now we can also omit variables on
the left hand side for example let's say
we have the gender again and now we only
want to save this male into this gender
variable we don't want to unnecessarily
have memory for a first name and last
name since we are not going to be using
it so in such a scenario we can just
omit it but this comma right here is
essential so now you can just come in
this out so comma comma and then gender
since we need the gender and we are
going to be structure employee into this
so let's save this there you go we just
have the gender now so it tests possible
to do structure an array with only the
necessary values that we require and we
can also be structure using the rest
operator so let me undo these changes
okay so the rest operator helps us to
have a single variable that can contain
a group of elements so let me replace
last name and gender by dot which is the
syntax for rest operators and then
elements now over here I'll just log
elements and I'm going to come in this
we don't have gender anymore so let's
save this and see what the output is so
we have Chandler and then another array
of Bing and male so we have Chandler
which is assigned to first name and now
since we have a rest operator the
remaining values are getting stored into
an array and assigned to this element
so when we log elements we have a new
array with Bing and mail if we had two
more values after mail then elements
would contain four values in total so
just keep in mind it is possible to use
rest operator while destructuring errors
and finally we can also use the
structuring with default values so let
me undo the changes again and now
suppose we don't have mail anymore
we don't have the gender so we're here
we can specify a default value so well
now when I save this
we have Chandler being a male so since
we are not specifying mail or a third
value in our employee array there is no
destructuring for this gender variable
so it is going to take meal as a default
value and it's going to log on to the
console so if I add female over here
let's save this so Chandler Bing female
so employee now has female as a third
value which can get assigned to this
gender variable so that's pretty much it
about the structuring arrays hope you
guys understood the few examples I was
able to explain like and subscribe if
you guys are enjoying the videos and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
