of the HTML series and in this video we
are going to be learning about lists now
HTML offers three ways to specify a list
of information and the first one is an
unordered list now an unordered list
each item in the list will be listed
using plain bullets and to create an
unordered list we make use of a UL tag
anyway let's that's enough of talking
let's see how to put that on to code I'm
going to be explaining lists not related
to friends so let me just quickly create
a file called list dot HTML alright and
let's have the basic so once again
doctype HTML we collect this if you have
forgotten then we have an HTML tag and
then a closing HTML tag then we have a
head tag and then we have a body tag and
then in our body tag is where we write
content that needs to be displayed now
since we're going to be talking about
lists and specifically unordered lists
let's create a list for our grocery
shopping so let's create a header let's
say h3 and it says grocery list and
under this we are going to have a list
of items that we need to purchase so the
tag is UL tag which is used to create an
unordered list and to specify each less
an unordered list you make use of the Li
tag which is like list item now our very
first item let's say we need bread and
then let's say we need eggs and let's
say we need cheese so when he goes ahead
and save it
and go to our HTML and CSS folder open
list dot HTML then we have a grocery
list and each of the lists is specified
using a plain bullet and that's how you
create an unordered list now let's say
we are allergic to these bullets so
don't worry we have a new we have a few
options that can be specified using the
type attribute so ul and let's say we
have type attribute is equal to circle
so save it and if you refresh it then
each of the plain bullets are turned
into circles another option we have
instead of circle is to have square so
when you specify square as the value for
the type attribute save it go back
refresh then we see that each of the
item is listed is having a square I
don't know what it's called it's it's
having a square and then finally we can
have none as a value to the attribute
and in that case we don't have any sort
of picture next to our item whatsoever
and by default our plain bullet there's
nothing but a disk so when you save it
as disk
refresh it then you have a disk so
anyway that's about unordered list you
create an unordered list using a ul tag
and these come in handy when the order
of the items listed is not particularly
important and by default you're going to
have a bullet against each of the items
and by using the type attribute of the
UL tag you can specify either circle
square or none of them and there you go
that's pretty much it about another list
in the next video let us see how to
create an ordered list so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
