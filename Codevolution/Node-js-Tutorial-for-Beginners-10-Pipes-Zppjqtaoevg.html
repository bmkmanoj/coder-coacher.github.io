piping because I forgot to mention about
this and the previous video so piping is
a mechanism in which you can read data
from a source and then write it to a
destination without having to manage
anything in between and once again we're
talking about piping so it's about
streams so let's give it and see an
example we of course need to use the
file system audio for this so variable
FS is equal to require FS now we are
going to create a readable stream so
very well readable stream is equal to FS
dot create read stream and let's say we
are going to be reading from in dot txt
let's also create a writable stream so
variable write table stream right of all
this that right okay
is equal to FS dot create write string
and let's type that out to our
destination file which is our dot txt
now so far nothing new and this is where
pipes come into play so without having
to do anything we can directly transfer
what we were reading in from our input
and to our destination which is output
and write an output dot txt
so readable stream dot pipe and then you
specify writable stream now before we
run this we are going to create a new
file call in dot txt and txt let's say
this
this is for this is for pipes save it
say where Abbas no let me go to our
command prompt and type node HS and go
back to our folder we have an out dot
txt file let's go ahead and open that so
we have in dot exe this I for pipes and
you know out dot txt this is so this is
how we you know pipe data from our
source to a destination without having
to balance any flow in between so yep
but there was a quick tutorial thank you
guys for watching and in our next video
we are going to start building our very
first node.js application well for
beginners of course so anyway please
subscribe and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
