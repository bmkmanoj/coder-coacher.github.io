a list of hard-coded videos so in this
video let us search the data from
MongoDB and then display it first we
need to create a service that is going
to handle all the crud operations so the
command to generate a service is ng G
which stands for generate followed by s
which stands for service followed by the
name of the service now I'm going to
call this video now what this does is it
creates a file video dot service dot TS
within the app folder so we're here
within the source folder within that
folder you should now have video dot
service dog TS alright so let's get
started over here now to get videos from
the database we need the HTTP service so
over here
import the HTTP service now next we are
going to use dependency injection to get
an instance of this HTTP so within the
constructor we are going to say private
so private underscore HTTP it is an
instance of HTTP so this is going to
give us give us an instance of HTTP to
make all our requests so in xpress we
have configured the different API roads
so in server dodgers we have / api with
step which stands for route api and in
AP idea to make a get request we need to
access slash videos so we're here in the
video service class let's declare that
so private underscore get URL is equal
to slash API slash
videos now let's define the method that
actually gets the video from the
database so over here I'm going to copy
paste the code and explain what it is
now the good videos method is going to
make use of this HTTP instance and then
we call the get method
passing this URL right here API slash
videos now when we fetch all the videos
we get back a response the response has
to be mapped to JSON so over here first
we are also going to import response and
then we are also going to import the map
operator so we're here import from our
xgf and slash operator slash map alright
now that we have a service to fetch the
data from the database
let's subscribe to the service from the
video center component so let's go to
video Center component TS and over here
in the ng on init method we are going to
subscribe to this particular service so
again let me explain what we have done
here so we have a red squiggly over here
because we need to provide it so this
video service is not going to work for
us over here let's see inside URL we are
going to have another providers array
and then what is the provider it is the
video service then we are going to
import video service so now we also need
to use the dependency injection so
private underscore video service is an
instance of video service and this
should be private all right so what have
we done we have imported the video
service we have used dependency
injection to get an instance of the
video service now using this video
service we are going to call the get
videos method that we have just defined
what does this method do is going to
subscribe and then catch all the videos
as a response and assign it to the
videos array over here so this videos
array is not going to be hard-coded
anymore in
and videos is just going to be an array
of type video all right now our code is
really let's go back to command prompt
business and test it out I let's head
over to the browser I'm going to refresh
this and there you go we have the three
videos from the database angular with
asp.net MVC MongoDB tutorial and no
tutorial when I click on it a valid URL
and then the description all right so
now that we are actually searching the
videos from the database in the next
video let's create an iframe to display
or to play the video corresponding to
this URL I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
