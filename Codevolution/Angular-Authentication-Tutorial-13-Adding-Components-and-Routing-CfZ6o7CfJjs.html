with four components registration login
regular events and special events let's
generate them using angular CLI and
configure the routing module for the
individual components so add a new
terminal navigate inside the ng app
folder CD ng app and run the command ng
G for generate C for component followed
by the name of the component in our case
the first component is the register
component what the command does is it
creates a new folder called register and
within the register folder creates an
HTML file a typescript file for testing
the regular component type script file
and a CSS file it also updates the app
module with an import to this register
component so if I navigate inside ng app
within the source folder within the app
folder we should have the register
folder with the four different files so
we have generated the register component
similarly let's generate the other
components next is login so ng G for
generate C for component and then log in
is the name of the component next let's
generate a component for events in gg4
generate C for component and then the
name of the component is events and
finally a component for the special
event so ng G for generate C for
component and then the name of the
component this is going to be special
events special - events alright now that
we have the four components created
let's setup the routes so in the source
folder open the file app dot routing dot
module dot TS this
is a routing module where we configure
the different routes for our application
so I'm going to hide this so you can see
that we have a constant named route
initialized to an empty array now the
routes are nothing but an array of
objects so let's add them one by one the
first route let's add it for the regular
event so remember each route is an
object the first property we specify
here is the path now the path is going
to be events and the component is going
to be the events component the second
route we define is for the special
events so again a pair of curly braces
the path is going to be special and then
the component to be rendered is the
special events component next the login
route a pair of curly braces hat is
going to be login and then the component
is going to be login component and then
of course the register route pair of
curly braces hat is going to be register
and then the component is going to be
register component now each time I added
the component also noticed that it was
automatically imported so make sure to
add the import statement at the top of
the file now finally we are going to add
one more route that this route is going
to be the default route so the path is
going to be an empty string and then we
are going to redirect this path to the
events path then we of course have to
specify the path match property to be
full for proper navigation so anytime a
user navigates to just localhost colon
4200 they're going to be redirected to
the events route and the events
component is going to be rendered
all right now that we have the routes in
place let's build the UI to navigate to
them and for UI I will be making use of
bootstrap for you can use any CSS
framework you are comfortable with but I
really like bootstrap for and it's
really simple to build layouts using
bootstrap so to add bootstrap go to get
bootstrap comm go to getting started
section in the introduction section we
have the QuickStart so copy paste the
CSS so CSS link go back to your Explorer
in the index dot HTML file and just
before the closing head tag paste the
link so we have a reference to the CSS
next let's add a reference to the
scripts so go back to get bootstrap and
in the chair section you can see that we
have three script tags so copy this go
back to index dot HTML just before the
closing body tag paste them and we are
good to go we can start using bootstrap
in our application so to change the HTML
go to app component dot HTML now I don't
really want to have you guys watch me
code some HTML and CSS so I'm going to
paste the HTML and explain what each bit
of the markup is so select all the HTML
and replace it with the HTML required
for our application alright to begin
with we have a navigation bar with a
dark theme we have a brand text which
says event hub and we have a toggle
button for responsiveness and coming to
the links in the navigation bar we have
one for each route on the left hand side
of the navigation bar you will see a
link to regular events and special
events on the right hand side a link to
login and register now how do we specify
avocation
with the routing directives router link
dictates what route the application will
navigate to and the router link active
directive specifies the class that has
to be applied when the particular route
is active so you can see the four
different routes configured and an
active class that gets applied if the
route as active events will navigate to
slash events members will navigate to
slash special login will navigate to the
login route and register will navigate
to the register route and finally at the
bottom we have a router outlet tag that
is going to render the particular
component in a container class
alright let's save this and take a look
at the browser to see how it looks so
I'm going to go back to ng-app and you
can see that the brand event hub a link
to regular events a link to special
events a link to login and register if I
click on them we are navigated to the
corresponding route and the active class
is applied to the particular link you
can see that register has a white font
or in other words an active class now
it's login now its members now its
events and if I navigate to just
localhost colon 4200 we are redirected
to slash events which is our default
route alright now that the navigation is
done let's start focusing on the
individual components starting with
registration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
