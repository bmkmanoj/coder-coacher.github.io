just want to take a few minutes to talk
more about this at injectable all right
so first of all what is it
now injectable is a decorator and why is
this decorator used now injectable is a
way to tell angular the dependency
injection is possible with the class so
here I mean to say that dependency
injection is possible with employee
service class and when should we use
this injectable decorator now when a
class does not have any other decorator
but it has some dependencies for example
a CTP then in such a scenario we need to
use injectable decorator so a class did
not have any decorator but it had a
dependency so in that case use
injectable and how is this decorator
injectable going to help angular so
basically angular emits certain metadata
only for classes that have a decorator
and this metadata is what tells angular
what type of an instance the injector
must provide as a dependency to this
particular class so let me explain or
elaborate more on that let's start with
the Employee List component now the
Employee List component has the add
component decorator so if I have a look
at the JavaScript now we see here that
employee list component is equal to
decorate and this decorate has this
metadata and in this metadata it
specifies employee service so this lets
angular know that employee service is
the instance or is the dependency that
this component has and that angular's
injector must provide employee service
instance to this particular class and if
I have a look at employee detail
component JavaScript it's the same so
employee detail component we have
decorate
it and in the decorate we have metadata
and employee service as the instance
that is required which is nothing but
the dependency now let's have a look at
employee service dot TS so over here I'm
going to go to the JavaScript file and
again employee service we have decorate
and decorate has metadata and this
metadata contains HTTP so employee
service needs an instance of HTTP which
is the dependency test for it's working
so now what I'm going to do is I'm going
to remove this injectable decorator and
show you what the change in the
JavaScript is so I'm going to save this
and let's hit the word back to employee
Jes employee service dot yes so now this
got regenerated and if you have a look
we don't have the decorate keyword
anymore and because of that the metadata
is not emitted and if there is no
metadata there is no dependency or there
is no HTTP mentioned here at all so
angular injector will not know what
instance has to be provided to this
particular class so I'm going to add
back the injectable keyword so let me
save this and go back to GS file and let
it regenerate and now there you go we
have decorate and when a class hat is
decorated it is going to angular is
going to emit some metadata and this
metadata contain what instance the class
requires so basically whenever you have
a dependency you need to make sure that
it is decorated the class has a
decorator now you might ask does that
mean I can decorate a class with
something other than injectable the
answer is yes you can attach any
decorator you wish to for example we
have the component decorator for
employee details and employee list
component but we attach injectable only
because it logically sounds right
of course I don't want a component
decorator for
employee service but I need to attach
some decorator and injectable you know
logically sounds right I need to inject
or this class can be injected with
something now for example you say that a
person is dependable meaning that you
can depend on that person similarly this
class is injectable meaning I can inject
something into this class such as HTTP
and in some of the articles that I've
come across people explain that you add
injectable decorator when you need to
inject this class in some other
component for example this employee
service has to be injected into employee
detail and employee list but that is not
true adult you decorate a class with
injectable when something else has to be
injected into this particular class so
all right I hope I cleared some of the
questions or queries you might have on
the injectable decorator thank you guys
