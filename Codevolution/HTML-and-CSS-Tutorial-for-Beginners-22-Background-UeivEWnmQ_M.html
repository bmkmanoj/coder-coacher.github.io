going to be studying about is the
background property and first let us see
how to assign a background color to an
HTML element now let's say we want to
assign a color of light green to our
body tag so within our style tag we are
going to use the body selector and then
within the brackets to specify a
background color
well it's straightforward you use the
background color property and we can
assign the light green color so save it
and when you refresh it the entire body
of our HTML document is going to be in
light green and suppose we create
another style let's say for the
paragraph tag and give a background
color of red and create a paragraph
within our body tag this is in red and
when you save it when reload it you get
a nice little paragraph over here in a
body tag but the background color of
this paragraph is going to be in red
color and this is going to be overlapped
on our body tag so the red color is
going to appear on the light green color
the next the next thing we have here is
a background image property and that is
used to specify an image that is to be
used as a background for some element
now for our body tag let's say okay let
me quickly remove this paragraph and
paragraph so for a body tag let's
specify a background image so a
background image is going to be
specified using background - image
property and this is going to take an
URL and this is going to be where our
image is located
now in my folder HTML and CSS I have the
tutorial HTML and Friends image and the
same folder so I can just specify
friends dot jpg and when I save it and
reload it it's going to have the image
of friends or defense image displayed
across the body now here's the thing
though I if we have a smaller image
let's say okay so I just finished
watching the episode of the flash so I
just downloaded an image of the flash so
let's replace friends by the flash dot
jpg save it reload it and this is what
happens whenever we have an image that
is smaller in size that the screen it is
going to get repeated both in the x
direction and the y direction now to
avoid this or to avoid repetition of the
image we can use another property called
background repeat' now what does what
this does is it has three possible
values the first one has repeat X all
right so what we are going to specify
here is that okay
repeat only in the X direction that is
from left to right and we can also use
the repeat Y from repeat Y value to
repeat the image only in the Y direction
and finally we have the value no-repeat
now this is going to use the image or
display the image only once and it is
going to avoid repetition and the X and
y direction and finally to specify or
let's say a position we are going to use
the background position
properly so we have a background
position that let's say we can give 50
pixels from the left and then 100 pixels
from the top now when we save it and
reload it now this image right here is
50 pixels from the left of my screen and
then 100 pixels from the top of the
screen so if I say let's say 500 pixels
from the left and reload it and is going
to be pushed further to the right and
also let's say we want our image to be
fixed then we can use a property called
background proper background fixed sorry
a background attachment and this is
going to be taking a value of fixed now
what this does is alright let me quickly
add some paragraphs because we need that
for the demonstration so this is okay
let me just have this and then copy it
and then create multiple multiple tags
let me just copy these again quicker
quicker quicker okay save it so what
this does is all right we have a
paragraph on the left hand side now you
see this even though we are scrolling
the image is going to be fixed in that
particular position it is not going to
scroll with the paragraphs and yep so to
summarize we have a background image
probably that we use to specify an image
as a background for an HTML element in
our case the body we have a background
repeat' probably which is used to either
repeat in X or Y directions or not
repeat an image at all and we have a
background position probably which we
can use to specify where the image has
to be positioned and we also have a
background attached
and that says to fix our image on a
particular location and of course we
first saw the background color which is
used to specify a background color for
any HTML element so that's pretty much
it for this video thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
