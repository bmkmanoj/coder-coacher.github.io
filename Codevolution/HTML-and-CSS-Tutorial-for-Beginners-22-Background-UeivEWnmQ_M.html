going to be studying about is the
background property and first let us see
how to assign a background color to an
HTML element now let's say we want to
assign a color of light green to our
body tag so within our style tag we are
going to use the body selector and then
within the brackets to specify a
background color well heads straight
forward you use the background color
property and we can assign the light
green color so save it and when you
refresh it the entire body of our HTML
document is going to be in light green
and suppose we create another style
let's say for the paragraph tag and give
a background color of red and create a
paragraph within our body tag this is n
red and when you save it when reloaded
you get a nice little paragraph over
here in a body tag but the background
color of this paragraph is going to be
in red color and this is going to be
overlapped on our body tag so the red
color is going to appear on the light
green color the next the next thing we
have here is a background image property
and that is used to specify an image
that is to be used as a background for
some element now for our body tag let's
say okay let me quickly remove this
paragraph and paragraph so for a body
tag let's specify a background image so
a background image is going to be
specified using background hyphen image
property and this is going to take an
URL and this is going to be where our
image is located
now in my folder HTML and CSS I have the
tutorial HTML and Friends image and the
same folder so i can just specify
friends dot jpg and when I save it and
reload it it's going to have the image
of friends or defense image displayed
across the body now here's the thing
though I if we have a smaller image
let's say okay so i just finished
watching the episode of the flash so i
just downloaded an image of the flash so
let's replace friends why the flash dot
jpg save it reload it and this is what
happens whenever we have an image that
is smaller in size that the screen it is
going to get repeated both in the X
direction and the y direction now to
avoid this or to avoid repetition of the
image we can use another property called
background repeat' now what this what
this does is it has three possible
values the first one is repeat x alright
so what we are going to specify here is
that ok repeat only in the X direction
that is from left to right and we can
also use the repeat why prop repeat y
value to repeat the image only in the y
direction and finally we have the value
no-repeat now this is going to use the
image or display the image only once and
it is going to avoid repetition and the
x and y direction and finally to specify
or let's say a position we are going to
use the background position
property so we have a background
position that let's say we can give 50
pixels from the left and then 100 pixels
from the top now when we save it then
reload it now this image right here is
50 pixels from the left of my screen and
then 100 pixels from the top of the
screen so if i say let's say 500 pixels
from the left and reload it it is going
to be pushed further to the right and
also let's say we want our image to be
fixed then we can use a property called
background proper background fixed sorry
a background attachment and this is
going to be taking a value of fixed now
what this does is all right let me
quickly add some paragraphs because we
need that for the demonstration so this
is okay let me just have this is and
then copy it and then create multiple
multiple tags let me just copy these
again quicker quicker quicker okay save
it so what this does is all right we
have a paragraph on the left-hand side
now you see this even though we are
scrolling the image is going to be fixed
in the particular position it is not
going to scroll with the paragraphs and
yep so to summarize we have a background
image probably that we use to specify
and image as a background for an HTML
element in our case the body we have a
background repeat' probably which is
used to either repeat in x or y
directions or not repeat an image at all
and we have a background position
probably which we can use to specify
where the image has to be positioned and
we also have a background attached
and that says to fix our image on a
particular location and of course we
first saw the background color which is
used to specify a background color for
any HTML element so that's pretty much
it for this video thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
