and to quickly inform you I have renamed
tutorial 5 TS as tutorial 60s that which
is going to generate the corresponding
tutorial sixth rjs which i have
referenced here in our index dot HTML
file and the content is however the same
from the previous video we still have
the grid person function and the call to
a grid person so in the last video we
learned that war declaration hoist and
uses functional scope now in es2015
we have a new keyword for declaring
variables namely the let keyword the
difference however is that let
declaration are not hoisted and our
block scope so let us understand the
delete keyword with a few examples so
let us change this war declaration to
lead so let and let now this gives us a
red underline over here and if I hover
over it it says cannot find name greet
and this happens because let is blocks
code now a block is any section of code
within curly braces like the if block or
the else block for while and so on so
the first let is coped to the if block
and the second led to the else block
so our greet is outside the scope of the
let declaration and that's why it does
not reference anything so we can
conclude that war declaration gives us
functional school whereas let
declaration gives us block scope so to
fix this code we simply move the let
declaration to the top and remove the
declaration inside the if/else block so
over here we are going to have let greed
greet and here we are going to remove
this and over here as well so when I
save this browser is going to refresh
and we still have hello Chandler
if I remove
and save this says hi there so our
function is still working pretty good
okay so let me give you another example
so that it becomes more clear to you
let's create more a equals one and our B
equals two
let's have an if condition if a triple
equal to one let's say VAR a is equal to
10 and let B is equal to 20 then we just
console dot log a and B a and console
dot log B and outside the f-block let's
again console dot log a and console log
log B so I'm going to give you two
seconds to guess what the output could
be and then I'll reveal it so let me
save this one too okay let's have a look
the outer output is going to be 10 2010
- so let's see how that works
initially we have equals 1 and B equals
2 now in our if condition we check if a
triple equals 1 which is true so we go
inside the if block now we are
reassigning water to 10 and B with let
declaration to 20 now if you remember
war as functional scope but as let is
block scoped so let B is going to apply
that within this if block the value of B
is going to be 20 and over here a is
going to be 10 so this is going to give
us 10 and this is going to give us 20 so
that is how we have initially 10 and 20
now when we go out of the if block
because it is a war declaration the
value of 10
I'm going to persist so we are still
going to have ten however because this
was a late declaration the value is
going to remain only within they've
block though the value bar b equals two
is going to be printed over here so 10
2010 to 10 2010 to so that's pretty much
it about let the block scope of the led
declaration now another key point is
stress down here is that let
declarations are not hoisted so if we
move this light declaration below
console dot log you see that we get a
red underline so moving so moving this
declaration over here we can not use the
variable before it is declared using
lead keyword so once you declare it you
can use it you cannot use it before it
is declared so that means to say that
let keyword does not host the variable
declaration and finally unlike war
declaration let declaration cannot be
read eclair so what I'm going to say is
that let's say variable egg or let's say
variable c equals 1 and i can have again
where you'll see is equal to 2 this is
completely fine however let D is equal
to 1 let D equals 2 you cannot do this
we get a red underline cannot read
eclair log scope variable D so you
cannot declare or you cannot read Eclair
using let keyword within the scheme same
scope however you can have the
declaration and different scopes so let
me move this back to the top and I can
still have led over here and let over
here however now we have three different
greet declarations so this let grid is
going to be outside this if/else block
the value and within this F block we
have a lip declaration
so this grid variable will be assigned
hello
only the safe block then an else block
we have this another led declaration so
three different declarations so let has
been introduced to replace the war in
the long run so you can start using lead
instead of the war keyword you should be
pretty easily able to replace war with
let if you're not able to you probably
have found something wrong in your code
so there's going to be it for the block
scoping and not hosting of the lead
declarations so thank you guys for
watching don't really subscribe I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
