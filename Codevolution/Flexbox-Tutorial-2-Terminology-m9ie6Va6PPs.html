terminology which is required to have a
proper understanding of
flexbox and how it works when we talk
about flexbox we mainly have two
entities a parent container which we
term as the Flex container and the
immediate children elements which we
term as Flex items if you take a look at
sample HTML the parent div is the Flex
container and all the children divs are
the Flex items and we also deal with two
axis when working with flexbox the main
axis and the cross axis by default the
main axis runs left to right and the
cross axis is perpendicular to the main
axis and runs top to bottom the starting
point of the main axis is termed as main
start and the end point is termed as
main end the length from main start to
main end is called the main size so we
can say that the Flex items flow from
main start till main end and take up the
main size as the length
similarly with cross axis we have cross
start cross end and cross size we can
also change the direction of the main
and cross axis but we will talk more
about that later in the course now
understanding flexbox is basically
getting familiar with the properties
associated with the Flex container and
the Flex items nothing fancy we just
learn it like have you learned
CSS know what properties exist and how
they work so in the next video let's
begin by focusing first on all the
properties that are associated with just
the Flex container I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
