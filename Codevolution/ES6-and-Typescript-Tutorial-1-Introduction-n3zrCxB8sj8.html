us and welcome to a brand new series on
es2015 and typescript now this video is
going to be an introduction which is
going to set us up for the rest of the
series all right so the first thing is
we need to know what is es5 what is
es2015 also known as es6 and what is
typescript so I'm pretty sure you guys
have heard of JavaScript now what we
call JavaScript is one of the
implementations of a standard
specification called ECMAScript or ACMA
Script and the spec version that has
been used these last few years is
version 5 and that is how we have es 5
now we use es 5 when referring to a
standard while JavaScript is used when
talking about the language in practice
but now a new version of the
specification has been approved which is
called Eggman script 2015 or es 2015 and
it was also formerly known as es6 so
throughout the video series if I refer
to es6 it is going to refer to es 2015
and vice versa
so yes 2015 is the evolution of es 5 so
it adds a tremendous amount of features
to JavaScript such as classes constants
add functions and many more and these
features are exactly what we are going
to be learning for the first half of
this series so to put it in simple terms
es 2015 is equal to es 5 plus awesome
new features now this brings us to
typescript now typescript is a free and
open source programming language the
base develop and maintained by Microsoft
on the official typescript website it
states that typescript is a typed
superset of JavaScript that compiles to
plain JavaScript so
in typescript we also have types such as
numbers strings and boolean and this is
completely optional you can choose to
use them or ignore them now the main
benefit of theis typescript is that
you're right we are it's like we are not
writing lesser code but we are writing
safer and bug-free code and we will dive
into the details of typescript in the
second half of this series but now but
for now that's pretty much what I wanted
to cover in this introductory video so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
