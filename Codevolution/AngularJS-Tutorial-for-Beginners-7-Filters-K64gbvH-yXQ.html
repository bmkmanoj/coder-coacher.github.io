look at filters the filters help you to
format your expressions and they can
also be used with directives let us go
through some examples to learn how
filters work let's go to app touches and
in a controller create a new array of
employees so dollar scope dot employees
is equal to an array and in our array
they specify our first employee the
employee has a first name Chandler
there's also a last name Bing and let's
say an employee has salary and Chandler
earns 50,000 and quick quickly copy the
employee and paste it to create two new
employees and we can change the name of
her second employee to Ross Geller
and let's say Ross wants 40,000 and we
have finally joey tribianni and let's
say Joey earns 30000 and save up Jess
get back to your index dot HTML file and
let's see how to display the data now if
you recollect when we have to display
data from an array we're going to be
making use of the ng-repeat
director so create a new div tag and
specify and she repeat is equal to
employee and employees so we are going
to be iterating through each employee
and the employees collection and
assigning it to an employee variable so
let us go and see how to display the
first-name lastname and the salary
create a paragraph tag
and type first name is employee dog
first name and then last name is
employee dot last name finally we have
salary is employee dot salary go ahead
and save it now if you reload a browser
we get all the data from our array so we
have our first employee Chandler Bing he
runs fifty thousand we have Ross Geller
who earns 40,000 finally Joey Tribbiani
here's 30,000 now what filters do is
allow you to format your expression let
us say we want the first name to be
displayed only in the upper case so go
ahead add a pipe character and type
upper case now how will this work are
there's going to be a left-hand side
which is the expression followed by a
pipe character and a right-hand side
which is the filter now the left-hand
side is going to be processed through
the pipe and applied the upper case
filter let us see how the output looks
go ahead and save it reload it and now
we see that all the first-name employees
have Chandler Ross Joey in uppercase
similarly we also have a lower case
filter so lower case save it now if we
notice B is capital and Bank reloaded on
the last name have been turned to
lowercase now we can also have a
currency filter now what this currency
filter is does is going to take a
numerical value and convert it into a
currency if you refresh it salary is
$50,000 it also adds two decimal places
we also have
another filter called limit to so limit
to and it takes an option which is the
number of characters so if you type
limit to 3 and save it and that is the
first name only three letters are
displayed so what the limit to filter
does is it is going to restrict the
number of characters and the expression
it's also possible to chain folders so
go ahead and type uppercase and then it
is followed by the limit to filter save
it reload it we see that the first name
is uppercase and all the three cases and
it has been limited to just three
characters now it is also possible to
use filters with a directive let us see
you some what the ng-repeat now within
our ng-repeat add a piping character and
type limit too and the same let's
specify the option as to now when the
limit to filter is used with an NG
repeat it is going to limit the
iterations to only twice so when you
reload it we have Chandler Bing we have
Ross color but we don't have Joey
Tribbiani only the first two items and
the collection is going to be processed
we can also use another directive called
order by so order by now order by takes
the data with which you want the sword
so let us say we want to sort it by
salary save it
reload it now if you see we have Joey
who has the least salary as our first
item so our first employee so with Sally
thirty thousand which is followed by
salary of 40,000 and finally salary of
fifty thousand and assorted by
descending order just add a hyphen sign
before salary save it and then reload it
we have 50,000 as first employee 40,000
followed by 30,000 so that's pretty much
it about filters we'll just can reuse
the format exhibitions and directives it
usually follows a left-hand side an
exhibition then a piping character
followed by the filter that you want to
use now in our next video let's go ahead
and study about a new directive called
ng-click
so I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
