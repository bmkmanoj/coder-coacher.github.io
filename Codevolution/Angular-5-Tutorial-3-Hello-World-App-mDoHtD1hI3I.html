and run a hello world angular
application for this series I have
created a new folder called angular and
we will mainly be working within this
folder so let's create a very first
angular application and for that we make
use of the angular CLI and Visual Studio
code has an integrated terminal from
where you can run your commands so go to
view and click on integrated terminal
and over here make sure you're inside
the angular folder to create a new
angular project run the command ng new
followed by the project name which in
our case is going to be hello world so
hello - world the command takes a few
minutes to run but once it completes you
must have a HelloWorld folder created
now back in the terminal run the command
CD hello world to navigate inside the
project folder and then run the command
ng serve to run your application once we
get the message compiled successfully
from web pack you can go back to your
browser and open the URL localhost colon
4200 and you can see some HTML from the
angular application being displayed so
your very first angular application up
and running by executing just a couple
of commands this is the power of angular
CLI but of course it is important to
understand how exactly the control flows
when you run an angular application and
from where all this HTML is being
displayed so let me go over on a
high-level angular's architecture and
explain the flow of execution of any
basic angular application now the first
building block is a module angular apps
are modular in nature so an angular
application is just a collection of many
individual modules every module
represents a feature area in your
application
for example we can have a user's module
that is related to the application users
and an admin module that is related to
the application administrators but at
the end of the day an angular module is
just lines of code that can be imported
or exported keep in mind though every
angular application has at least one
module which is the root module and by
convention this is called as the app
module now each module is in turn made
up of components and services a
component controls a portion of the view
on the browser for example we can have a
component for navigation one for sidebar
and one for the main content but again
your angular application will have at
least one component which would be the
root component of your application and
this is again called the app component
by convention all other components will
be nested inside this root component
each component will have an HTML
template to represent the view in the
browser and a class that controls the
logic of that particular view module
will also have services which is
basically a class that contains the
business logic of your application in
addition to components and services a
module can contain a few more pieces of
your angular application
but for now components and services will
be something we will be focusing a lot
in the series so to summarize this
architecture angular apps contain one or
more modules each module contains one or
more components and services each
component contains an HTML template and
a class to control the logic for that
particular view module can also have
services which contains the business
logic of your application the modules
export and import code as and when
required and finally render the view in
the browser alright with this
understanding let's take a look at some
of the files in our project folder and
how the execution flows
in Visual Studio code we have the hello
world project folder and there are a lot
of files so I'm gonna go over only a few
of them that are really important at
this stage the first one is the
package.json file that this file
contains the dependencies and the dev
dependencies which are nothing but the
libraries or modules that are required
for your angular application the world
the packages listed here get installed
when you run the command in gnew hello
world and all the packages get installed
inside the node modules folder we also
have some of the scripts that can be
executed the ng self command is one of
them which runs our application you can
also execute npm start which will
internally call the ng serve command
alright next we have the source folder
which is what we will be concerned with
most of the time in this series in this
source folder we have the main dot ES
file which is the entry point to our
angular application we also have the app
folder which contains the file AB dot
module dot es which is the root module
of our application and also AB dot
component dirtiest which is the root
component of our application when we run
the command in deserve to start our
application the execution comes to the
main dot ES file over here we bootstrap
or kick start the app module in our app
module you can see that we in turn
bootstrap or again kickstart the app
component and this app component has two
things the HTML template and the class
to control the view logic so we have the
HTML template over here and the
typescript file which contains the class
that contains the logic or the data for
the view in the class we have a property
title is equal to a string app and inner
HTML we have welcome to title but at
runtime this title gets replaced by this
property app and then we also have some
other HTML
that get rendered in the browser so we
have welcome to and then app which is
nothing but the property in the class
that gets bound to the HTML template so
we have welcome to app and the rest of
the HTML elements now back in an app
component class which contains the
property title if I change app to code
evolution save this and head over to the
browser you can see that the browser
automatically refreshed and the message
welcome to code evolution is now
displayed well that is the basic
functioning of a hello world angular
application when you run the command ng
serve
it starts with main dot es goes to app
module and then goes to app component
the data property title gets rendered in
the HTML which is what you will see in
the browser now as I mentioned in the
architecture components represent
different portions of view in the
browser and they make up for a major
portion of your angular application so
for the next couple of videos let's take
a more detailed look at components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
