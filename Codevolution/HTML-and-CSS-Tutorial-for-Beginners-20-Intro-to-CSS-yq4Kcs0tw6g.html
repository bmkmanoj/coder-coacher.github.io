we've been learning only about HTML
which is like the skeletal system offer
web pages now it's finally it's finally
time to learn how to make that skeletal
system look attractive so that's right
it's time to learn about CSS now what
exactly is CSS CSS stands for cascading
style sheets and it describes how our
HTML elements are to be displayed on the
screen for example if a heading tag
should have a color or if a paragraph
tag should have a background color or if
a table should have a dotted or a dashed
border or if the font style should be
let's say take our Times New Roman if
the site should be 24 or 26 well
CSS is responsible for all of the above
and whenever we work with CSS we always
make use of the head section of our
document so and to specify CSS we make
use of a pair of style tags so in our
head section let's create a style tag
and open it and close it so style and
then closing style now this title tag
takes an attribute called type and for
CSS we need to specify it to be text
slash CSS now this whatever it goes
between these this pair of style tag is
going to be the CSS that is going to be
applied for our web page now the syntax
of CSS is made up of three parts the
first one is a selector and the second
one is a property and the third one is a
value now this selector is nothing but
an HTML tag to which we want to apply
the style and the second part right here
the property this is somewhat of an
attribute for the HTML tag so it can be
something like a font color or a font
size or the background color
or the height wealth and so on and
finally the third part which is the
value is the value for our property so
let's say if the property is font size
we can specify it to be 24 pixel if it
is a color we can specify something like
blue or green and you get the idea so
let's go ahead and create our very first
style now this selector is nothing but a
tag so the replace this selector with
the paragraph tag now you don't need to
include the lesser than and greater than
sign when specifying CSS just the
paragraph P notation is sufficient now
property let's say we want our paragraph
to be and the color red so the property
is going to be color and then the value
is going to be red now let's see how to
view this in our body let's quickly
create two lines of code so not code but
yeah let's create two lines the first
one is this as plain old boring text and
then let's create a paragraph and within
the paragraph this is a super cool line
with style all right so I have created
this in a file called tutorial dot HTML
I'm just gonna save it and now if we
open it let's see open it in a browser
now the first line is planing plain old
boring text and the second one is the
paragraph for which we have applied the
style to so the paragraph tag is going
to be in red color now this is just the
beginning of CSS and from the next video
let us see what are the different styles
that can be applied to the various tags
in HTML to make our website attractive
and let's begin by learning a bit more
about this color property that we can
use for HTML tags
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
