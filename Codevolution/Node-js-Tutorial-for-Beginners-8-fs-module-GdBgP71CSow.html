eight of the nodejs series now in
node.js whenever we want to perform file
i/o like read from a file or write to a
file then we make use of a core module
called the filesystem module and every
function and the FS module is going to
have a synchronous form and an
asynchronous form so let's understand
with an example by reading data from a
file how the filesystem module works so
let's first create our input file from
where we are going to read our data from
so just file save it as and Kurt dot txt
and let's say this is the input file
contains nothing useful just read this
stuff ok excuse me to save it go back to
your app yes now as usual we are going
to require our file system module so
variable FS is equal to require FS
that's a core module now in the next
line first we are going to read the data
asynchronously and synchronously yeah so
FS dot read file so we are going to be
making use of the read file function and
the FS module and our first parameter is
going to be the input file so input dot
txt and the second parameter is going to
be an anonymous callback function so
function and this callback function is
going to take two parameters the first
one is an error if at all one occurred
and the second one is the data that was
read from the input file so in the body
we can type if there was an error then
lot that error on to your console so
console dot log error and if there was
no error and we have ended up reading
the data
let's just console that out so async
data is and then concatenated with our
data but we also need to convert it into
a string so data adult to string and
let's now read again in the synchronous
form so we are going to use a variable
called data to store what is read from
the file so variable data is equal to FS
dot read file sync because it is a
synchronous version of it and we just
specify that bit file so input dot txt
now once we have read the data let's
print that out on to your console it's a
console dot log synchronous data is and
then plus beta dot to string function
all right then let's just say console
dot log this is the end
okay so let's save this and let's go to
our open a command prompt and when we
execute node AB dot yes then it's a sync
data is and we get the data from our
input file then this is the end and then
asynchronous data this and we could we
get the data again from the file so
what's happening here now our first read
was an asynchronous one and the second
read was a synchronous one now what
happens in the asynchronous read is we
are going to read the data from the
input dot txt file but we are not going
to block the next line of code whenever
the data is retrieved then we call back
this function which is going to print in
order print in our console the data
whereas in the synchronous form it is
going to block the execution till it
reads the input dot txt file once it
reads it is going to print that out your
console and then we are going to say
console dot log this is the end and
after that we have our data retrieved in
the asynchronous function and it ends up
printing on to the console so even
though we have an asynchronous function
before the synchronous function this is
have no J's execution works by using the
callback function so we don't have to
block code now I'm just repeating this
concept of callback function so that it
is sort of imprinted on your mind how it
works and anyway that'sthat's pretty
much it about the filesystem module how
you can read from a file in the
synchronous and asynchronous way so
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
