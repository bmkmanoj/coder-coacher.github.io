number 28
now just like how we export variables we
can also export functions and classes in
es2015
and this video is particularly helpful
if you have plans of learning angular 2
because exporting classes there is one
of the most fundamental things in
angular so let's have a look at some
examples over here in module b gs i'm
going to create a new function function
greet and this is going to accept a
parameter and all it does is going to
log to the console the message that is
passed so we also need to have a
semicolon over here and then to export
the function just like exporting a
variable we attach this export keyword
at the beginning so now that our
function is ready to be exported let's
go ahead and import it in module a so
import and within curly braces the name
of the function so agree and where are
we importing it from the current
directory module bjs so now that we have
the function we can go ahead and call it
so greet and let's pass hello world so
when we save this and go check our
browser it says hello world so that's
the basic idea behind exporting
functions and importing them just add
the export keyword and you import it and
you can call it in the module where you
have imported it so next let's have a
look at how to export an import classes
so I'm going to create a new class greet
message and this is going to have a
constructor and within the constructor
let's just log constructor and let's
also have a simple function greet but
this time without any variables or
parameters sorry and it's just going to
log to the console greet function now to
export the class we use the export
keyword again and attach it at the very
beginning so let's go back to module 8
and
by next to the greeting or greet we
specify greet message and over here
let's create a new instance of the class
so let GM is equal to a new greet
message and let's also call GM dot
grieved and when we save this and head
over to the browser we have hello world
which is the function and then we have
the constructor invoked and then we have
the greet function log to the console so
over here we have the constructor and
the greet function both of them were
imported and involved when we created
this instance of the class so that
brings us to the end of modules in es
2015 please like comment and subscribe
if you guys are enjoying the video I'll
see you guys in the next one
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
