folder called Budget Manager on my
desktop and we are going to be creating
all our extension files within this
particular folder and just like before
we are going to start off our extension
by creating the manifest file I'm going
to create a new film manifest dot JSON
okay so we start off with a pair of
curly braces and then we start with
manifest underscore version and this is
going to be two and then we have the
name for our extinction which is going
to be Budget Manager we are also going
to have the extension version so a
version is going to be let me just put
it in code okay so the version is going
to be 1.0 we can also have a description
so description and this is just going to
say this extension tracks your overall
spendings alright now we can also have
the icons so icons and we need to
specify three icons one of 128 by 128 so
this is going to be icon 128 dot PNG we
also need to have a 48 by 48 so 48 and
then I can't party eight dot PNG and
finally a 16 by 16 so 16 icon 16 dot PNG
so once we have the icons the next thing
we need to specify is that our extension
is going to be a browser action
extension so browser underscore action
need to specify the default icon and the
default pop-up so default underscore
icon and this is going to be icon
sixteen dot PNG and the default pop-up
so default our scope pop-up and this is
going to
pop-up dot html' all right that's it for
the manifest file at this stage we will
come back to this later on when we need
to add more functionality to our
extension</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
