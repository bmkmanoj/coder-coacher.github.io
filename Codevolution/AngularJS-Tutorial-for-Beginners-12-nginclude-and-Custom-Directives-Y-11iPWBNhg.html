are going to be learning about a new
directive called ng directive ng include
sorry and also how to create our own
custom directors now consider the
following code snippet let's create a
div tag and within the div tag let's say
we have a paragraph tag the taste my
name is joe mon and i like to learn now
suppose we have this exact piece of code
these two lines that need to be used in
ten other web pages in your website and
one way to do it is just copy paste in
all the ten pages but that will lead to
duplication of code a better way to do
it is to use a directive called ng
include to do that what we it we will be
doing is cut the two lines of code and
create a new file and paste it and save
this file as as let's say userinfo dot
HTML and we go back to index dot HTML
and in the dip tag just include ng
include is equal to within double coat
you have to have single codes again and
then within the single codes mention
user info dot HTML now go ahead and save
this save your user info dot HTML when
you go to your browser and load it well
we don't have the changes yet well you
can't well if if you go to if you press
f12 and see a console it says xml
httprequest cannot load now i'm not
going to dive into what the error is all
about with how to work around this error
open a new tab type web server for
chrome
and just click on the first one so you
get this 200 okay web server for Chrome
App I've already downloaded it just I'm
going to go ahead and launch it and I'm
going to include the folder that I have
the index dot HTML n so which is the
angularjs folder that we've been working
with click on the URL that it provides
if we load the page from a server we
have my name is joe de menthe i like to
learn so this is a better way to avoid
duplication in your code by using the ng
include directive then a better way then
this is to create your own custom
directive let's see how now we're going
to have this user info dot HTML acid is
well in your app guess we're going to
create a directive that type AB director
of the first parameter is the name of
the name of the directive so let's say
user info information let's say user
information and the second one as a
function and on anonymous function no
the anonymous function returns an object
so return an arm check then it returns
so the first thing we have to specify is
restrict or restrict specified if you
are creating a directive as an HTML
element or as an attribute for an HTML
element so let's say we are creating an
HTML element we are going to have e and
we are also going to specify a template
URL now this is this tells where it
needs to pick up the HTML file from so
the template URL as user info dot HTML
look at the semicolon semicolon go ahead
and save this now index dot HTML replace
this dip tagged with user infor mation
and again close it user information when
you go ahead and save it save your app
yes go back to your server reload it and
you still have my name is joe come on i
like to learn so that's how you create a
new HTML element for example we are
created a user information which is
actually a directive now if you want to
include a directive as an attribute just
change this to a which stands for
attribute go back to your index.html and
use it as an attribute so div user
information and div so save it let me go
back and save up jess reloaded we still
have my name is good Mon I like to learn
now why would we want to use our own
custom directives because that helps us
to express our HTML and a more
understandable way for example we can
have hundreds of lines of code that use
a template as an HTML and we can just
replace the entire 100 lines by a single
directive and that is going to be more
informaiton to anyone who can read the
code and who has not used your
application so anyway that's about ng
include and how to create your own
custom directive either as an HTML
element or as an attribute thank you for
