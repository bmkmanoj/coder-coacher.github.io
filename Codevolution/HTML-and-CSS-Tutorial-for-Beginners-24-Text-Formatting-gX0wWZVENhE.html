number 24 of the HTML CSS series in this
video let us learn about the text
properties in CSS now the first one is
the color property which we are already
seen so let's say we have an h1 selector
you can specify a property called color
and something like red and in our body
tag if we create an h1 tag and type some
text this is red then we are going to
have a red colored h1 tag displayed in
our browser so the next property we have
is the text alignment now in our h1 tag
we are going to use a property called
text align now this text align properly
can take three values actually 4 but
let's start with 3 the first one has
left alignment now whenever you want the
text to be left aligned let me use a
text align properly with value left now
let's also create an institute selector
with text align probably off-center and
let's also create h3 tag with a text
align property off right now let's
create an h2 in an h3 in our body body
tag so h2 this is what is its center
text and then we can have a ch3 this is
right to the text now when we save it
here's the difference
so we have our h1 tag which is left
aligned and let me minimize this for you
guys alright so we have this is red
which is our h1 on our left alignment we
have the centered text which is the h2
tag which is Center aligned and we
finally have h3 tag which is right
aligned and we also have a fourth value
to our text alignment so let's create a
paragraph tag and text alignment we just
by now what does this do justify takes
each line within that element and it is
going to ensure that each line is of the
same width so let me show you what I
mean square the paragraph and this is
para I don't know okay I'll just copy
this and paste it a couple of times
doesn't matter how many unless it's
multiple lines all right now what this
does is when you refresh it it ensures
that each line is of the same width so
it ends at the same position and it also
starts at the same position so each line
within the paragraph element now the
paragraph tag is going to have the same
width and this is something you're going
to be you would have already seen
newspapers or magazines where the text
is justified all right the next property
we have is letter spacing and that is
used to obviously space or specify the
space between letters so in our h1 tag
let's use letter spacing and let's say
10 pixels now this is going to space our
letters by inserting 10 pixels of space
between them so keep an eye on this is
red when i refresh it there you go a
whole lot of space between each
individual letter similarly we have word
spacing so word spacing and this is used
to specify the spacing between the words
let's say 50 pixels now this is read as
already far apart when i refresh it this
is our single word is a single word and
red is a single word and each one of
these words is 50 pixels apart from the
other that's how you specify spacing
between words finally we have line
height that is used to specify the
distance between or the spacing between
the lines so let
say 1.5 now what this does is it's going
to enter to you some space between these
two lines or the lines in the and in
there look within the element so keep an
eye on the paragraph when i refresh it
okay i used it for the h1 tag let me use
it for paragraph so that it's much more
evident save it keep an eye on this
paragraph and there you go now this is
kind of helpful when you write a
paragraph and look it looks all
cluttered and if if that is what you're
going for then you can have a completely
cluttered look by specifying a decimal
value and the sentences or the lines
just overlap on top of each other
great so that's pretty much what I have
for text properties we have a color to
specify a text color we have the text
alignment property to specify whether
there to be left aligned right aligned
or Center aligned we also have the
justify value which is going to ensure
that each line is of the same but we
also have letter spacing word spacing
and line height which is used to space
the letters the words and the lines
respectively so that's pretty much it
yep thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
