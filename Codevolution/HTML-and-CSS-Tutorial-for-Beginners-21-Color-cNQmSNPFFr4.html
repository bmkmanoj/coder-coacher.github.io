and in this video we are going to be
learning the various ways that we can
specify a color to an HTML element now
the first way the first method is using
the color keyword that we will already
learnt so let's say we have an h1 tag
that we want to have an red color so we
use the h1 selector within the pair of
bracket we're going to be using the
color keyword and then specifying red as
the value and within a body tag we can
create an h1 tag that says this is CSS
and when you save it and refresh it you
get this a CSS in red color so by using
the color keyword and an appropriate
color we are able to assign color to our
HTML elements and the second one or the
second way of assigning a color is using
a hexadecimal value now this has a pound
or a pound sign or a hash symbol
followed by six hexadecimal value so if
you want a red color it is going to be
rgb2 digits or two characters for each
of the red green and blue color now FF
is going to have a red color okay it's
already read if you want to change it to
green then change the middle 22 F and
there you go this is CSS in green color
now you can have any combination of
hexadecimal values if you just go to
google and type hexadecimal color code
for HTML you'll get a whole bunch of
colors that you can use and the third
way is using the RGB probably so the
color is going to be RGB and this RGB is
going to take three parameters the first
one is for the red color so let's say we
don't want red
we want a blue color so the red is going
to be zero a green is going to be zero
and the maximum value of 255 for blue
color so r is represented by the first
parameter green by the second and blue
by the third now when we save it and
refresh it we have this is CSS in blue
color now if you want a different shade
we can even combine it so 255 255 for
green and blue save it you get a new
color of blue and then you can add a bit
of red let's say 128 save it refresh it
and then you get another shade of blue
so yeah that's pretty much the different
ways that we can apply color to our HTML
tags so thank you guys for watching your
favorite subscribe and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
