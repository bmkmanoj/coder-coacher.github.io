from where we left off I have a couple
of more points on object literals and
the first one being in es2015
it is possible to have spaces in object
properties so let's say we have a person
object then we can have a property with
first space name but the only condition
is you need to enclose this and double
codes so we can have first name assign
to Chandler but now when we log it we
cannot use the dot notation we instead
have to use square brackets and within
the square brackets it is going to
contain this exact same string so a
person of first name now let's save this
go to your browser and there you go we
have the first name which is Chandler
over here now the second thing is we can
also use variables as property names so
let me create a new property let L m and
this can be equal to a string last name
and over here in a person object we can
use this variable as a property name so
Ellen can be used as a property name but
again the only condition is you need to
enclose it within square brackets so we
can have Ln colon in pink and that we
could which is a string so we're here
let me just change person first name to
just person so that we can have a look
at the object let's save this and there
we go we have an object first name is
Chandler and last name is Bing it's a
first name which was already specified
and l-n got substituted with this value
right here last name so last name so
cute things to keep in mind from this
video we can have spaces in object
properties and we can also use variable
names for substituting with probably
names
and that's about it for object literals
next video another great feature called
restructuring so thank you guys for
watching and really subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
