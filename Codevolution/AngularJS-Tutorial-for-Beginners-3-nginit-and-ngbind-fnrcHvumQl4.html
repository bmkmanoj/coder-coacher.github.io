have a look at some more directives the
first one is the ng init directive which
is used to initialize angular
application data so let us see how to
initialize two variables a and B which
represent a sides of a rectangle and
calculate its area and your body tag
type ng in it as equal to a which is
equal to Phi and B is equal to 6 and
under our script tag go ahead and use a
paragraph tag type the area is length
times read so a star B what we have done
is use the ng in the directive to
initialize two variables a and B with
the values 5 and 6 and then use an
expression to evaluate this so go ahead
and save it now when you reload the page
the browser you get the area as 30
now the second director we are going to
learn about as the ng bind director the
ng bind directive has a similarly
function similar functionality to an
expression let us see how create a new
paragraph tag and type the area s and
instead of using the expression this
time let us make use of the ng ng bind
directive specifies a span tag and as an
attribute type and she mind is equal to
this time you specify what data you want
to bind and display in the HTML page so
this is going to be the area so it is
again a star B so a star B go ahead and
save it so when you reload the page we
have the area as 30 the area is 30 so we
see that the expression and the ng bind
have a similar functionality
no it's not necessarily numeric values
that we can initialize we can also
initialize string or an array or even
objects let us see a few examples let us
go ahead and initialize a string so
first name is equal to a string so codes
and the first name is Chandler and
secondly or the last name is equal to
Bank then close now instead of typing
that area let's say paragraph tag I'm
going to say full name yes
Kathleen plus you're going to
concatenate the first name and the last
name to display the full name so the
first name plus the last name it's going
to give the full name similarly let us
use the ng bind directive as well so
full name is span and then ng bind is
equal to Earth name plus single coat
plus our name go ahead and save it when
you reload the page full name is
Chandler Bing full name is Chandler Bing
now we can also use an array so let us
type a new array X is equal or even
numbers maybe even is equal to 2 4 6 8
and we can have
alright let's just remove the text could
directly have the value so if I type X
off to and and this ng bind directive
again if I type X off one go ahead and
save it reloaded I've done some mistake
so we have X of 2 sorry
even of 2 and we have even of 1 save it
reload it get 6 and 4 so even of 2 is 6
because it starts with an index of 0 0 1
2 so even if 2 is 6 and even if one is 4
so that's how that's that's pretty much
it about entry in it an ng bind director
