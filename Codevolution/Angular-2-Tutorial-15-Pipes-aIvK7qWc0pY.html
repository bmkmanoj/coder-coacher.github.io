we are going to be learning about the
pipe operator so in angular pipes are
used to transform expressions to a
desired format for example we can have a
string converted to an upper case or a
lower case we can have the date in a
particular format we can have the
decimals or the number in a particular
format so we can even have custom pipes
to have a desired format so in this
video let us have a look at some of the
built-in transformations on these data
types so the first one is we are going
to have a property called name and let's
assign it a string so let's have the
Jomon over here in our template let's
have an h2 tag close the h2 tag use
interpolation to display this name so
let's save this and if you have a look
at a browser then name the joke man is
displayed now let us see what are the
transformations we can apply on our name
property so I'm going to copy this okay
so to apply a transformation we use the
pipe operator over here and this pipe
operator on the left-hand side is going
to have the expression 2 which we need
to apply the transformation to and on
the right hand side we are going to
specify the transformation or the
desired format so the first one is
uppercase so when we use the upper clip
uppercase pipe all the letters are going
to be transformed to uppercase now
similarly we are going to have a
lowercase so let's copy this let me
change this to lowercase and when we
save and refresh our browser we are
going to have everything in the lower
case now the next one is a slice pipe so
what slice does is it is going to
extract
a substring or it is going to have
substring out of the original string and
this takes argument to specify an
argument you use the colon and single
codes and you can specify the starting
index so if I say 2 and save this it is
going to start from index 2 till the end
of the string so 0 1 0 1 2 so E is index
2 and it is going to display till the
end of the string now you can also limit
by using a second parameter so this is
the ending index so let me say 4 and it
is going to display up to but not
including index 4 so from index 2 to
index 3 but not including 4 so over here
if you have a look
it starts at index 2 includes index 3
but not index 4 so we have the substring
ej now the last one we can apply to our
name as the replace pipe so instead of
so let's say we have though over here in
the Joad month that we want to be
replaced by hello so replace again takes
two arguments the first one is the
pattern that you want to replace and the
second one is the pattern that you want
to replace it with so if you save this
and the browser is reloaded it is going
to say hello Jomon so these are some of
the transformations that you can apply
on a string so let me just clear this
out so that we can move on to numbers so
let me create a simple number eight
point five six seven so over here what
are some of the transformations you can
apply so h2 and close h2 so ctrl C
control-v so the first one is actually
the format is the same for everything
but we are going to have a look at the
different formats we can are the
different outputs we can have from the
same format so we are going to be using
the number keyword and we are going to
be specifying one particular format so
this is what is the minimum number of
integer digits you need to have so let's
say 1 and after the decimal point what
are the minimum number of decimal digits
you want to have let's say 2 and what
are the maximum number of decimal digits
that you can have let's say 3 so what we
mean to say here is towards the left of
this decimal point I need at least one
number and towards the right I need at
least two numbers but I can also have a
maximum of three numbers so when you
save this so we have eight point five
six seven and eight point five six seven
so there's no real difference over here
but let me change the values so that you
can have a look at what the new output
is going to be so let's say we need a
minimum of two integer digits or two
digits before this decimal point so what
happens then is that it is going to add
an extra zero to the left of eight so we
have at least two digits before the
integer point of the decimal point now
similarly we can have let's say ctrl-c
and ctrl-v if we change if you say that
we need a minimum of four decimal points
and a maximum of four so when you save
this and the browser is reloaded then we
are going to have a zero on the right
hand side of the decimal point so as to
not alter the value so minimum of four
digits on the right hand side now
finally we can have let's copy this and
paste it we can have minimum of two
digits with a maximum of two digits as
well so what happens here is that it is
going to round off this
value so okay I have five six seven but
you want only two decimal points two
decimal digits so I'm going to round off
the six seven to a five seven so zero
eight point five seven will be the value
so that's pretty much it about number
transformations but you can also have a
number as a currency in angular so we
have a currency pipe so let's create H -
H - and over here
let's have interpolation and let's have
it's eight point nine nine so if you
want to have it as a currency then we
use the currency pipe and then it takes
an argument so if you want it to be in
Euros we specify e you are so when you
save it it is going to display euro
eight point nine nine or if you want we
can have US dollars so save this and it
is going to save us D eight point nine
nine now but now if you want to have its
respective symbol instead of this string
then we have we can specify a second
parameter with the value true and when
you save this it is going to replace us
D with the dollar sign now similarly I
can have the Great Great Britain pound
so when you save this it is going to
have pounds eight point nine nine so
these are the Quincy transformations and
finally we can have date transformations
so let me quickly remove over here so
that we can make way for our date
transformations let's create a property
called date this is equal to new date
and now let's use interpolation to bind
date property so when you save this and
the page is reloaded we are going to
have the current date so Tuesday May 24
2016 Indian Standard time so but many a
times this is not the desired format we
would want
displayed this is a huge string so what
we would do is use some day
transformations so let me create a new
one so the date is going to have date as
the pipe keyword and then we can have
full date so full date not double date
so full date and when you refresh it it
is going to display a full date which is
which is just going to say Tuesday May
24 2016 now similarly we can have a
couple more formats so let me quickly
show that to you the next one would be
short date and we can also have a medium
time there are a couple of them and you
can go to the angular website to check
what is the desired value you want to
have but this is the short date which
just gives you the days date in the
numeric format and it gives you the
current time if you have medium time or
if you want to have a short time to a
short time save it and this is going to
refresh it's going to just say 743 p.m.
so there are a couple of them please go
to the angular website if you want all
the format's but the basic idea was to
explain to you how to use them so this
is a recap we have upper case lower case
slice and replace for a string datatype
we have a number pipe for our numeric
and then we can apply currency for
transformations and finally Drake date
transformations so that's pretty much it
about the pipe operator thank you guys
for watching
