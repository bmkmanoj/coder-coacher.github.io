Mongo sure let's get started
the first thing we want to do is open
command prompt and type Mongo D now this
is going to run Mongo D in the
background and we wait for connections
on port two seven zero one seven next
thing is go to more Musha refine connect
click on new connection and to terry old
that's the name the server is local host
and port is two seven zero one seven
click on save and connect now we have
connected
alright now click on until I show now
until I shall is something similar to
Mongo shell that we saw and command
prompt but it's much more easier to use
and now before we get started with the
commands just a quick explanation of the
structure of the database in MongoDB so
we have a database each database is made
up of related data called collections
and each collection has the actual data
called document so a database can have
one or more collections and each
collection can have one or more
documents don't worry if it's consumed
confusing right now and get better as we
move on with the tutorials now some
basic commands the first one is how to
create a database so the command is use
and then the database name so use test
DB and we click on execute at cursor so
it says switched to BB test DB now how
the command use works is if testdb
doesn't exist it is going to create test
TV but if it already exists let's just
going to switch to that to that
particular database now to check what is
the current database we are end just
type DB DB and execute
so it says test dB so the DB command is
used to check what database we are
currently working with now the third
command is show TBS the sure device is
used to list all the databases that we
have so show do is if I run with the
cursor it's going to say local now local
is the database that is provided by
default but we did create a database
called test TV where is that now in mock
oh we need to insert a document in the
database for that to be listed so the
command to create a document is DV dot I
need to give a collection name because
documents belong in collections so test
collection dot insert and let's just put
some data and let's say name test now
what this command is saying is please
insert this document inside this
collection inside the current database
so when we go ahead and execute that
right result so one document was
inserted now when we go ahead and say
show DB's and execute that so we have
tested so just want to remember you need
to have a document inside database we
should've is to list that particular
database now the final command is how to
delete a database but the command is DB
dot draw database now what this does is
okay we were in the current DB called
teste we please drop that DB when you
execute that dropped and it was okay and
that particular database would still eat
now if we go ahead and say show TVs and
run this it says look so we don't have
the test TV anymore so that's how you
create and drop databases in MongoDB
thank you for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
