number 33 of the HTML CSS series now so
far we have been writing tags one below
the other and in the browser they appear
in the exact same way one below the
other but using CSS it is possible to
position the elements according to our
liking and the reverse type of
positioning we are going to be learning
about is the relative positioning so
let's create two simple paragraphs this
is paragraph 1 and then this is
paragraph 2 when we save it and reload
our HTML page we have paragraph 1 and
paragraph 2 exactly have the appear in
our HTML file I'm going to specify a
relative positioning let's start by
creating a class since we've already
learned about the class selector let's
start making use of that one so dot and
then followed by the class name so let's
call this arielle POS short for relative
positioning now to specify a position we
use the position property and since this
is relative positioning it is going to
take a value of relative relayed to now
there are two more properties we can
specify first one as top let's say this
is how much we 100 pixels and left let
this be 100 pixels as well and i'll
explain in just a moment what that means
ok so let's add this dot arielle p.o.s
to our first paragraph so a class is
equal to arielle POS so we're going to
apply this style to our first paragraph
now closely observe we have this is
paragraph 1 over here when you refresh
it there you go this is paragraph 1 has
shifted white hundred pixels
from the top and 100 pixels from the
left and where exactly did it shift from
it shifted from its original position or
that's how relative positioning works so
we have this paragraph one which was
over here over paragraph two and we see
that shift 100 pixels from the top and
100 pixels from the left from the
relative to the position that you were
originally n so okay paragraph one was
about paragraph two so from that
position shift 100 pixels to the bottom
or 100 pixels from the top and hundred
pixels from the left and it's going to
end up in this position so that's how
relative positioning works in the next
video let us learn about absolute
positioning so thank you guys for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
