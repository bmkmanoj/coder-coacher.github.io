number 19
so in es 2015 we have string templates
which offer a convenient way to work
with strings so in this video let us
have a look at string templates let's
start off by creating a simple variable
so that user is equal to Chandler and
let's say we want to greet a Chandler so
let greet as equal to welcome and then
in JavaScript we would use plus for
string concatenation so we would say
user and then again a plus and then we
would say two es2015
then if you go ahead and lock this on to
our console we would have welcome
Chandler to es2015
now however with a string template we
can eliminate this plus character for
concatenation so I'm going to start off
by replacing this double codes with
practice so now what is a backtick the
backtick is the key below escape and
above the tab key so go ahead and
replace that and now we can eliminate
these plus characters so if you want to
use a value that is assigned to a
variable within a string we can use the
dollar and wrap the variable name within
curly braces so now the value Chandler
is going to get interpolated over here
in this user variable so let's save this
we see that our output still remains the
same now another important use of this
string template is it allows us to use
single quotes and double quotes within
the string so now we can have single and
we can also have double and we don't
have to worry about messing up the
string syntax so let's save this and
there you go we have the single codes
and the double codes so this comes in
really handy sometimes and another
feature of string templates which is of
great help
during angular2 while writing hTML is
that it supports multi-line strings so
now we can have multiple lines without
having to use the string concatenation
so over here I can say this is the
second line and then I would say third
and so on so let's save this and see
what the output is there you go we have
multiple lines of strings outputted to
the console but be careful
because when you use backticks white
spaces are significant if you see the
amount of white spaces over here they
get out put it onto the console in the
same way so there is something to keep
in mind when working with backticks so
that is going to be it about string
templates thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
