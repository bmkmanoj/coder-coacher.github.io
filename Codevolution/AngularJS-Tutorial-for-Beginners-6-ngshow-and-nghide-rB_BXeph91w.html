a bit more about controllers and a few
new directives now in a raptor GS we
have created a controller called my
controller and in our index dot HTML we
have specified my controller using the
energy controller director let us go
ahead and create some data in our
controller so dollar Scoob dog first
name is equal to Chandler and we can
also have dollar scope dot last name is
equal to pink
now go ahead and save it if you want to
make the data available in our index dot
HTML you can always use expressions so
if paragraph tag first name is first
name the expression is going to bind the
value and another paragraph tag last
name is last name when we go ahead and
save it go ahead and save a PS go to
your browser reload it says first name
is Chandler the last name is Bing now in
our controllers it is also possible to
specify functions let us see how create
a new scope dot full name but this time
assign it a function now the function is
going to return the concatenation of the
first name and the last name so dollar
Scoob God first name plus dollar Scoob
dog last night save it go back to your
index page create a new paragraph tag
but it says full plain as user next
question type full name
what's it this time since we have used a
function you also need to specify
parentheses so once we specify
parentheses go ahead and save it reload
it you get full name is Chandler Bing
now that's similar information on
controllers let's have a look at some
more directives now let us say a
Chandler can be a spy so we can have
something called taller scope dot is spy
and you can set it equal to true and if
he is a spy we're also going to have a
codename
dalla scope dots codename is equal to
let's say chancy go ahead and save it
now let's see let us display the
codename as well you know index dot HTML
- paragraph tag code name is code name
go ahead and save it reload the browser
and say his code name is Chauncey now
when we have Chandler who goes on a
mission with a code name he doesn't want
his first name last name or full name to
be displayed he only wants his code name
to be shown now how do we do this how do
we show some data but hide rest of the
data that we're going to be using the
ng-show and ng-hide directives let us
see how good your index dot HTML now we
have our scope dot is quite true now if
he is a spy then we should just display
the code name so within the paragraph
tag type and she show as equal to his
spy now this means to say that show the
code name only
when he is a spy and we also need to
hide first name last name full name when
he's a spy so ng-hide is equal to his
spy can repeat the same for the last
name and the full name so ng-hide is
equal to a spy
similarly ng hi is equal to a spy go
ahead and save it and when we reload our
page says only code name is Chauncey so
we learn three things in a controller it
is possible to use functions and we have
returned the full name which is a
concatenation of first name and last
name next one is a directive called
ng show which is going to show a
particular HTML element
based on a condition and we also use ng
hide which is going to hide certain
elements based on the condition now we
have set a spy to true
so ng show is evaluated to true and code
name is displayed the first name last
name and full name however the ng-hide
evaluates to true and is going to hide
the first name last name and falling
anyway thank you for watching next video
let us learn about filters and I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
