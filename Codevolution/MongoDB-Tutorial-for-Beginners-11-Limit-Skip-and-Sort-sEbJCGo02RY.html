have a look at some more operations on
document now the first run as usual is
DV dot employees dot v dot pretty
so this retrieves it documents and all
the data in each of document now let us
go ahead and select only the employee
number and first name from each of the
document the tv-tv dot employees don't
find dot pretty this time we specify the
criteria there what selection fields now
nothing new everything is there in the
previous tutorial first name one and
employee number one and ID zero so when
we run this we get only the employee
number and first name from each of the
documents now suppose we want to limit
the number of documents retrieved to
fight so what we're going to do is copy
this command paste it and say dark limit
five so this is going to limit the
number of selected documents only to
five so as we can see here we have only
five documents now what if we want to
skip the first three documents and
display the remaining so DV don't find
selection quite the conditions for the
fields let's just say skip three what
this does what this does is it escapes
the first three fields and then selects
the remaining fields sorry the documents
that skip the first three documents and
selects the remaining documents
now finally we can all to say okay skip
the first three documents after skipping
three documents limit the selection to
just three more documents so it selects
the employee number and first name from
all the documents and then skips the
first three documents so one two three
is skipped and add a four five six seven
eight
select only three documents through four
five and six the last operation is
sorting so when we have to sort based on
a particular field let's just go ahead
and copy this again so do be that find
it pretty now say we want to sort based
on the first name so dot sort and we say
first name one now one mid sort in
descending order and minus one means
sort in the descending order say control
enter
all right we already have and river and
crest we already have it in the
ascending order now if you say minus one
it is occurring to sort in the
descending order so the first one is
Hanna charged Felicia and all the way
down to Andrew so this is how you limits
kept sort documents thank you for
watching I'll see you the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
