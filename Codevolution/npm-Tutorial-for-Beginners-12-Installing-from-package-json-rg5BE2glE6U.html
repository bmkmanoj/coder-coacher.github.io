for example let's say a project that you
found on github if you have a look at
the readme file it tells you the first
run the npm install command and this is
the typical usage because when you do
run npm install all the packages are
listed as dependencies in your package
dot JSON file get installed in the in
the local project folder for example
let's say that our project depends on
lodash so if i open command prompt in
our project folder which is npm and run
npm install it is first going to create
a node modules folder within our project
folder and if I go inside it is going to
create this lodash folder and this is
where our package files are going to
recite and npm install is probably the
most common command you're going to be
looking at when installing your
dependencies now
we also learned about semantic
versioning in the last video so let's
see how the version might be specified
in the package.json file now the most
common type you will come across is a
version with a caret symbol at the
beginning this right here and what this
specifies is stick to the given major
version number of four but when you run
NPM install retrieve the latest minor
and patch versions for example we might
have a version of 4.1 4.1 when ordering
our project development but let's say a
month or two later we might have four
point one five point one or four point
one six point one and so on so when we
do run npm install i need the latest
minor and patch versions and in fact
this is exactly what happened when they
did run npm install so although we
specified 4.1 4.1 it installed 4.1 6.1
so four was left as it is but the latest
version four minor and patch version
numbers were
and hence we installed low - package at
version 4.1 6.1 now the second type is
to specify the tilt instead of the caret
so when I specify the tilt symbol it
means to say leave the major version and
the minor version as it is but retrieve
the latest version of patch number when
I run NPM install command so let's see
our package JSON file and run NPM
install again so when I run NPM install
if you have a look 4.1 6.1 was our
previous version installed but this time
it is going to be 4.1 4.2 that is
because the tilt symbol is going to
restrict upgrading the major and minor
versions so only the patch version was
updated to the list to the latest one
and finally we can just have the
specific version number in which case
NPM doesn't install a newer version even
though it exists for example let's say I
specifically want 4.1 4.1 and not a
higher version so now let me save that
and when I run NPM install instead of
4.1 6.1 or 4.1 4.2 it is going to
install 4.1 4.1 so specific version I
don't need and I don't need a latest
version so that's how it's going to
install it and finally let's say even if
there is a change in the major version
number I want the latest one so we're
going to specify star so when we specify
star it is going to retrieve the latest
version of lodash irrespective of the
major minor or patch versions so that is
it about package versioning with NPM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
