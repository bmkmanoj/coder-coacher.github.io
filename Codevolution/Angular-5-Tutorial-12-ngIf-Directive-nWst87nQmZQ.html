structural directives structural
directives are directives that let you
add or remove HTML elements from the Dom
and we are going to learn about the
three common built in structural
directives namely ng-if ng switch and ng
for the first two directives that is ng
if and ng-switch are used to
conditionally render HTML elements
whereas the ng for directive is used to
render a list of HTML elements let's
take a look at the ng-if directive in
this video let's go back to visual
studio code and you can see that I have
created a new project called structural
directives again I've added a test
component and within the test component
we have an h2 tag in the template that
says code evolution and let's say we
want to use the ng-if directive on this
h2 tag so within the opening tag use an
asterisk and then ng-if to this we need
to assign a truth e or false e value
let's begin with a straightforward true
so now if we save this and take a look
at the browser we can see code evolution
and if I inspect the element you can see
the h2 tag within this app test HTML tag
now back in our code if I change true to
false save this and take a look at the
browser code evolution is not visible
anymore and what you need to keep in
mind is that the h2 element is removed
from the Dom itself so in the elements
panel you cannot identify h2 tag with an
app test
HTML element and this is different from
setting the CSS display property to none
in which case you will still be able to
see the element in the Dom all right
this is the basic usage of ng-if
directive star ng-if assign a truthy or
faulty value and that conditionally
renders that particular HTML element
however setting true or false on the
right-hand side
is of not much use so let's assign a
property value instead I'm going to
create a new property called display
name and set it to true and to the
directive I'm gonna assign display name
now if you save this and take a look at
the browser you can see code evolution
and if I change display name to false
code evolution is not displayed anymore
so now by making use of a property we
can add or remove the element in the Dom
by toggling this display name between
true and false and that can be done
easily with button clicks or any other
events but the bottom line is you have
more control over rendering this
particular h2 element now a common thing
to have with an if block is an else
block so let's take a look at an example
to see how to implement an else block
for the ng-if directive now I'm going to
add a new h2 tag that says name is
hidden so basically if display name is
set to true I want code evolution to be
displayed else I want name is hidden to
be displayed and here's how you do it
bear with me for a couple of seconds and
I will explain what is going on first
I'm going to wrap this else part with an
angular specific HTML tag which is the
engi template tag next I'm going to
reference this ng template tag with a
template reference variable let's call
this else block now back in the ng F
director I'm going to add a semicolon
and then else followed by the ng
template reference which is else block
so let me explain how this works
first it checks if display name is true
if it is true the element to which the
ng-if directive is attached will be
rendered in the dawn if display name is
false however angular checks if there is
an else statement
in our case we do now it checks which
HTML element needs to be rendered in our
case it is the else block and what is
the else block it is a reference to this
block of HTML the ng template tag is
basically like a container for other
elements that the ng-if directive can
use to properly add or remove locks of
HTML from the Dom so when execution
flows to the else condition this block
of code will be rendered in the screen
so if we save this and take a look at
the browser you can see that name is
hidden which is the else block in our
example is rendered in the browser
alright next let's take a look at
another syntax that angular provides for
the ng-if directive now if you notice
the directive is in line with the HTML
block that needs to be conditionally
rendered but with the alternate syntax
you can have the directive in a separate
tag so let me show you an example first
I'll create the if block and the else
block that has to be rendered and again
we use the ng template tag now for the
if block I've given a template reference
variable of then block and for the else
block I've given a reference variable
else block let's add HTML to both these
blocks code evolution for the if block
hidden for the else block now we can add
a new HTML tag that contains the ng-if
directive so let's add a div tag and
then the ng-if directive so star and she
if to this we assign a value and this is
going to be display name now after this
we are going to add a semicolon followed
by the keyword then and then then block
semicolon again else else block and
here's how you read it if display name
is true then render then
blog else render else block so right now
our display name is set to false so the
else block will be rendered so if we go
back to the browser you can see that
hidden is displayed and if I change
display name to true and take a look at
the browser again you can see code
evolution is now displayed well that is
how you use the ng-if directive in the
next video let's take a look at the
ng-switch directive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
