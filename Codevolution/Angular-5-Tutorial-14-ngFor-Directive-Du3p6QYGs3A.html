how to conditionally render elements in
this video let's take a look at the ng4
directive which helps us to render a
list of elements again the ng4 directive
is pretty much like the for loop in any
programming language the only difference
is that here we render HTML instead of
executing some logic so let's understand
the usage with an example first I'm
going to create a new property this is
going to be public colors equal to an
array of colors red blue green and
yellow using the ng4 directive let's
render a heading tag for each one of
these colors in the array and here's the
syntax I'm going to begin with a
container tag like div for example and
to the div tag we attach the ng4
directive and this directive again
begins with an asterisk and on the right
hand side let color of colors now here
colors is nothing but our data source
which is the array of colors and then we
declare a variable using the left
keyword which is a es2015 feature and
then the variable name is color so color
will refer to each item in the array
during the iteration next within the div
tag we can have the h2 tag where we bind
the color using interpolation so here is
how this syntax works it finds colors
which is the data source for the loop in
each iteration of the loop color refers
to one item in the array first iteration
it is red second iteration it is blue
third green and the last iteration it is
yellow and for each of these values the
h2 tag gets rendered so if we save this
and take a look at the browser you can
see the list of colors red blue green
and yellow now we can also extend the
same
to access the index during each
iteration so we're here put a semicolon
and then index as I and then bind the
alias I in the h2 tag so now if we save
this and take a look at the browser you
can see the index along with the colors
keep in mind the index will start from
zero all right now just like the index
we also get a couple more keywords to
use specific to the ng4 directive I can
say first as F and then bind F now this
will indicate if the element is the
first element in the array or not so if
we save this and take a look at the
browser it says true followed by three
false so this is the first element in
the array but the other three are not
similarly we can also have last as L and
then bind L now this outputs true for
the last element in the iteration so if
we save this and take a look at the
browser it says true for the very last
item which is yellow but for the first
three items
it says false and just like first and
last we can also have odd and even
indications so if I start with art as oh
and then bind o you can see that it says
true for odd items in the iteration so
remember this is 0 1 2 3 so 1 &amp;amp; 3 are
true which are odd but 0 &amp;amp; 2 are false
which are even so if I change odd to
even so even as II and then bind II save
this and take a look at the browser it
says true false true false 0 &amp;amp; 2 are
true whereas index 1 and 3 are false now
basically you might want to use the
ng-if directive coupled with these first
last odd and even values maybe to set a
specific class or a style or add and
remove elements from the DOM
all right so that is it about the ng4
directive thank you guys for watching
note where to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
