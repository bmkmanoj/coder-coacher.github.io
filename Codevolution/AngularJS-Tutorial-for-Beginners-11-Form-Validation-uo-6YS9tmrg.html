form validations it just so happens that
angularjs comes with a set of built-in
client cell validations that can be
really useful for us now let us go to
our browser and see some of the unusual
stuff that we can do with our current
form now let us type out a review hey
there and let us not specify any email
and you click on add review that if you
get saved when we leave out the comment
blank and type a valid email address and
click on add review just even get saved
now when we have an invalid email
address and click on add review the
browser comes up with its own validation
so what we want to do with our review
form is to submit only when there is a
valid comment and a valid email address
let us see how to do that now index dot
HTML the first thing we are going to do
is add the new validate attribute to our
form tag now what this attribute does is
disable all browser validations that
usually happens on the HTML second thing
we are going to specify a required
attribute to our form controls so for
our comment as well as our author or
email we are going to specify the
required attribute and go ahead and save
it if you reload our page if you type or
ABC
ASD it's gonna add review well it's
still it's still submitting the review
we don't want that now angle of GS comes
up with a property called valid for a
form that is used to specify the status
of the form to be either valid or
invalid now let us see how we can use a
we can make use of that
specify a break tag after the submit
button and type in the paragraph tag
form valid the question mark and our
expression you're going to type review
form dot dollar valid now review form is
the name of our form that we are
currently using and valid as a property
of the form now when we go ahead and
save it and reload it we see here that
the form valid is false
currently the form is valid sorry
invalid because we don't have a comment
or we don't have an email now if we go
ahead and type a comment hey there and
type a valid email address keep an eye
on how false changes to true so ABC at
email comm you see that now we can make
use of this to prevent the user from
submitting an invalid review so in our
ng submit type review form dot dollar
valid and add review now what this does
is if the form is a valid form then it
is going to allow us to add a review
however if the review is invalid one it
is going to prevent us from adding the
review let's go ahead save it
reload it now let's have an invalid form
so tada and we have an invalid email
address so currently the form is invalid
when we click on add review the review
does not get added but we can still add
a valid one add review and Ruby gets
added now even though we can prevent the
user from adding a review we still have
to inform them what is the element that
is preventing
from submitting the submitting the
review so if we go back to HTML file we
have to make use of classes that angular
provides and the first one is ng Ralad
the second one is energy invalid the
third one ng pristine and finally ended
early now initially if we consider our
email input control the class is going
to be initially the class is going to be
invalid and it's going to be pristine
now once we start typing an email
address and if it is an invalid email
address then it is going to be a class
of invalid but this time the class would
have changed to dirty now once you type
a valid email address the class
automatically changed changes to Ralad
and dirty now we can make use of these
classes to inform our user what is the
troublesome element first let us go
ahead and include some CSS in our head
tag go ahead and type style text as type
as text last CSS and let us make use of
the classes we just defined so dot ng
invalid and ng dirty then I'm going to
specify a border color of red
now if we have and she valid and ng
dirty then let's have a border color
water color of green this means to say
that if you have an invalid entry let us
highlight it with the red color and if
we have in in well if you have a valid
entry let us highlight it with the green
color that is all so go ahead and type
input text area and give it a border Oh
two pixel solid just so that we can make
out now go ahead and save it
reload it we have a border now once we
start typing check out the comment and
email address change the border there is
green now in our email address we can
see all the differences if you start
typing invalid email so the border
automatically changes to red and if we
type a valid email address valid at
email comm it changes to green this way
we can inform our user what is causing
them from preventing to submit the form
now since a form is valid you go ahead
and submit it so that's pretty much all
about form validations or at least the
basics that you need to know thank you
