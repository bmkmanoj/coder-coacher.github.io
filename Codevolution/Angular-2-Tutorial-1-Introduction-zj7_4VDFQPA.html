to a brand new tutorial series on
angular 2 now throughout this video
series we are going to be learning the
major concepts in angular 2 but this
video however is just a quick
introduction now before I start let me
tell you that it is completely fine if
you don't know anything in angular 1
because I'm going to be explaining from
the basics and a lot has changed from
angular 1 to angular 2 now you do
however need to know HTML CSS and
JavaScript so let's get started what is
angular 2 and why is it used angular is
one of the more popular frameworks for
building applications that rely heavily
on JavaScript now it's a platform to
develop mobile and web applications and
angular is mainly used to build single
page applications so what are single
page applications now let's say you have
a website and when you click on a button
or a link and to just display a small
portion of the website the entire web
page is reloaded in single page
applications however only that portion
of the web page is refreshed or reloaded
so this is going to improve the speed
and performance of your application now
we can also build unit testable code and
we can also write code that is reusable
which is going to expedite our
development so if your aim is to build
modular applications that are easy to
test and maintain then angular 2 is a
great choice and angular is a work in
progress by both Google and Microsoft so
it's going to be one of the more popular
things and the coming future so it's a
great thing to learn so that's pretty
much it for the introduction video in
the next video let us understand the
architecture of angular 2 so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
