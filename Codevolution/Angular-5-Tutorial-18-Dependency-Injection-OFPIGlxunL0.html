to learn about dependency injection now
here's the thing we can start writing
the code for angular services without
diving deep into dependency injection
but as always I want to help you get a
better understanding of the code that
you write and maintain so we are going
to learn about the AI in three parts
first we will take a look at the code
that does not use di and also take a
look at its drawbacks next I will
explain the AI as a design pattern and
how it overcomes the drawbacks finally I
will talk about di as a framework that
angular provides so let's begin with
some code that doesn't use di so
consider three classes one for a car one
for an engine and one for tires for
simplicity let's assume we only need an
engine and few tires to build a car so a
car has two dependencies engine and
tires in the car class the constructor
itself creates copies of the engine and
tires so when you instantiate a new car
the constructor instantiates a new
engine and new tires simple enough right
but there's a problem with this code
let's assume the engine evolves and its
constructor can now accept a parameter
maybe the engine type like petrol or
diesel but when we change the engine our
car is broken to repair our car class we
need to pass in a parameter to the
engine constructor similarly if the
tires class accepts a new parameter the
car class needs to be fixed again so our
very first drawback is our code is not
flexible anytime the dependencies change
the car class needs to be changed as
well the sake
drawback is that this coat is not
suitable for testing
anytime you instantiate a new car you
get the same engine and the same set of
tires
what if you want to test our code maybe
with a petrol engine a diesel engine new
tires old tires and so on it's not
possible even if we were able to do it
by changing code what do we do if the
engine and tires in turn have some
dependencies how do we keep track and
create those dependencies so basically
we are not in control of our code and
this is well the second part of our
video that is dependency injection as a
design pattern is going to help us let's
take a look at that now basically
dependency injection is a coding pattern
in which a class receives its
dependencies from external sources
rather than creating them itself so
let's take a look at code that makes use
of di and understand this definition now
if you see here we have moved the
definition of the dependencies from
inside the constructor to the parameters
of the constructor so the card class
doesn't create the dependencies anymore
it just consumes them the creation of
those dependencies is external to this
class and by doing so both the drawbacks
we had enough salt to create a car we
are going to have the code something
like this we first make an engine and
the tires and then pass them as
parameters when creating a car now even
if the engine evolves to take a
parameter there is no change in how we
make the car so you can see that the
engine now takes a parameter but the car
still accepts that engine without a
problem and same is the case with tires
even if the tires now take sin
there is no change in how we make the
car our code is much more flexible now
even if we make changes to the
dependencies the car class remains
intact and the same is applicable to
testing as well since we are in complete
control of the dependencies we can mock
the data to suit our testing needs for
example we can create an old engine an
old set of tires and test with an old
car or we can create a new engine a new
set of tires and test with a new car so
we can test for multiple scenarios using
this approach well that is about di as a
design pattern but now we have another
problem at hand with the AI we create a
car by passing the dependencies as
parameters but here's the thing we as
the developer have to create those
parameters first right now we just have
two dependencies so we are fine we
create the engine and the tires and then
pass it to the car but what if the car
had let's say 10 or 20 dependencies we
would have to create all those
dependencies before passing them as
parameters and what if those
dependencies in turn had dependencies on
something else then we would first need
to create those dependencies so as the
number of dependencies grow it becomes
really difficult to manage the code take
a look at this example we have a car
again but this time the car has multiple
dependencies it is dependent on engine
tires dependency a dependency B and so
on till dependency Z so we will have to
create all these dependencies ourselves
and if you have a look at the second car
it has a dependency z and depend
seesee is in turn dependent on
dependency a B so we will have to first
create dependency a B before creating
dependency z and eventually the car so
this becomes extremely difficult for a
developer and this is where angular's
dependency injection as a framework
comes into picture the BI framework has
something called an injector when you
register all your dependencies so the
injector is basically like a container
of all the dependencies like engines
tires dependency a B and so on so if you
want a car ask for a car and the
injector will provide a car for you the
framework will manage all the
dependencies so that you don't have to
keep track of it the DI framework makes
the developers job that much more easier
if we relate to our example our Employee
List component might be dependent on
service a b c and so on we register all
these dependencies or services with the
injector then when the employee list
component is initialized the injector
provides all the necessary depending
sees for the proper functioning of the
Employee List component so coming back
to where we left off in the last video
here is how you use a service in angular
the first step you create the service
and in our example it is the employee
service class the second step is to
register the service with anglers
built-in injector the last step is to
declare the service as a dependency in
the class that needs it in our case the
employee list and employee detail are
the classes that need the employee
service so pictorially here is how you
can represent it we have the injector
and with the injector we have registered
our employee service this employee
service will be provided
to the employee list component and the
employee detailed component so that is
about di as a framework in angular
now if the video was a bit too much
there is nothing to worry about I
recommend you go through the next video
take a look at the code and then come
back to this video for a much better
understanding alright in the next video
let's implement the steps to use a
service in angular thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
