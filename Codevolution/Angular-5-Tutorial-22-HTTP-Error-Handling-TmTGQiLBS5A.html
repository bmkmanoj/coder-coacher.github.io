look at handling HTTP errors in our
angular application
we know that an observable is returned
as a result of the HTTP call so to
handle exceptions on an observable we
make use of the catch operator
so let's first import the catch operator
import rxjs / add / operator
/ catch then we add the catch operator
on our observable dot catch the catch
operator takes in a method named as an
argument I'm going to call this this dot
error handler and this is the method
that gets called whenever there is an
exception so let's go ahead and define
the error handler method so ever handler
and this method has a parameter let's
call it error and this is of type HTTP
error response and make sure to import
it as well from angular / comment / HTTP
now if you notice the employee service
does not have a view of its own but it
is really important that our users be
informed of any exceptions that occur if
not they just end up staring at the
blank screen which is poor user
experience so what the error handler
method does is it throws out the error
message so that any component that has
subscribed to the observable can make
use of it and display the error in the
view so in the method body we return
observable dot throw and we throw the
error message which is the description
of the error or if it is null we just
throw a string server error and make
sure to import throw as well import our
exists / add / observable / throw
all right so the first half of error
handling is done we have caught the
exception on the observable and we have
thrown it to the components that have
subscribed to the observable the second
half is displaying the error message in
the components that have subscribed so
in the employee list component just like
how we get data we can also get an error
so the second argument to the SUBSCRIBE
method is also a phat error function but
this function deals with the error
scenario it takes error as an argument
and in the body we are going to say this
dot error message is equal to error and
let's create this error message property
and also bind it to our view using
interpolation so public error message
and then in the view just underneath
employee list we are going to bind it
and let's do the exact same change in
employee detail component as well okay
seems like I missed a comma then let's
go to employee detail component copy ng
on init method paste it create the error
message property and then bind it in the
view so now if I save this and take a
look at the browser you can see the
Employee List and employee details but
if I change the URL from employees dot
JSON to employees one dot JSON you
should be able to see the error message
HTTP failure response for localhost 4200
assets /data /resource is a 404 not
found error and that is what is
displayed in our UI alright so this is
the basic idea how to handle HTTP errors
in your angular application let me
quickly go over it one more time so that
you have a
better understanding the first step we
use the catch operator on the observable
if at all there is an error the error
handler method which is the argument to
the catch operator is executed from the
error handler method we just throw the
exception out in the components that
have subscribed to the observable we get
access to the data and the error if
there is no error we get the data assign
the data to the employee's array and
then display the list of employees
however if there is an error we get the
error instead assign it to the error
message property and then display the
error message in the view well that is
about services HTTP and observables in
