tables now sometimes when we are
creating tables we want some data to
take a more than either one row or one
column for example let's say that above
the first name of the last name we want
a single data called names to take up
the place to take up the space of two
columns and on the left hand side we
want cast to take up the space of all
these rows so let's see how to create
that in our HTML now whenever we want to
whenever we want some data to take up
multiple columns then we make use of the
column span or Co LSP am called span
attribute so create a neuro and within
this row we are going to create a single
TD or sorry let's go a th and this th is
going to have an attribute called sorry
about that call span and this time the
value is going to be the number of
columns that this data is supposed to
take now since we need to take two
columns let's specify two then we can
say name our names then we save it and
reload this we have one single names
that is taking up the space of two
columns and one other thing to notice
here is that when you use a th as
opposed to a TD it is usually in bold
and it is going to be Center aligned so
if you have a look over here first name
last name and names are bold and you
since it has more space over here you
can also identify that names is Center
aligned the next thing is we want to
create a cast on the left side that is
going to take up the space of all these
rows so let's create
another row on the very top so let's
create a row now this is that's going to
be another th and this is going to take
up all the rows and not the columns so
we are going to be using a row span
attribute now this row span is again
going to take the number of rows that
this particular pH should span through
now we have a total of one two three
four five six seven eight and including
the new rule we have just created there
are a total of nine rows that this
particular th should take up so let's
say cast over here with a row span
attribute of nine save it and if you
reload it we have cast on the left hand
side which is once again aligned
properly and it's bold so that's it
about the roast pan and column span
attributes thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe i'll see you in
the next video where we are going to
finally wind up with tables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
