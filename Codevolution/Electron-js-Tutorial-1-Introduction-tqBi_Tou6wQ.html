on electrons for beginners throughout
the series we will learn the different
concepts in electron and how to
implement them we will also create a
couple of useful applications using
electron now this video however is just
a quick introduction all right so what
is electron and why would you use it
electron is an open source framework
that is used to build cross-platform
desktop applications using web
technologies like HTML CSS and
JavaScript
now the question is why would you want
to build desktop applications well even
though a lot of web frameworks are out
there and a lot of things can be
achieved using them there are certain
drawbacks for example writing
conditional code because of browser
differences is always a pain for any
developer your code might work on Chrome
and Firefox but not Internet Explorer so
you have to add in that extra bit of
code every single dime the second one is
that access to file system is also
limited when working with web
technologies now we also run into the
problem of slow network connectivity
that has a negative impact on web
technologies and let's face it we have
great desktop applications that we use
on a daily basis ok so we understand
desktop applications are necessary but
why use web technologies to build
desktop applications to answer that
question I would say that the web
community is much bigger than the
desktop community so any support for
your applications you can find them
easily online and the second thing is
that anytime you build that some
applications you have to ensure that you
address the different platforms like
Windows or Mac OS to get that native
feel of the application with
technologies on the other hand a
cross-platform and that is why electron
was created so that we can use web
analogies to build desktop applications
but how does electrons achieve all this
well electrons is the combination of two
technologies chromium which is the open
source part of Chrome for you I display
and nodejs with a v8 engine for runtime
environment these two technologies
bundled together is nothing but electron
which can be used to create native
desktop applications an electron by
targeting codes only for this chromium
browser ensures that there are no
differences in the behavior of our code
the code runs the exact same way in all
platforms so now that you know what
electron is why it is used and how it
works let me go over the prerequisites
for this series first you need to be
familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS
this is for the UI then you also need to
know JavaScript which is the main
language for our application a bit of
knowledge on NPM and node.js is also
required and if you have no fue above
nodejs or npm feel free towards the
node.js or npm series on my channel and
then get started with electron alright
with this brief introduction to electron
let's get started with the hello world
desktop application in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
