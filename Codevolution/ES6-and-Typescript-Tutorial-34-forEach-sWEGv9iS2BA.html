number 34
I mean es5 we have the for each loop to
iterate over array elements so let's say
we have an array of numbers 2 4 6 8 then
we can call the for each loop on this
numbers array by passing a function this
function is going to accept 3 3
parameters the element of the array
index of the array and this array is the
array with which the for each loop was
called so we can log to the console
array of index element and we run this
we get AF 0 equals to 1 is 4 2 4 6 8 now
for each loop worked out pretty well in
es5 with arrays so in es2015 they
decided to have the for each loop with
maps and sets as well so let's have a
look at maps in yes 2015 I'm going to
comment this out and clear the console
so over here I have created a new map so
let my map equals new map and this
contains two key value pairs first name
Chandler and last name Bing now similar
to arrays we call the for each loop on
the on the map and we have a function
passed into the parentheses now this map
function is going to again accept three
parameters the value so Chandler and
bring the key first name last name and
then the calling map so the map on which
the for each method is called so let's
lock the console key value pair and then
let's check if my map is actually equal
to this calling map so when I run this
and head over to the console nothing's
working we check why okay so I need to
have the closing parenthesis and there
we go let's run this we have first name
Chandler my map is in fact equal to the
calling map and last name Bing
so that is how the for each loop works
with maps now similarly we also have the
for each loop with sets now I have
created a new set let my set equals new
set and it has three unique values 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 and again we are calling the for each
loop on my set by passing a function
called set function and the set function
is going to accept three parameters
again value key and calling set so when
we log key value and then my set is in
fact the calling set so let me clear the
console and run this and there you go
one one true to do true three three true
so in sets the key and value are both
the same but we have those three
parameters here because they wanted to
maintain the standard across arrays maps
and sets now if you have a look array
has three parameters map has three
parameters and they wanted to continue
the same and that is why they have three
parameters even for a set so the key and
value are going to be the same you can
just log out either one of them and when
we do a my set triple equal to the
calling set we have true so that was a
quick video about using the for each
loop on arrays with es5 or maps and sets
with es2015
so thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to subscribe I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
