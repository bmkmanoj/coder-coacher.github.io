created a template driven form and also
perform some basic validation now one
problem we currently have is that the
user has the Liberty to submit the form
even with invalid values so let me show
you what I mean now let me enter an
invalid name ABC and let's enter an
email so Robert email com street is
Baker Street city is London and then a
postal code which is again invalid so
let's go with a three-digit number
instead of a five digit number now there
is a small problem though when I try to
click on submit button the HTML is going
to validate the form inputs for us so
it's going to say please lengthen it to
4 characters now we don't want our
browser or the HTML to validate the form
for us we want to do it or we want to be
in charge of the validation so we're
here in the form tag add the attribute
no validate so this is going to prevent
the html5 validation so now when i
refresh i'm going to add a 3 character
name let's go with a Rob at email calm
then Street as make us read city is
London and then again a three-digit
postal code so now when I click on
submit if you have a look over here I
get the form values so object name is
ABC email is Rob at email comm and the
address we have city London postal code
123 and the street is Baker Street so we
are still able to post data to the
server which is invalid of course you
don't want this scenario so what we can
do is for this button tag we are going
to add a disabled property so the button
is going to be disabled and when is it
going to be disabled we are going to
retrieve the form dot valid property
from this user form so this user form
I'm going to copy this so not of user
form dot form dot valid so basically we
are saying that if the user form is
valid we are going to not apply this
disabled attribute but if the form is
invalid
we'll make we're going to make this
button disabled
so when I save this and head over to the
browser so there you go if you have a
look the submit button is disabled let
me enter a valid value so query T and
there you go submit is now valid and if
I enter an email or let's let's change
this postal code to a three-digit number
and there you go it's going to pop the
error message and submit is going to be
disabled so I cannot click on summit but
when I make it a five digit number I'm
able to submit this and if you head over
to the console you can have a look at
the object so we have address object
email is blank name is whatever we have
entered and the postal code is one two
three four five so that is how you
submit only a valid form now that pretty
much wraps up template driven forms so
thank you guys for watching and we'll
have a look at model driven forms in the
next video so don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
