selectors now there are two more
selectors that I want to cover in this
video and the first one is the
descendant selector so when you want to
apply a particular style to an element
only when it lies inside a particular
element then we make use of the
descendant selector so consider this
example we have a div tag and within the
div tag we have a paragraph tag and
let's say this is inside do now let's
also create a paragraph outside the dev
so this is outside do now what the
descendant selector allows you to do is
apply a style to an element only when it
lies inside another element so let's
have this paragraph tag which lies
inside the div tag have some style so to
specify a dissonant selector first we
specify the outer tag or this is going
to wrap the no.1 and then we are going
to have the paragraph tag which lies
inside the div tag and we can have a
color and let's say red so we are
indicating that the red color style
should be applied to the paragraph tag
only when it lies inside the div tag so
when you save it and refresh it so the
paragraph which is like which lies
inside the div tag now has a style
whereas the paragraph that lies outside
the dev does not have a style and that's
how a descendant selector works and the
second one is a child selector now this
is very similar to a descendant selector
but the second tag or this paragraph has
to be a child of the div tag well let me
give you an example let's change this to
body and to specify a child selector we
use the greater than sign and then the
second selector or the second element
and what this does is select the
paragraph tags which is which are the
children of the body tag so if you
consider our example here this paragraph
tag right here is a child of the div tag
but not an immediate child of the body
tag whereas the second one which is
outside the div tag is a child of the
body tag so when you let's just quickly
change red to blue when you save it and
refresh it you see that the one which is
inside the div tag which is not a child
of the body is going to be having a
default style whereas the one which is
outside the div tag so this paragraph
right here is a child of the body tag
and hence a color blue is going to be
applied so that's sums up the different
ways in which we can apply or in which
we can select the element so that we can
apply style to them and using these
selectors you can work wonders but
anyway thank you guys for watching don't
worry subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
