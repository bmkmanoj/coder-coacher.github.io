submit a form let us make some tiny
tweaks in our current code the first one
has remove this unnecessary break tag
the second one is replace author with by
and an NG model replace author with by
replace the type with email and add a
break tag and in our Abkhaz file change
channel ring to Chandler Chandler dot
Bank at gmail.com and Joey - Joey and
email com now the tricks are only to
help us with our next video so don't
worry all right now let's see how to
submit our form the first thing we want
to do is include a submit button so
input type is equal to submit and value
is equal to let's say add review now if
you go ahead and save it reload this we
have an add review button now in angular
we make use of a directive called ng
submit to submit a form let's go ahead
and add ng submit to our form tag so ng
submit now what ng submit does is it it
tells angular what has to be done when
the submit button is clicked so in our
case let us call a function called add
review which is going to add our form
review to our list of reviews now if you
notice we have our form object form
comment and form dot bye
but we never really initialized it
anywhere now that's a good programming
practice let us go ahead and type dollar
scope
dot form and initialize it to an empty
object now let's define our ad review
function so dollar scope dot ad review
is equal to a function left in the
function we are going to add our form
object which is our comment and and the
email to our list of reviews so the
reviews array so dollar scope dot
reviews dot push then we're going to
specify dollar scope dot forum go ahead
and save this save the index dot HTML
file when we reload and type this is a
new review and the author is Ross at
email comm if you know this since the
field is of type email it doesn't show
up until add something is written in in
the in the box so when we go ahead and
click on add review we have a new review
with the list of existing reviews now if
you notice we have our comment and
author still as our previous review what
we just inserted and our preview still
contains the data now this sort of is
confusing as it seems like a duplicate
entry so what are you going to do is go
to our add review function and just
reinitialize it to a blank object so
dollar scope dot form it's equal to
blank save it when you reload it and
type this is yet another review and the
author is ross at gmail.com now notice
this time though
review is going to clear out our comment
and author fields last thing to notice
here as we are not actually storing our
reviews anywhere such as a database so
whenever we click on refresh the newly
added reviews are going to disappear so
that's how you submit the form in the
next video
let's see some form validations thank
you for watching and don't forget to hit
