positioning is fixed positioning so if
you ever want to have an element to stay
at one particular place irrespective of
you scrolling the page then we make use
of a positioning called fixed
positioning so the first thing we are
going to do is to understand fixed
positioning let's create a bunch of
paragraph tags so this is a paragraph
all right let me just copy this and
paste a bunch of it and then let me copy
the entire thing and let's start pasting
okay that should be good now let's
refresh ok it is scrollable now that's
good now let's create a style so let's
create another class called fix
positioning so fi XP OS and this time
for the position property we are going
to be using a value called fixed and
then we can use let's say top 0 pixels
and let's use right this time so right 0
pixels let's create an h1 tag h1 tag and
let's just have it as fixed ok save it
ok I don't think you can see the screen
though they save it save and refresh ok
I have the fixed let me just move it and
let's add the class now so h1 class is
equal to figs pause save it and refresh
it so we have fixed on the right hand
side now here's how fixed positioning
works even though you're scrolling our
page
the fixed positioned element is going to
say stay at that exact place even when
you're scrolling so maybe you would want
a navigation bar that stays on top all
the time in your view or something like
that but generally people don't make use
of fixed positioning but it's good to
know that such a thing exists so by
making use a fixed positioning or a
value of fixed to the position property
we can fix the position of any element
on our screen irrespective of you
scrolling or not it is going to stay at
that exact same place anyways that's
pretty much it about the different kinds
of positioning in CSS thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
