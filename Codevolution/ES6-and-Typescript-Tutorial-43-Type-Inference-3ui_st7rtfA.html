about type inference so if we have a
declaration for n1 is equal to 10 type
script in first that n1 is of type
number so now if we try n 1 is equal to
hi typescript is going to flag this as
an error so if I hover over it it says
type string it's not assignable to type
number and this is because when we
declared the variable type script
inferred that the data type of n1 is
going to be a number so it is going to
prevent us from assigning any other type
of value to n1 so type inference helps
us by identifying mistakes when we are
writing our code however it is not
always reliable consider this example
I'm going to just comment this out so
let's say we have VAR n 2 and this is
going to be equal to n1 plus 10 so what
we what so what we assume is that we
have created available and two that
accepts numeric value and if I hover
over it that is in fact true and to a
soft type number but try this scenario
I'm going to change 10 to let's let's
change this to hello
and now if I hover over n2 it does it
has inferred our type script has
inferred that n2 is of type string
because on the right hand side the plus
is going to concatenate the string with
this numeric value and the result is a
string which is going to get assigned to
n2 so now when to type has changed from
a number to a string so when I go to the
console and or charge locked lock this
on to the console and to and save this
and there you go 10 as number and 1 and
then hello the string so what I want to
point out here is that it is not or it's
always better to use type annotations
rather than using type inference to
declare variables
so that's pretty much it for this video
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
