be learning about arrays and tuples in
typescript now arrays worked the same
way in typescript as they do in
JavaScript only the declaration is going
to differ
because now we have types now there are
two ways to declare arrays the first one
we can have let string array 1 and this
we can specify the type string followed
by square brackets to indicate that this
is going to be an array and on the right
hand side we can have the initialization
so hello
well now the second type is by making
use of the generic syntax hello so
string array 2 and over here we specify
array and string within these angle
brackets and this again can be
initialized to two the same thing hello
and we can have world so these are the
two syntaxes
to declare arrays now we can even have
let any array and this can be of type
any and it can hold literally any value
so hello and then we can have 10 and we
can also have true so by making use of
this any type we can't literally store
any type of data within this array but
typescript provides tuples which are
special Airy's that let you specify the
type the array can contain so let's say
we want an area that can hold only
string and numeric values so for that we
can make use of tuples so let my tuple
and this is just an array but when we
specify the square brackets we can
specify the type that are valid or the
types that are valid with this
particular array so I want only strings
and number so these are the only two
types that should be valid within this
particular array so now on the right
hand side I need to specify the matching
values first
I can specify high than 10 so now we can
just log to the console my table my
table of zero and log to the console my
tuple of 1 and let's save this and head
over to the browser
it says hi and 10 and we can continue to
add values to this particular array so
my table of 2 and this can be equal to
let's say 100 and log to the console my
tuple of 2 and we are going to still get
that value so hundred so we can add
elements as long as they are of the same
type specified while declaring this
array so string and number so tuples can
be made use our tuples can be used to
declare arrays where you want a
particular type of data to be stored but
it need not be just a single type so you
can have all sorts of combinations for
example we have string and number array
we can have a string and boolean a
number and boolean and so on so that's
it about the syntax and declaration of
arrays and tables in typescript thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
