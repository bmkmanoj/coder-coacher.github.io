us have a look at how do you work with
nodejs and MongoDB then before we start
off I'm going to be making the following
few assumptions
the first one is you have no no Jess and
NPM installed the second one is you have
MongoDB installed the third one is you
have a basic working knowledge of no GS
and finally you are very familiar with
the crud operations and MongoDB now if
you have a check against all these
assumptions let's get started the first
thing we want to do is to install the no
GS MongoDB driver and the folder we are
working with so I have created a folder
called Mongo so let's go ahead and
install excuse me the MongoDB driver so
NPM install along with DB and this might
take a few seconds let's give it some
time
all right there are a few hours but
because of diversions so we have
installed an NGS sorry we have installed
the MongoDB driver the next thing is
let's go ahead and create our dot JS
file so let's go ahead and say let's go
back to your desktop Mongo let's create
our final name as MongoDB is all right
there the first thing we want to do in a
dot yes file as you're required the
MongoDB module so very well MongoDB is
equal to require well not oMG Mongo TV
the second thing that's right
we need to create among a client that
interface that that interacts with the
mongery server so long go on a client is
equal to MongoDB
odd one go client now the next thing is
we need to specify the URL where a
database is going to reside so variable
URL is a call to MongoDB and it is a
local host our system on code two seven
zero one seven and let us say we want to
name our database as fruits now once we
have created the URL let's go ahead and
use the connect method of Mongo client
to set up the connection so one go
Mongo client or to connect this accepts
two parameters the first one is a URL
this where we wanted to we wanted to
connect to the second one is a callback
function so function error TV so the
callback function takes two parameters
the first one is error and the second
one is a result of connecting all right
so let's go ahead and continue so once
we establish the connect whether we say
there was an error then let's have a
look at it so console dot log error if
there is no error let's say console dot
log connected to our URL
the once we are done let's just close
the connection to our database divvied
out close
finally a semicolon now let's save the
file go back to your node one thing to
notice that I'm already connected to the
Whanganui instance let's go ahead and
run MongoDB is so node MongoDB dolce s
it says connected to MongoDB localhost
fruits right so that's how we connect
your database you look no Cheers and and
the next video let us see how to insert
a document into MongoDB</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
