video let us improve the UI of the video
detail component right now we are
displaying the title URL and description
as just plain text so let's add
bootstrap styling let's also change all
the fields to input and add to editor by
me again let's go back to visual area
code and instead of just the
interpolation I'm going to paste the
code let me explain what each of these
lights are and we have a div tag and
within the dev tag we have a form tag
this form has three elements the first
element is for the title so a class or
form group is from bootstrap so you can
ignore that then we have the input
element so the input element type is
input class is form control again a
bootstrap styling and then the name is
very important
the name is title you are also making it
a mandatory field you are providing a
placeholder and then we use the ng model
for tour a data binding a video dot
title and similarly we have the second
element in the form which is for the URL
it's an input tag saying class the name
is URL it's also required we have a
placeholder and then we have to editor
binding and similarly the last element
is a text area because this is the
description we are going to limit it to
five rows we are going to give it a name
of te SE and then we use ng model to
achieve to a data binding
so now let's build this and check how
this appeal check how this up here in
the browser so let me go back to command
prompt and then the command ng build
alright let's go to the browser and test
this now I'm going to refresh it and if
I click on a title sorry a video then we
should have three input fields so this
is the first input field for title the
second one for URL and the third one for
description
and one thing you can observe is because
of Torah databinding
is we change the title in the detail
view the list view also gets updated so
watch over here as I change the title so
there you go I have changed the title in
the detailed view simultaneously the
view in this video list component also
gets updated all right now a nice trick
we can add for the title is to first
display it as a heading
and when the user clicks on it it
changes to an input tag and then the
value can be edited so let's see how to
achieve that so let me go back to videos
to be a code and over here in video
detail component to the div tag that
displays the input title I'm going to
add the ng-if directive so star and gif
and this we are going to say edit title
in simultaneously or up this also going
to add a header tag so right below the
div tag I'm going to add a hitch h3 tag
and this we are going to use India is
not of edit title and then we are also
going to say if there is a click on this
particular heading you are going to fire
an on title click method which is going
to toggle this edit title value so let
me go back to video detail component
type script file and over here we are
going to first add a new property so
private edit title this is going to be
of type boolean and this is going to be
initially false next we are going to
define the on title click method so this
is just going to set edit title to true
initially there going to be false and
then when we click on it it is going to
become true also once the title has been
edited and you navigate away from the
current video so
input should turn back into a heading so
we are going to listen to ng on changes
lifecycle hook as well so just below ng
on in it we are going to add ng on
changes this dot edit title is equal
defaults so let's build this again and
test it out alright let's go back to the
browser I'm going to refresh this now if
I click on title one you see that title
one is now a heading and not an input
tag now let's say if I want to edit this
title I can simply click over here and
then it becomes an input box I can make
any change then I can navigate to a
different video but this time when I
come back to this title you see that it
has changed back to the heading it's not
an input tag anymore so let me just
explain the flow of execution once again
regarding this initially this edit
titles is false so over here edit title
is false so you cannot edit the title so
the input tag will be hidden and the
heading tags will be displayed and when
you click on this heading we have on
type clicked methods that is triggered
and over here is what is on title click
it says edit titles is true that means
the input tags is now visible and then
the heading is now hidden so once you
make any changes and you click away or
when the navvy when you navigate away
from the current video the Edit title
property gets set to false again and
that is how it changes back to this
heading alright now that we have the
layout in place from the next video
let's get started with the angular
services to create read update and
delete videos using the API that we have
created earlier in the series so thank
you guys for watching don't forget
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
