project or an application now there are
a couple of ways to do that and all of
them are listed in the view GS website
now the first one of course is to
download the development or production
JavaScript file and then reference it in
your application using a script tag the
second way is to use a CDN now I find
this to be the simplest way which is why
we will be using the CDN for the initial
set of videos in the series the third
way is to use NPM for this approach you
need to download nodejs which will also
download NPM for you and then you can
run the command NPM install view which
is going to download the view package
now after that you can again reference
the minified beauteous file using a
script tag finally we can also use the
view CLI now we will be using this for
the later part of the series when we
need to learn about components dot view
files and so on but I don't want to go
in-depth on this right now now there are
tons of concepts to learn first and
become familiar with buges which is
exactly what we are going to do we will
have a separate video dedicated to view
CLI so don't worry about it too much
right now alright so as I mentioned
earlier we will be using the CDN to get
started now I'm going to copy the
recommended link control C and I will be
using visual studio code as my editor
for this particular series but feel free
to use the editor of your choice
now what I've done is created a folder
called getting started with an index dot
HTML file with some basic HTML elements
now to get started create a new script
tag at the bottom of the body tag so
script and a source for the script is
going to be the CDN and you're all set
like I said it's really simple to get
started with view J's and as always you
can find all the source code on my
github repo and the link is in the
description</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
