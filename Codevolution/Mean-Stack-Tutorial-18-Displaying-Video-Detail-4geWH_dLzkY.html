to display the detailed view of a single
video and here's how it's going to work
right now we just have an alley of
videos in the video center component we
send this as an input to the video list
component and then it is being displaced
inside the video list component but now
when we click on a video
let's send and event an output from
video lift to with your Center and that
event contains information about the
clicked video so we will capture this
video in video center component and send
it as an input again but this time
choose the video detail component where
they will display the list or Teresa
details using angular and HTML now why
are we doing this because this is good
programming practice so stick in the end
of this video and this will make much
more sense
alright for the first step we are going
to send an event from the video lift to
the video center and capture the
selected video center component so I'm
going to go back to video studio code
and over here in videos list dot HTML or
video list component HTML we are going
to bind the click event on this
particular list item so click now what
happens when it is clicked you're going
to say fire the handler on select and a
sent the video so when this particular
list item is clicked we are going to
fire the on select method passing in the
current video next in video list
component type script file we are going
to do a couple of things the first one
is import component on in it and also
the event emitted class and then we are
also going to specify that this
particular company
have an output so after input for the
comma and then output this is going to
have an event let's name this select
video so this is the event that is going
to get fired
now over here inside the class we are
going to first get an instance of the
event a middle class so public
select video the public select video
this is going to be equal to a new event
emitter class and then we are going to
define the handler on select so this
right here has to be defined so over
here I'm going to say on select this is
going to have a parameter let's call
this width of type video then again I
need to import this so let me hold over
this and then import video then within
the pair of curly braces we are going to
say this dot select video dot emit and
what are we committing the video that
was just clicked so right now when the
user clicks on a particular video we are
sending out an email with that with the
information about that particular video
now let's go back to video Center
components and capture this event so in
video Center dot components dot HTML and
video list selector we are going to say
there is an image select video that will
be raised by video list so when this
event is raised we are going to call a
method on select video and we are going
to pass the event
so now that we are capturing this select
video event let's go to video center.com
punch PS and then access that particular
video so again we are going to have a
property this is going to be called
selected video this is of type video and
then we are going to define the method
so on select video is going to take in a
video of type Emmy and then this dot
selected video is equal to the video
that was just passed and then we will
also just log this to the console so
right now we have achieved two things
the first one is from video list
component we are sending an event select
video so this is going to contain
information about the clicked video then
back in video center component we are
capturing that select video event and
then assigning it to a property called
selected video so the video which was
clicked by the user is currently
available in video center component so
the last step is to send this back of
input to video details come to this
component where we are going to display
all the different details so now to pass
it as an input to the video detail
component but here in video Center
component HTML we are going to use
property data binding again so this time
we are going to pass in a single video
now what is the video that is going to
be passed
there's nothing but the selected video
but what happens when a user has not yet
selected a video so we should handle
that case as well so for that we are
going to use the in she is structural
directive and then we are going to say
if there is a selected video only then
displays the video detail component so
now that we are passing the selected
video as an input to video details let's
go to video details and display the
details so in the video details in the
type script files first we are going to
specify that there is an input so
put there's a video and then in the HTML
so let's go back over here in video
detail content HTML display the video
title the video URL and the video
description alright now our application
is ready to attempt the first let's do
this and then refresh the browser let's
go back to command prompt ng bill so now
let's go back to the browser and refresh
this so now if you see the video details
component is not displaying anything at
the moment but when I clicked on the
particular video which is at the title
which is title 1 the URL which is URL 1
and then the description which is the
ESC 1 is being displayed when I click on
title to the corresponding details are
displayed
and similarly title 3 and then title 4
so let me explain the flow one more time
so that you get a better understanding
of how all this works so let's let's
start from scratch let's go back to
video center component dot HTML sorry
let's go back to with your list
component dot HTML so over here when we
click on a particular video we call the
on select method passing in that
particular video so in video centre in
video list your component es over here
we have the on select method so when
this particular message is called it
fires an event which is called select
video and then it passes the video that
was clicked now in video center
component HTML we captured the select
video event and call the handlers on
select videos passing in dollar event
now this dollar event is going to give
us access to the video that was passed
now this select video let's go back to
video Center component dot here alright
this is the definition so when we get a
video from the event
we capture it and assign it to a
selected video property so now that we
have the video that was clicked in media
centers we pass it as an input so we
pass it as an input to the video detail
component and also we need to make sure
that the video detail is displayed only
when there is a selected video so the
use ng is to display the details details
only when there is a selected video so
all right now we are passing in the
video as an input to video detail and we
are accessing the video titles the URL
and the description so that is how the
these values are being displayed all
right I know that was a bit complicated
but you get the hang of it once you
start writing your own code now in the
next video let's format this detail
component and try to make use of two-way
data-binding
to make all the fields editable so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
