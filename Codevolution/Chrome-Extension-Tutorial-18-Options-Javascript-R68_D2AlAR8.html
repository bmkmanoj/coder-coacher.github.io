functionality of pop-up dodges then this
is going to be fairly simple all we are
going to do is when the user enters a
limit and clicks on the same limit
button then we are going to set a value
in the chrome storage and we are going
to retrieve that value at a later point
of time and when the user clicks on
reset total then we are going to assign
a value of zero to the already existing
variable total in the chrome storage so
let's see how to do that now I have
created a new file called option CAS
where we are going to implement our
options functionality so we're going to
start off with jQuery of course so
dollar and we're going to have a
function and inside the function we
first need to listen to the click event
of the save limit button so first let us
select the button so pound save limit
dot click to listen to the click event
and when the user clicks we need to do
something we first retrieve the value of
the input box so our limit is equal to
dollar the idea of the input box which
is nothing but limit dot Val so we are
storing the value in a variable called
limit so if there is a limit after all
then we're going to set that value in
chrome storage so chrome dot storage dot
sync dot set now this takes in an object
the property or the key is going to be
limit and the value is going to be the
limit this limit over here the variable
and then we can also specify an optional
callback function so function and we're
just going to close the tab so when the
user clicks on the button we're going to
set the value of limit and chrome
storage and close the current tab all
right now the other thing we need to do
is when the user clicks on reset total
so dollar
let's first select the button so reset
total then when the user clicks on that
we need to do something so what are we
doing we are going to set a value of 0
to total so chrome dot storage dot sync
dot set the total variable with the
value of zero so now let's go ahead and
save this and go back to our browser I'm
going to click OK let me close this and
reopen the options tab so options and
when I click on limit and let's say 10
save limit it's going to save the limit
and Chrome extension storage and then
close the tab but here's the thing when
I open the pop-up we don't see the limit
I did save a value but we don't see it
now we have just set the value for limit
we are not getting it anywhere and since
we have specified the display in the
pop-up we need to have that
functionality in pop up yes so let's go
back to pop-up yes and initially when we
are getting the total we also need to
get the limit so square brackets because
it's an error now and this is going to
be comma limit and we are going to close
this and over here we're going to say
dollar limit which is nothing but the ID
we have in pop-up dot HTML so dot text
is going to be budget dot limit so
budget dot limit so now let's save this
let me okay let me okay so when I open
this now we see that limit so when I go
to options page again I don't have to
limit here so we need to go back to your
options page and initially we need to
get the value if it's already stored so
Chrome dot storage yep we have done this
before
Chrome not storage dot
get what are we getting we are getting
the limit and we are also going to have
a callback function that takes an object
budget and we're just going to set
dollar pound limit so this is the idea
of the limit and the options page so dot
well is going to be budget dot limit so
now let's save this and let me close
this and open the options tab again and
there you go we have the limit displayed
so when I say hundred and save limit
it's going to close we're going to have
a limit of hundred over here and when I
click on options we have the limit
hundred here and now when I click OK we
have the total which is thousand hundred
I'm gonna click on reset total when I
open this the total spend is zero so
both our save limit and reset total
buttons are working perfectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
