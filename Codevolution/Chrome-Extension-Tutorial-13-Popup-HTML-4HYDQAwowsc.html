the UI for the pop-up so let's create a
new file and name it pop-up dot HTML and
here
we need to write the HTML code that is
going to represent our requirement so
we're going to start off with the
doctype and there's going to be HTML and
then we're going to have the HTML tag a
head tag within the head tag a title tag
that says Budget Manager and outside the
head tag we're going to have the body
tag and we'll have an h1 that says
Budget Manager then we are going to have
an h2 tag that says total spent and then
within the H do a span tag but an ID is
equal to total and this is initially
going to be 0 we're also going to have
another h2 tag for the limit and a span
tag again with an ID ID is equal to
limit now we're going to have an h3 tag
that just contains a label saying enter
amount and for this we are going to need
an input to accept the amount so input
type is equal to text we don't need a
name we do need a ID however so this ID
is going to be amount and we don't need
a value either alright now the last
thing we need is a button that is going
to submit the amount entered so input
type is equal to submit we don't need a
name but we do need an ID again so ID is
equal to let's call this spend amount
and then the value is going to be spent
all right now let's load this into the
browser and see if it works
also I have created three new icons for
this budget manager extension so let's
head over to Chrome
load unpacked extension and Budget
Manager ok so we have our budget manager
extension showing up and this is the
icon
that I have used in this particular
extension so when I click on this in the
toolbar
it says Budget Manager which is the h1
tag that and then total spend is zero
the limit is blank as of now we also
have the label enter amount and we can
enter any value and click on the spend
button of course the spend doesn't do
anything right now so we will add some
interactivity in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
