let us learn how to limit skip and saw
documents in a collection now what I've
done is copy the code from fine dot PHP
to a new file called sort PHP so we have
our client we have our company database
we have our employee collection we use
the fine method on the employee
collection without specifying any search
condition so as to select all the
documents and then we use the for each
loop to iterate through each document
and then displayed on screen so now the
first thing we can learn is how to limit
the number of retrieved documents so for
that first I'm going to specify empty
bracket so as to not specify any
condition while retrieving and now I can
specify another set of bracket or array
okay we can have limit now this limit
keyword is going to be used to limit the
number of documents retrieved so let's
say we want just two documents retrieved
so let's save this if you have a look at
our fine dot PHP we have eaten first
and eat and second so I would like to
find out that I had incorrectly inserted
to Ethan's initially so we have to
Eton's one with 81 as the ID and other
with 82 so eat and eaten and then Andrew
Brad Chris and then what was supposed to
be W so we have a total of six documents
and we are going to limit it to two
documents so let's go over here and sort
dot PHP and control you and there you go
we have the first document eaten and the
second Ethan 81 and 82 so that's how
limit works it's going to limit the
number of documents now we can also skip
through a few documents that have been
retrieved using the Skip keyword so skip
and let's say we want to skip through
two documents so let's save this and see
what happens so I'm going to refresh it
do a ctrl you and there you go
have Andrew and Brad so the first two
documents eaten and eaten have been
skipped because we have said we or we
have mentioned skip through the
first-year documents but with the
remaining documents are going to be
limiting it to only two so you just have
Andrew and Brad Chris and Debbie are not
visible anymore and now finally we can
also sort the retrieved documents so
let's say start and this is going to be
again what do you want to sort on let's
say we want to start based on the age so
when you assign one to a particular feed
it says sort in ascending order and when
you say minus one it is going to be sort
in the descending order now let me also
change lemma two for that so that we can
have a good number of documents to
verify so let's refresh this and you are
control you and there you go so we have
blue or Debbie which eight with age 28
as the first document Chris with 27 Brad
with 26 and end over 25 so that's pretty
much it I'm a loretta skip and sword
feel free to use it play around with
that so thank you guys for watching and
don't forget subscribe I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
