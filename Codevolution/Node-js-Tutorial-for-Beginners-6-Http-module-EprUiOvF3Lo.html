video we saw how we can create our own
modules but a great thing about nodejs
is that it comes shipped with a set of
built-in modules called core modules so
that we don't have to code everything
from scratch now one such module is the
HTTP module that allows us to use the
HTTP server and client and in this video
let us see how we can use the head City
HTTP module to create our very first web
server that responds with hello world
when a request is made from the browser
so we have AB dot J's and as we saw in
the previous video we are going to use a
required keyword to import the module so
it's a good convention to use the name
of the variable the same as the name of
the module so we have a variable HTTP is
equal to require and with a single codes
HTTP now since it's a code module we
don't have to specify the dot and the
slash which specifies the directory so
we can have variable HTTP is equal to
require HTTP and this loads up they
still be module then in the next line we
are going to use the create server
method or function and the an HTTP
module and this is going to return an
object which in turn has a method call
to listen and this takes a parameter
which is a port number so let's say a
t-888
is going to be our port number and
that's it we have created a very first
HTTP server but this is absolutely
nothing right
so in a create server we are going to
pass an anonymous function so recollect
that a function that does not have a
name and can be defined as a parameter
itself is an anonymous function
so now let's have two parameters for our
anonymous function the first one is a
request and the second one requests and
second one is a response now what we can
deal with this anonymous function the
first one is response dot right head and
we're going to pass 200 as the status
which is okay and then we're going to
pass them pass an object which specifies
the content type so content type would
be text slash plain and then we're going
to respond so response dot right with
hello world
well I don't know how I end up typing
the W so response then we are going to
end this response so response dot end
and when we go ahead and save it and go
to your window tweak the command prompt
and type node AB dot Chasse
and if you go to our browser and type is
adv localhost and since we have
specified a TD days eat as our port
number then we go to this particular URL
then we see hello world and there you go
we have created a reference server and
responded with hello world so just to
explain it again we have required a CD
with core module and the HTTP code
module has a create server function and
this takes a callback function and in
our callback function we have passed a
request and response as parameters
and right now we are not doing anything
with the request object but using a
response object we are going to display
hello world and in the browser and don't
worry about the dot right
i sorry the dot and these are events
which we are going to be seeing in the
further videos I just wanted to show you
how to create a server but why exactly
are we writing this code to create the
server I'm going to be talking about
when we are creating our own node.js
application so that's pretty much it
about the HTTP module thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
