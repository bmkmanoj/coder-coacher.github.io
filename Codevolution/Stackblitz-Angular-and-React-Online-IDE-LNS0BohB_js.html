video I want to introduce you all to
stack blitz so I will go over what is
tablets
why you might want to use this and also
some of the really cool features that
are available with it all right so what
is stagnates tablets is an online Visual
Studio code IDE where you can create
angular react and ionic projects that
are immediately online and shareable
using a link now why would you want to
use it for me personally and I'm sure
you all can relate to it as well when
starting out with a new technology a
challenge is understanding the initial
setup what are the different files what
are the necessary packages what needs to
be bundled what needs to be built and
what needs to be deployed we might think
of just using code from someone's github
repo but once we download or fork it and
try to use it even that might not work
now if you consider angular for example
even the simplest of apps requires so
many files folders and packages so I
would say to ease this burden on angular
and react developers stackless has been
created so if you're struggling to get
your angular or react basic project up
and running I would highly recommend
using Stagg blitz to get started let me
explain some of the awesome features
that it has
and then you'll definitely consider
using it now I'm going to click on the
angular link over here and if you see it
is going to open a new browser tab and
over here we have a very basic angular
application already up and running now
we can divide this into three main parts
on the Left we have the file explorer in
the center we have the editor and on the
right we have a live preview of our
application now the first thing I want
to mention is that it is basically like
Visual Studio code in the browser
so if you press ctrl P you can search on
the different files in your project and
select them
so navigating between the files is easy
and if I start to type something for
example a variable declaration my work
you can see that there is intelligence
as well and if you make a mistake you're
going to get a red squiggly where the
mistake is
and if you make a mistake that is going
to break the application for example
this statement over here then you are
going to get a highlight on that
particular line level as well as the
file level so this is pretty cool as
well the second thing about Stagg list
is the ease with which you can add or
remove an NPM package so if you notice
we don't have the package JSON file
instead we have the list of dependencies
over here now in this input box you can
type in a package name for example
lodash and press Enter this is going to
install the package and add it to our
project and then you can start using
lodash you can also very easily delete
the package from your project it is
going to bundle again and reload only
with the specified packages you can also
specify the package version so if I want
to install lodash at 4.1 I can say load
at at 4.1 and that particular version
gets installed so this is really helpful
you don't have to use the terminal
anymore the third thing about tag list
is the live preview so if you go to AB
dot component out here if I change
angular 4 to let's say Stagg list it
updates right away in the live preview
you can choose to have the live preview
or close it if you wish to using this
particular button on the top right
so close it open it you can also open
this in a new window so I'm going to
close this and I can click on open a new
window and it is going to open the exact
same application live preview in a
different tab
another amazing feature that stagnates
provides is editing even when offline so
let me disconnect my connectivity and
when I try to load my github page you
can see that there is no internet
connectivity however if I change stag
let's - let's say offline you can see
that the live preview still works we get
hello offline and if I change string to
let's say boolean you can also see that
intellisense works as well so you can
edit your code even when you don't have
internet connection all right let me
quickly connect back to my Wi-Fi there
you go finally a word or two about
sharing your code so make sure you're
logged into github and once you're
logged in you can name your project so
I'm going to click on this edit icon and
change this to my test demo so you can
see that the URL updated my project name
updated and also my github username is
now provided right underneath this
project name so now I can click on share
and then I can share either the code so
editor URL or just the app for preview
so the app URL so let me copy and paste
this so you get access to that same
particular project and if I copy just
the app URL paste it in the URL bar you
can see that only the application can be
seen and not the code so it is really
easy to share your applications or the
code online using stacked lids you can
even click on export which is going to
generate a zipped file of your project
and you can share that as well
or you can even click on Fork which is
going to fork this particular project
and then you can go ahead change it to
whatever you want so my test demo fork
and then this is going to create that
particular project for you well that's
pretty much what I wanted to explain
about tablets I hope this is going to be
useful for all those who are working on
angular or react or ionic I definitely
think it will so head over to stagnate
and get started with your new project
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and let me know in the
comments what you guys think about stack
lids</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
