yet another concept of angular
animations namely automatic property
calculation now when you want to animate
certain properties like height or width
of an element it gets a bit tricky
because elements tend to have height and
width that depend on their content and
also the screen size so to solve this
problem angular provides a special
property value that is denoted by the
star symbol and when you specify this
star value then the value of that
particular property gets computed at
runtime and the value is also then
plugged into the animation so let's have
a look at an example now for this
example I have created a new class class
height box it has a width but it does
not have any particular height so now in
our template let's create another div
element that we are going to animate so
div and let's add a class class is equal
to height box and over here I'm going to
specify five break tags so that we have
some sort of height to this div element
so break and I'm just going to copy this
let me see here pretty lazy so alright
let's go with six break tags now we have
the element that to be animated so let's
add a trigger over here let's call this
height trigger so height trigger and
then we are going to assign a state for
binding so height state now let's go
ahead and define that animation now I'm
going to copy/paste this particular
animation because there are a lot of
parentheses and curly braces involved
and I don't want to mess up on the
syntax of it so I'm going to copy hi
trigger come back here paste it and then
instead of off and on you're going to
toggle between no height and full height
so these are the two states for this
particular animation now instead of
background color we are going to specify
the height
D when there is no height the height is
zero when the state is full height we
are going to ask angular to dynamically
calculate the value so for that we
specify star now instead of double
transition I'm going to merge it into a
single line so instead of off so no
height and then a double sided arrow and
then full height and we are going to
remove these excessive styles and
transitions from our additional sides
from this transition so we are just
going to animate for a duration of two
seconds so no height to full height so
now let's go ahead and add a button to
toggle between the two states so I'm
going to copy paste this line so instead
of toggle lights I'm going to say toggle
height and instead of toggle lights
again I'm going to say toggle height and
over here in our class just like room
state I'm going to have another property
height state string and then initially
we want this to appear on the screen so
full height and then we are also going
to toggle light and copy-paste this
because toggle Heights is something
similar so toggle height and then
instead of room state we're going to
have height state height state height
state instead of off we're going to have
no height and stuff on full height and
instead of off again no height all right
so let's go ahead and test our animation
so we have our two div elements the
first one is for table.you lights the
second one the smaller div element that
you see is for toggle height now
initially it's in the full height state
so if I click on this toggle button it
is going to make a transition to no
height where is that okay here so height
is going to become zero so let's
click this so the height becomes zero
now if I click on the toggle button
again it's going to achieve the state of
little height where the height gets
dynamically computed so I'm going to
click on this there you go
it takes up the height of those six
brake tags so we haven't specified the
height explicitly angular is going to
compute that dynamically now another
point that I want to highlight here is
that a single HTML element can have
multiple triggers for example I can copy
this lights on/off trigger and I can add
it to this just created div element so
now both these buttons are going to
animate the second div element so I'm
going to click on toggle lights there's
a delay of 3 seconds to 3 and then both
of them are going to rotate so it is
possible to have as many triggers as you
want on a particular element and
different buttons that trigger different
animations on that particular HTML
element all right so that's what that is
what I wanted to show you about
automatic probability calculation thank
you guys for watching don't really
