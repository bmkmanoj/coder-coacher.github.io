learn the basics of a component we are
going to understand what exactly makes
up a component and how we can add a new
component to our angular application a
component is made up of three parts the
first one is a template which represents
the view this is created using HTML it
will be the user interface for your
application
next we have a class which is nothing
but code that supports the view and this
is created using typescript the class
like any other programming language
contains data properties and methods
that can be used to control the logic of
the view for example we can have a
method to show or hide an element based
on the value of a property
finally a component also has some
metadata attached to it and this is the
information that angular needs to decide
if the particular class is in fact an
angular component or just a regular
class the metadata is defined using a
decorator which is a feature in
typescript a decorator is just a
function that provides information about
the class attached to it and for
component we use the component decorator
so if we put together a template a class
and some metadata we get an angular
component now let's try to relate this
to the app component that we have in our
hello world angular application so let
me go back to visual studio code and
open the file AB component dot tears at
the bottom we have our class in the name
of the class is AB component this class
currently contains one property which is
the title and does not contain any
methods keeping it simple to this class
we have the metadata attached in the
form of a decorator and to be more
specific the component decorator
and the component decorator is basically
a function that attaches to the class
right below it and in our case it is
attached to the app component class and
it is this decorator that tells angular
hey this is not a plane class this is a
component the component decorator
contains both the metadata and the
template which represents the view so as
part of the metadata we have a selector
a template URL and styles the selector
is basically a custom HTML tag that can
be used to represent this component when
you specify a selector in your HTML
angular renders the components template
in its place so for our hello world
example you can see the selector for app
component is app root and in our index
dot HTML file it is used as a custom
HTML tag so absolute in the opening and
closing tag so angular renders the add
components template when it comes across
this a bruit selector but what exactly
is the template for this component that
is defined using the template URL the
template URL points to an HTML file that
represents the view for this component
and if we take a look at AB dot
component dot HTML in our template we
have welcome - followed by the title in
double curly braces and the title is
nothing but the property in our class
which is code evolution so when we run
the application this HTML which is in AB
dot component dot HTML gets replaced in
the index dot HTML file where you
specify this component selector so that
is how the HTML template gets rendered
in the browser and finally we can have
styles that apply only to this component
and that is specified using the style
URLs property which points to CSS files
right now this file is empty
but you can study your component using
this file so that is basically the
structure of a component and how you
include it in your application but let's
try to improve our understanding of
components let's create a new component
and add it to your application and also
make some modifications now to create a
new component we will again use angular
CLI so in the integrator terminal wait
at the bottom of a screen we are going
to run the command in G G for generate C
for component followed by name of the
component let's call this test now when
this command completes execution a
couple of things happen and you can see
them in the integrated terminal itself
first you can see that four new files
were created and also there was an
update to the app module so let's take a
look and see what happens in the folder
itself so in the app folder a new folder
called test is created specifically for
this component within this folder the
type grid file the HTML and the CSS are
created a spec file for testing is also
created but we don't really need this
so mmm deleted and you can notice even
though we named our component as just
test dot component is automatically
added this is the convention to naming
components in angular and angular CLI
follows that and if we take a look at
the HTML file test works as typed out
for us and test is basically the name of
the component so we have now created a
new component but anytime you create a
new component your application should be
aware of it
so in the app module file we import the
test component and then add it to our
declarations array this array which is
the declarations array contains all the
components used by the application now
if you notice the test component is
already imported
and added to the declarations alley
courtesy of our friend angular CLI so
with just a single command you can
generate a new component that is ready
to be used in your angular application
now to include this component in your
HTML we just add a custom HTML tag that
represents the selector and if you go
back to test component es you can see
that the selector for the test component
is app - tests so let's go back to AB
dot component HTML which represents the
view for app component which is the
route component of our application and
over here I'm going to remove the
unordered list remove the h2 tag remove
the image and over here I'm going to
include the custom HTML tag app - test
and remember our angular application
will have one root component which is
the app component and all the other
components will fall under this app
component and that is why we include app
test inside app component HTML so if we
save this now go back to the integrated
terminal and at the bottom of your
screen type the command NPM start or ng
serve it is going to start your
application and if we head to the
browser and click on the refresh button
you can see welcome to code evolution
displayed which is the template for the
app component and also test works which
is the template for the newly added test
component so we have successfully added
a new component to our angular
application now let's see what are some
of the changes that you can make to any
component so let's head over to test
component es and over here let's begin
with the selector there are in fact
three ways to specify the selector the
first one is what we have seen already
we specified the selector app - test and
use it as a custom HTML tag the second
way is to use it as a class so begin
your selector with a dot character and
you can use this selector as a class
name
so instead of app - test as a custom
HTML tag we can have a div tag and -
this div tag we can have a class is
equal to app - test now if you save this
and head over to the browser you can see
that our application still works fine
test words is displayed in the browser
and finally the third way to specify is
to enclose a selector within square
brackets so square brackets around app -
test and then in our HTML we need to use
app - test as an attribute so instead of
the class attribute we specify app -
test as the attribute to this div tag so
now when you save this and the browser
refreshes you can see that the
application still works fine test works
is still displayed on the browser so
there are three ways to specify the
selector for your component the next
thing we can change is the template now
if you notice we have the template URL
property which points to the file that
contains the HTML test dot component dot
HTML but in any component it is also
possible to specify the template inline
meaning in the same typescript file and
for that we use the template property so
you can change template URL to just
template and now we can specify the HTML
right here so within single codes I can
have a div tag that says inline template
and if we save this and head over to the
browser you can see that the browser now
displays inline template but sometimes
your inline HTML might span a couple of
lines and for that we make use of back
tags and this is the key just below the
Escape key and above the tab key so
replace the single codes with backticks
and now I can write multiple lines of
HTML and it still works so if you save
this and head over to the browser you
can see that the template is still
working fine inline template
is being displayed now possibly for the
first half of this series I will be
making use of inline templates meaning I
will be writing HTML in the typescript
file itself now there are two reasons
the first reason is you can see both the
class and the template at the same time
which will help you to understand
concepts about data binding easily
second I don't have to jump between the
HTML and the typescript files every time
I have to make a change so we will be
learning more about templates in the
upcoming videos now the next thing we
can change is the style URLs property
which points to the CSS files but just
like the HTML you can have the CSS
inline as well so instead of style URLs
property we can just have the Styles
property and this will be an array and
again we can make use of backticks to
specify multiple lines of CSS so we're
gonna have backticks split it into
multiple lines and add a style to the
div element so div color is going to be
let's say red now if we save this and
head over to the browser you can see
that the inline template is now being
displayed in red color so just to
quickly summarize what we have learned
so far components are building blocks of
angular applications a component
contains a class a decorator and the
template which represents the view any
new component has to be imported and
added to the module in the declarations
array you can then include the selector
in your HTML either as a custom tag or
as a class or as an attribute the HTML
and CSS can either be in a separate file
or they can also be in line in the
typescript file we can make use of
backticks to specify multiple lines of
HTML and CSS the component class
contains data that can be displayed in
the view and finally it is possible to
nest components within other components
and also reuse them when required
alright that's pretty much the basics of
a component in angular
