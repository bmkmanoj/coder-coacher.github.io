to be a quick video on default export
now whenever we have modules that export
only a single value or a function then
we can make use of the default keyword
while exporting so consider consider
this example in our module bjs i'm going
to have a new variable let f name is
equal to chandler and now since this is
going to be the only export from this
particular file or module we can use
export default and then without curly
braces the name of the variable so
export default f name now also while
importing it there are few changes the
first thing is you can leave out the
curly braces so we don't have to use the
curly braces while importing default
export and the second thing is unlike
named export where the name of the
variable while exporting has to match
the name while importing in module or in
default export and import the name
doesn't have to match so over here I can
just call it first name from dot slash
module B dot J's now this is going to
work because we are going to be
exporting only a single value from
module B and that is going to be
captured in whatever we are importing so
first name is going to be mapped onto F
name so if we go ahead and lock to the
console first name and save this and
head over to the browser
we have Chandler so that's how defaults
works out the default exports work and
another thing to keep in mind as we can
also provide alias for importing default
but the only thing is we need to use
curly braces so default as let's call it
F so this default is going to be the
default import from module B and I'm
just going to Elias it with F so when I
save this and refresh Chandler
so ABS
that's work with default imports as well
now if you leave out curly braces you
must have default export otherwise it's
going to be an error so there was a
quick video about default export thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
