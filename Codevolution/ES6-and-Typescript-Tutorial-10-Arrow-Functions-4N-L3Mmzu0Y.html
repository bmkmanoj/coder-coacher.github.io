number ten and in this video we are
going to be learning about another
important syntax addition to es2015
which is the arrow function now arrow
functions provide a short and concise
syntax for writing functions and they
also simplified the behavior of the this
keyword in JavaScript so let's have a
look at the syntax of arrow functions in
this video and in the next video let us
have a look at the disk keyword okay so
I'm gonna start off by writing a simple
JavaScript function so mark get regular
function value and this is going to be a
function and all it's going to do is
return 10 so console dot log let's call
this function get regular value and
let's see what as output on the console
10 so our function is working fine so
now let's see how to convert this
function right here into an arrow
function now in es2015 remember we don't
we try to avoid war declaration as much
as possible so I'm gonna replace war
with Const and let's have get arrow
value now the first thing we can do with
arrow functions is omit the function
keyword so we can have just the
parentheses and this is followed by what
is known as fat arrow so the equal to
followed by the greater than sign is
called fat arrow and on the right hand
side we have the curly braces and then
return 10 now let's call console dot log
get arrow value and let's save this
let's have a look at console 10 and 10
now it's working fine but I did mention
that arrow functions are much more short
and concise right so here's the thing if
our function has just a single statement
within the body then we can remove this
curly braces and we can also remove this
return keyword and all right there you
go
these three lines of code right here is
made into this particular line of code
it's as simple as that
you have the fat arrow syntax on the
left hand side you have the parameter
list to the function on the right hand
side you have an implicit return value
so no parameters right now and we are
returning ten now let's say we want to
pass an argument so let's say M and I
want to say 10 star M so M is a
multiplier you are going to pass this
and return 10 times of M and over here
let me pass 5
so this is going to give us 5 into 10
which is 50 so let's save this 50 but
here's the thing when you pass a single
argument
you can even omit this parenthesis so
let me save this and the browser refresh
is 50 so that's another shorthand you
have or a shorter form you have you can
omit the parentheses when you have a
single parameter now people have to pass
multiple parameters you need you need
the parentheses so let's say M comma
bonus and let's pass 10 10 times of M
plus bonus and let's give a bonus value
of 50 so 5 times 10 plus 15 which needs
to be hundred refresh hundred so that's
how you work with error functions or
that's the syntax of it and in fact if
you have a look at console dot log type
type off get arrow well get our value
and save this and let's see what it
shows function so again everybody over
here is in fact a function and it's not
a new concept
or an alternative to a function it is
just a shorter way of writing a regular
JavaScript functions now if you have to
specify a function body with multiple
lines
make sure that you enclose them within a
pair of curly braces and you also have
the return keyword stated explicitly so
that's pretty much it for this video
thank you guys for watching and you're
pretty subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
