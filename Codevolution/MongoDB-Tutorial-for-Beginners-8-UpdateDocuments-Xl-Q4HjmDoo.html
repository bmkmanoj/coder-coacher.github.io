how to update values with a document now
first of all let us retrieve all the
documents so DB dot employees dot find
dot sorry dot pretty we have a list of a
documents now let's say we have we want
to update Andrew Neil salary to 90,000
let's see how to do that the first thing
is DV dot employees dot update now the
update command is used to update
documents now it takes two parameters
the first one is a selection criteria
now what document do we need to update
now remember this object ID that MongoDB
inserts into every document when it is
not specified it is used to uniquely
identify the document so let us copy
this and we are going to be pasting it
as a selection criteria the second thing
the second parameter is what the update
value should be so type dollar set and
we're going to say alright we need to
update the salary to 90,000 now we run
the query says update employees
collection find the document where the
object ID is this and set at a salary to
90,000 so when we go ahead and execute
that we get one modified record or one
modified document now if we say DV dot
employees thought find dot three and we
can see that and Anil salary has been
upped to 90,000 don't let us take a
second example let us say we want to
update the salary of all employees who
have a skill in MongoDB
so DB dot employees dot update and we
are going to be specifying the selection
criteria as skill is MongoDB and the
update value would be dollar set salary
will be changed sorry mr. Coates the
salary will be changed to 150,000 now we
have people with MongoDB
1 then we have Felicia who is against
scale in MongoDB finally George who is
also skilled in MongoDB
so let's see control shift enter
it says modified s1 now why is that by
default
MongoDB only updates a single document
the first one it finds and it doesn't
update other documents so to do suppose
we want to update all the documents to a
new salary we need to specify a third
parameter to update command and this
it's an optional one and let's called
multi so if we set multi to true it says
that all right ok before that let me
just go ahead and show you the updated
150 thousand salary so Andrew Neil
salary has been updated to 150,000 but
Felicia still has 85,000 and chart still
has 88,000 so when we specified the
multi option it says that all right
please update every single document that
matches this criteria so anyone who has
MongoDB skill set their salary now to do
that
200,000 so let's go ahead and execute
this so three three documents mats and
three documents that have been updated
now let us just do find and we see that
a new Neil's
salary has been updated to two hundred
thousand we have Felicia's two hundred
thousand and George two hundred thousand
so that's how you go about updating
documents the first one is the selection
criteria the second one is to update
data now if you want to update multiple
documents specify third parameter but
multi set to true and thank you for
watching I'll catch you in the next
