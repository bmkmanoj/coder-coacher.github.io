15 and in this video we are going to be
learning about iframes now iframes are
used to display a web page inside
another web page so currently we have
two web pages the first one as index dot
HTML and the second one is Chandler dot
HTML so let's see how we can embed China
dot HTML within the index dot HTML so
let's say we want him rated below
channel about Chandler so the tag we are
going to be making use of this iframe
the iframe tag is going to take an
attribute called source where we need to
specify the other web page so since we
are embedding Chandler dot HTML so we
are going to specify channel HTML as the
value to the source attribute now when
we save this and reload it we get a
small frame which is going to be
displaying Chandler dot HTML so you can
scroll till the very end and if you see
that we have the career so yep
we have Chandler dot HTML embedded into
our index dot HTML you can also specify
the height and the width so width is
equal to let's say 700 pixels and then
height is equal to let's say 500 pixels
you save it and reload it and we get a
bigger iframe and easier to read the
embedded web page now another use of the
iframe is to embed videos especially
those from YouTube so I have this
angular JS video from the German channel
open so if you ever want to open or
sorry embed a video just click on share
then click on embed and YouTube is going
to provide a link for you so when you
copy it and then let's say let's face it
at the very top so
let's face it over here and then when
you save it and go back and reload it we
have we have our YouTube video that is
going to be embedded onto your web page
and we can just play the YouTube video
right from our web page so that's pretty
much it about iframes and in the next
video
we are going to be starting to learn
about we are going to start learning
about forms in HTML so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
