clear up on one thing this series is not
a tutorial on the new features in
angular 5 learning about the changes
will hardly take your day my intention
with this series is to have it like a
crash course for a complete beginner so
a person new to angular itself and not
necessarily the latest version will find
it useful so this series will cover all
the main concepts in angular and not
just the changes from a particular
version I just want to give you guys a
heads up on what to expect because the
last thing I want is for someone who is
an angular expert to sit through these
videos all right then in this video
let's take a look at the prerequisites
for learning angular and also set up our
dev environment
now to get started with angular you need
to know the basics of HTML CSS and
JavaScript angular however makes use of
typescript so a very basic knowledge of
typescript makes a lot of difference you
can still follow the videos as
typescript is pretty simple to learn if
you know JavaScript but I would
recommend you go through the es2015 I'm
typescript series on my channel before
getting started with angular
alright now let's set up our dev
environment to start building angular
apps we need note and NPM and you'll see
a light and a text editor like Visual
Studio code so the first thing you need
to do is install node.js open your
browser and go to WWE org and install
the latest stable release when you
install node NPM which is the node
package manager also will be installed
once you have node.js installed open a
command prompt and type the commands
node - V and NPM - V both the commands
if node is successfully installed return
the respective versions so right now I
have node with a version of eight point
nine point one and NPM with a version of
five point five point one now that we
have NPM also installed our next step is
to install the angular CLI now for those
who are unaware of what angular CLI
is it is basically a command line
interface for angular it allows you to
generate building blocks of your angular
application by just typing out the
commands it makes your development
quicker and easier and all this while
following the best practices you don't
really have to worry if you don't know
angular CLI because all you need to know
is a couple of commands which I will
explain throughout the series
but if at all you're curious to learn
more about angular CLI I have a series
in the channel
and I'll have a link at the end of this
video all right so to install angular
CLI in your command prompt enter the
command npm install - g4 global at angle
slash CLI this will globally install
angular CLI now I already have angular
CLI installed so to check my current
version of angular CLI I can run the
command ng - V now if you don't get the
same display as me that is this angular
CLI world art make sure you add angular
CLI to the path environment variable now
that we have node NPM and angular CLI
installed the final step is to make sure
you have an editor of your choice for
this series I will be using Visual
Studio code but feel free to use any
editor that you are comfortable with
alright now that we have everything in
place let's create a hello world angular
application in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
