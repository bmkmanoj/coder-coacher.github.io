look at commands related to database now
in the Stewart in this tutorial let's
have a look at collections now to give
you an example of how collections are
suppose we have a database of
programmers then we could have
collections of Python programmers of
c-sharp programmers of C++ programmers
and so on now let's look at some of the
commands related to collections
the first one is creating a collection
so the command is DV dot gree create
collection and say we have a test
collection and if I hit control enter
says ok so the creation the collection
was created now how do we check what are
the collections in the database the
command is show collections so the show
collections come and show us the list of
collections and the current database so
a system that indexes something that's
provided before so the one we created
now as test collection and that is
present now there's a second way to
create a collection and that is by
directly inserting a document into the
database
now the command for that is DB dot new
collection dot insert we're going to say
name and we have tests so this so one
record was inserted into new collection
so this an alternative way of inserting
a document so what this does is if new
collection doesn't exist it is going to
create the collection and then it is
going to insert this document if the new
collection already exists that is just
going to go ahead and insert this
if I say show collections
let's first test new collection and
system dot indexes so that's how you
create collections and to drop a
collection or to delete a collection the
command is DV dot collection name so new
collection and dot drop so when you see
control enter but is true so the
collection was dropped now if we go
ahead and say show collections so the
new collection is not there anymore
we just have tests and system dot
indexes now that's how we created drop
collections thank you all thank you for
