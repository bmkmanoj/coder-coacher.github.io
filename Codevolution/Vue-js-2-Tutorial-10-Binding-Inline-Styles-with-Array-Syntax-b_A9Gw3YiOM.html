styles is using the array syntax now
that is in text is basically a helping
hand to the style object that we learned
in the last video so we saw how a style
object makes the template look more
clean now it might so happen that for a
particular element you may want to apply
multiple style objects that are already
created so to apply more than one style
object we make use of the array syntax
let's understand with an example let's
as you we already have two style objects
so I have created two styl objects the
first one is a base style object which
has a font size and a padding the second
one is a success style object which has
a color a background color and a border
so let's create a div tag and add both
these styles using the erasing tags so
over here I'm going to create a div tag
I'm going to call this success style now
to bind using the array syntax we again
use the V bind directive the attribute
is still going to be the style attribute
and this time we are going to assign an
array of values to the style attribute
the first one is going to be the base
style object the second one is going to
be the success style object let's save
this and refresh our browser and you can
see the new div tag and if you inspect
the element you can see that the styles
from both the style objects are being
applied so font size of 50 pixels
padding of 10 pixels this comes from
based I'll object and then we have a
color of green a background color of
light green and border of 1 pixel solid
green which comes from the success style
object color background color and a
border so we are able to apply multiple
style objects to a single HTML element
but a point to make note of with the
array syntax is that the styles written
in the last style object
the previous style objects so for
example if we add a padding of 20 pixels
so padding of 20 pixels in the success
style object it is going to override the
padding of 10 pixels in the base style
objects let's save this go back to our
browser and refresh it you can see that
the padding is now 20 pixels which is
from the success style object so the
last style object declared in the array
always gets priority when there are
conflicting styles within the site
objects in this case a panic of 10
pixels versus a padding of 20 pixels and
just to improve on this example we can
have another style object I'm going to
call this a dangerous tile object it is
going to have a color dark red
background color red and the border 1
pixel solid dark red and I can create a
new div tag let's just change success to
danger so dangerous style object and
change success style text to danger
style
so if we save this go back to the
browser and refresh it you can now see
the danger style object along with the
base style object that is applied to
this particular div tag and if you have
a look at the code it is kind of evident
we are able to reuse the code and this
is one of the things I love about UJS it
allows even inline styles to be reusable
and at the same time carry some semantic
meaning you're going to really
appreciate this if you work on some
legacy code where the inline styles are
just randomly thrown into the HTML and
you have no clue if it is safe to remove
them or not
alright so that is about binding inline
styles to your template the object
syntax and the array syntax thank you
guys for watching don't forget to

next video about class binding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
