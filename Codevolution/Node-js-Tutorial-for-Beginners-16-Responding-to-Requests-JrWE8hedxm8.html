to your requests now generally we would
think that the request Handler is going
to have some response data and then we
pass it on to the router module and then
we pass it on to the server module where
the server is finally going to respond
to the request well know instead we are
going to take this response object pass
it from our server to our router module
and then to your handler module so that
the handler can respond to the request
itself so in your server dulces file
include this new parameter so sorry
include in the route function this new
parameter which is going to be the
response object and we are going to be
removing these three lines of response
good because the server is not going to
respond with the nothing now since we
have changed the route function let's go
to a router module and pass this new
response object and if we have a handler
for a URL then you need a response
object and if you don't have an app if
you don't have a handler then we're
going to say respond start right head
and the status is going to be 404 so 404
and then content type is going to be
text slash plane then response dot right
we're going to say error 404 page not
found but finally let's aim the response
now save it and we need to finally
change or handler code now if you
remember the original requirement it
said that when the user visits the home
page then he should be having a review
form where
the user can type in a review and then
click on the submit button so I have
already a hit steam of HTML file so
instead of having to type it out all
over again let me just copy and paste it
so in our home handler create a new
variable HTML file and this is equal to
the content so let me just quickly go
through what this HTML file is now
nothing in the head tag that body we are
going to be including a new form now
when the user clicks on the submit
button it's going to take them to the
URL slash review and we are going to
have a text area provided to them and
this text area is where they're going to
write the review and then we have a
submit button that is going to take them
to the review URL so simple enough now
in our home function let's pass the
response object and then we are going to
say response dot right head that the
status was ok so 200 then the content
type is going to be the content type is
going to read this time takes last HTML
so text slash HTML then let's write out
this response dot write this HTML file
and then let's end the response is a
response dot and now we can have this
HTML code in a separate file but I
wanted to keep it simple and I have
included it and the handler file so
Hamlet doll chest is going to be saved
save AB dot yes so Vijay roger-dodger so
Hannah go Jess now when you run node apt
archer as you understand the server
we refresh our homepage we get a text
box so say requests received for whole
routing a request for home and then we
are excluding the home handler I am if I
type a review this is a review click on
submit text now if you go back to your
browser it says request received or the
review URL of the path and routing a
request for a review path and then
executing the review handler now in a
review handler we are not doing anything
right now so in the next video
let us find let us build a final part of
our application and display the sub
display the review that the user
submitted from our home page so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
the next video and don't forget to
subscribe
