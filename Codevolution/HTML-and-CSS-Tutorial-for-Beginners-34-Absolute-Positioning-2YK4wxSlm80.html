positioning is absolute positioning and
this allows you to literally place any
element where you want it to be so let
me explain with an example how absolute
positioning works so let's create a
class for absolute positioning so dot
ABS POS just like relative positioning
and we use the same property here again
so position and this time the value is
going to be absolute now let's specify a
top but that'd be 200 pixels or let's go
at 50 pixels let's keep it smaller and
then from the left once again 80 pixels
all right now let's create a paragraph
tag and we can have let's say this is a
paragraph when you save it and reload it
we have at the way top this is a
paragraph and we have not quite applied
the class yet so let's apply class is
equal to a vs BOS and when we save it
now check out check it out so this is a
paragraph has been shifted 80 50 pixels
from the top and 80 pixels from the left
but this time it is going to be shifted
from the top left corner of your screen
so from the top left or from the top it
is 108 of 50 pixels and from the left it
is 80 pixels and unlike the relative
positioning with which shifts the
position based on its original position
absolute positioning shifts based on the
left top corner of your screen so that
is kind of like the origin for absolute
positioning now you can combine relative
and absolute positioning and that can be
very helpful so let's say we have a div
tag let's let's create a div tag style
so let's give it
a position and this time its relative
and let's create a border for it so a
border is two pixels solid black let's
give it a height let's let this be 500
pixels and a width which can also be 500
pixels now let's enclose this paragraph
within a div tag so dev and then the end
of this a closing though all right now
observe the change when you refresh it
there you go so what happens with
absolute positioning and relative
positioning is when you have a relative
positioning to this div tag and an
absolute positioning to this paragraph
within the div tag then the paragraph is
going to shift 50 pixels from the top
from this particular div tag and not
from the top of your screen and 80
pixels from the left from this div tag
border and not from the left of not from
the left of the screen so for example if
we move our div tag top let's say 100
pixels and left 100 pixels now when you
save it and refresh it there you go the
div tag shifted by 100 pixels from its
original position so from the left
hundred pixels from the top hundred
pixels but this is a paragraph is it is
going to maintain its distance of fifty
pixels and 80 pixels from the border of
this div tag and not from the top of the
screen or the or from the left of the
screen so by combining the do sorry by
combining absolute and relative
positionings you can have a lot of
flexibility with how you position your
elements
on your web page and they're really
really helpful now there's one more type
of positioning called fixed positioning
and let's see about that in the next
video so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
