to a brand new tutorial series on NPM
for beginners in this video I'm going to
briefly talk to you about what NPM s and
as we progress through the series we
will learn the basic usage of NPM now if
you're a JavaScript developer or
recently dived into the world of node.js
then the term NPM is no stranger to you
NPM all in lower cases is the package
manager for JavaScript so let's try to
understand what we mean by a package
manager now when we have a problem to
solve we end up writing the code to
address that specific problem and if we
encounter the same problem later in a
different project let's say then we can
reuse that same piece of code so these
individual files containing reusable
code are called modules and a package is
nothing but a directory with one or more
modules and along with a special file
called package JSON and this file has
metadata about the package now I do need
to tell you that sometimes the word
package is interchangeably used with the
word module so please don't get confused
okay now that we know what a packages
let's try to understand how NPM helps
with managing these packages now let's
say you write the JavaScript code to
solve a particular problem so you're the
developer a you write some code and NPM
allows you to publish your code into the
NPM registry so that other developers
who are facing the same problem can just
reuse your code and whenever you make
updates to your code NPM makes it easy
for the developers who are dependent on
your code to check for those updates and
download them so that is basically what
NPM is
it is a way to share your code with
other developers and reuse the code from
other developers and easily manage the
different versions of your code so let's
get started with the rest of the series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
