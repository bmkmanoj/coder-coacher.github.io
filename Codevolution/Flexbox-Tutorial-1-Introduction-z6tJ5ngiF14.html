to a brand new tutorial series on
flexbox in this video I'm going to
briefly introduce you to flex box and in
the rest of the series we are going to
learn how to make use of flex box for
building layouts so what is flex box the
CSS flexible box module are simply known
as flex box is a one dimensional layout
model that makes it easy to design
flexible and efficient layouts
distribute space among items and control
their alignment in a given container a
before flex box there were four layout
modes block for sections in a web page
in line for text table for
two-dimensional table data and
positioned for explicit positioning of
an element but these layouts did not
provide enough flexibility we had to
find all kinds of hacks to get the
layout just the way we wanted
working with floats trying to vertically
align the content trying to create equal
height columns they were kind of a
nightmare the Flex layout on the other
hand provides a lot of flexibility with
flex box we can arrange items left to
right right to left top to bottom or
bottom to top and at the same time
control the spacing alignment and order
of items in the container besides all
these advantages bootstrap 4 is built on
top of the Flex layout now that is a
pretty good reason to learn flex box and
to be honest it has sort of become a
must know for front-end developers in
2018 alright that is a brief
introduction to the what and why of flex
box in the next video let's understand
some terminology related to flex box
that is essential to understand how the
flex box CSS properties work on a side
