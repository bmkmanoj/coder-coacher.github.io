be learning about the class body and the
method definitions now the class body is
the part within the curly braces so this
right here is the class body for the
person class and in es2015 and not
typescript bear in mind a class body can
contain only methods and not properties
and in this video we are going to be
learning about three types of methods
now the first one is a constructor
method and a constructor method is used
for creating and initializing an object
and for every class that can only be one
constructor so let's create one for the
person class our constructor is going to
accept a name as a parameter and it's
going to assign this dot name with name
now if I hover over it it says property
name does not exist on type person now
I'm not really sure why typescript flex
this as an error because this is valid
es2015 code and in fact typescript does
compile this to es valid es5 code so
we're just going to ignore this for the
time being so we have a constructor
which accepts a name and assigns this
add name with name so now that we have a
constructor let's go ahead and
instantiate this class let P equals new
person let's pass the name as chandler
all right now when we save this okay let
me just add a log so that we can have a
look at the output we can call this to
be this dot name plus constructor so
let's save this there you go
Chandler constructor so a constructor
method is invoked as soon as you
instantiate the class so we're here
we're going to be calling this dot name
constructor since we are passing
Chandler we are calling Chandler
constructor and the second type of
method is the static method which can be
called without instantiating a class now
to declare our starting method we use
the static keyword followed by the name
of the method let's just go with the
static method now here let's just log to
the console static method now instead of
using P dot static method we need to
call it directly from the class so
person that static method when I save
this we have channel constructor and
then we have static method so this is
the second type of method now the third
type is the prototype method which we've
been seeing all along so we can have
greet person and this is just going to
log hello
this dot name now over here we can call
P dot greet person so let's save this
there you go hello Chandler so we have
three types of methods the first one is
the constructor method which is called
during object creation and second type
is the static method which can be called
directly with the help of a class and
not the object and finally we have the
prototype methods which can be called
with each object so that's pretty much
it for this video thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
