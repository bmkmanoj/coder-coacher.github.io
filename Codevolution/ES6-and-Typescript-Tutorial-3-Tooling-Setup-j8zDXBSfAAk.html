have a look at the tooling setup now the
first thing we need is some editor to
write our code and the second thing we
need is the types of compiler to
transpile our code and finally we will
put this two together and configure our
editor to work with the typescript
compiler now for this series I'm going
to be using we else code or Visual
Studio code now this is a great editor
with Auto completion and intellisense
but feel free to use sublime text or
webstorm or Adam just make sure you
install the typescript plug-in as well
next thing we need to do is install
typescript with NPM and for those of you
who are new to the world NPM and PMS
node package manager and it is a package
manager that is going to help manage our
dependencies now go to node.js or G and
download and install the latest and
stable version of node and by doing so
we are we are also going to be
installing NPM so I've already done this
and next step is I've created a new
folder called es2015 on my desktop and I
have navigated to this folder so we're
here I'm going to open command window
and type NPM install type script - G now
this is going to globally install
typescript for us with the help of NPM
as I mentioned now to save us some time
I've already executed this command but
please go ahead and execute this on your
machine okay so now that we have
installed typescript compiler let us see
how you configure it with our editor so
we're here in Visual Studio code I have
ES 115 folder opened and type control
shift B not type rather it is I mean
press control shift B and it is going to
say that a node task runner configured
now click on configure task runner and
select types good with
watch mode now this is going to create a
new task JSON for us in our folder so go
ahead and save this and finally we need
a configuration file for a typescript
compiler so go back to our folder over
here and in the command window type PS c
which is typescript compiler dash dash
in it now this is going to create a TS
config JSON file so let me open this
over here now this is a configuration
file for the types of compiler so it has
some configurations like the target is
going to be es 5 and then there's also
the source map over here and we are
going to change this to true so that we
have a mapping from the typescript find
to the JavaScript file which is going to
help us with the debugging and I'm also
going to add another out there over here
and specify this is going to be scripts
folder so create a new me the type suit
compiler is going to create a new folder
called scripts and this is where all the
transpiled javascript is going to exist
so we'll have our types of files right
over here in our 2015 folder but all the
JavaScript file is going to go inside a
separate folder called scripts this is
just to help us organize our code more
efficiently now let me create a new file
called demo dot TS and over here let me
create let me just type console dot log
and HelloWorld okay now when I save this
and hit on ctrl shift B it says
compilation complete watching for file
changes okay let me terminate this
running task and let me build it again
okay so compilation complete and
watching for file changes and if you see
here it queer
a new folder for us scripts and it has
created the demo GS from the demo dot ts
file and we also have the mapping file
but it is only going to help us with the
debugging so we're here in our demo
Dodgers
it has inserted the line console dot log
hello world now this is the same in ES
115 as it is in es5 so we don't see any
difference in the code but we will see
in the future videos okay so we have our
Visual Studio code editor we have
installed typescript compiler we have
added a build step so that every time
you make a change is going to compile
the file and finally we need an index
dot HTML file which is going to
reference this JavaScript so create a
new file called index dot HTML now we're
here I'm quickly going to install I'm
going to type out some code HTML head
and script now within script this source
is going to be equal to where do we have
it
script / demo dot J s because the
JavaScript is the one which is going to
be running in our browser so type is
equal to text slash JavaScript now let's
save this now the two things that we can
do right now we can directly okay did I
not save it okay I okay let me change it
let it save it okay this got over here
so let me change it to the 2015 folder
so now we have our index.html so we can
open it and then I type or hit on f12
and open console we have hello world but
if you see here the path is from our
file system and what would be better is
to serve our index dot HTML from a
server so go back to our es2015 folder
and type NPM install light server - gee
now this going to install light server
which
a server basically and it is going to
install it globally now I have already
done this so once you execute that
command you can type light server ok we
are going to take a few seconds and open
the close 3000 and now when I click on
console we still have hello world so
that's pretty much it the setup we have
to run es 2015 and typescript now I know
this was a tedious job but this is
required to start working with
typescript but if you are interested
let's say in learning just es 2015 for
now and want to hold on to es typescript
then watch the next video because I have
a different setup that is going to be
very easy for you to start working with
es 2015 so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
