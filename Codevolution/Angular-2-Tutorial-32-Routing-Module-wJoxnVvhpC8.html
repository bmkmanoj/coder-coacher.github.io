the basics of routing and navigation now
although our code works perfectly fine
right now there is a better and
recommended way to write code related to
routing so in this video we are going to
reorganize the existing code by moving
the routing functionality to a separate
file so I've created a new file called
app routing module dot es and we are
going to move away all the routing code
from AB dot module dot es to app routing
dot module dot GS so let's see how to do
that the first thing we need to do is
make sure we have all the imports so we
are going to need the entry module
decorator for our component we need the
router module of course and then we also
use routes to strongly type our routes
for the application and we'll see this
in just a bit we then import all the
components that we need to navigate to
right now our application has just the
two components employee list component
and department list component so we make
sure that we have imported these two
components now the next step is to
configure our routes so I am going to
create a new constant called routes and
this I'm going to strong type to be off
route from angular slash router package
and then I'm going to configure this
constant with all the routes for our
application so the path Department is
going to display department list the
path employees is going to show employee
list and this is exactly the same thing
that we have done over here in AB dot
module so router router module dot for
route we have configured here and I've
just added a constant and I've
configured that constant with the routes
now the next step is to add our
approaching module component so export
class uploading module and then we make
use of the NC module decorator that we
have imported to add some metadata to
this class so what are we adding we add
an imports array and in exports array in
the imports are a we are going to use
router module which have imported and on
the router module we use the forward
method and then pass in this constant
that we have configured so this routes
we are configured with the path and the
same thing we are going to specify here
and if you look at AB dot module dot es
router router module dot for route and
then we have the path and if we go back
here router module dot forward I have
all the paths so now this router module
is localized only to a protein dot
module dot es so we need to make sure
that other modules or other components
can make use of this so I'm also going
to export this router module that I have
just configured so now we have the a
protein module configured with this ng
module decorator that contains all the
routes for our application and the next
thing we are going to do is also declare
a new constant routing components and we
are going to specify all the components
that we are going to navigate to and
this is just maybe a slight improvement
in code because I'm going to show you in
just a bit so this is basically the
approaching dot module dot es all the
imports configure the roads add it to
router module and then export it and any
now any confident that you need to
navigate to just declare it in an array
called routing components so now let's
go back and make changes to AB dot
module dot Jia's because we should not
have routing code in two different
places now the first thing we need to do
is import approaching dot module dot yes
so over here on the router module I'm
going to import a p-- routing module I'm
going to import this from add dot slash
app routing dot module the next thing is
we are going to have to specify our
approaching module in the imports array
so now I don't need this a router module
dot for route anymore because that is
happening in the a protein module so I'm
going to remove this and add a protein
module now the next thing is we need to
declare all the confidence that we are
making use of and if you have a look
here we have Department list component
employee list component and I need to
import it again over here and right here
employ less confident and Department
list component so instead I can remove
these two and I can even remove these
two now I can combine this into a single
component I'm going to say routing
components let me just have a look what
it is alright routing components so I'm
going to copy this and in our module dot
es I'm going to paste it here and then
I'm going to import the same thing so
import routing components from dot slash
and I'm going to just copy will copy
this so there you go we have moved our
routing to a separate file so let's save
this and give it a go let me see there
you go our routing application is loaded
I'm just going to navigate to the closed
3000 so we have departments and
employees I click on departments I get
the Department list and also the URL
changes and click on employees employee
list component is displayed and the same
is reflected in the URL so this is how
it works we configure the routes we add
it to the router module this router
module is attached to the applauding
module class through ng module decorator
and any components we are navigating to
we are going to specify in routing
components array so back in AB dot
module dot yes I just have to import
this new file uploading module from
uploading module file and then I'm going
to add it in
ports array and then in the declarations
I'm just going to declare all the
components that we are going to navigate
to so that is basically how you move
your code from AB dot module dot es to a
separate uploading module dot es so by
doing this we have actually separated
our routing concerns from the different
features in our application for example
the department list component or
employee list component and we also have
a common place for all the application
level routing functionality so when you
create a new application and you you
have to make use of routers this is the
approach that you have to take alright
that's pretty much it for this video
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
