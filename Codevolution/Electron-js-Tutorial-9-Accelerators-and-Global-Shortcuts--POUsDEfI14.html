about accelerators and global shortcuts
in electron accelerators is just a fancy
term for a keyboard shortcut so you can
customize your application to have
shortcuts so that you can just work with
the keyboard as well a practical example
is the copy and paste commands we seldom
use mouse clicks and often use ctrl + C
and ctrl + R each shortcuts to perform
the copy/paste operations so shortcuts
are definitely useful in any application
and let's learn how we can create them
in electron now I will continue with the
menu demo application for this
particular video as well so if you have
a look at the Edit menu you can see the
keyboard shortcuts right next to the sub
menus so undo is ctrl z redo is
controlled Y and so on and if you have a
look at the code within our template so
if I expand the template you can see
that the Edit menu is built using the
roads so if you build a menu using roads
you don't have to specify keyboard
shortcuts electron adds them for you
however many at times you will build
custom menus and might want to assign
your own keyboard shortcuts so let's see
how to assign a shortcut to one of the
sub menus so we have our help menu let's
slightly modify this till this help menu
I'm going to add a sub menu so sub menu
there's going to be an array and within
the array we are going to specify one
single sub menu the label is going to be
about electron and then I'm going to
assign this click handler so we have our
help menu and within the help menu we
have a sub menu which is about electron
and when you click on that it is going
to open in the browser this particular
link now to assign a shortcut to this
particular sub menu we use the keyword
ax
later followed by the combination of
keys that have to be pressed so
accelerator and I'm gonna assign command
or control so based on Windows or Mac
machine + Shift + H so ctrl shift H is
going to open this particular URL so
let's restart our application and test
this out ctrl C to cancel it and p.m.
start again so now if you have a look
we have about Elektra and you can see
the shortcut mentioned right next to the
label control shift edge so I can open
the website by clicking on this
particular menu submenu or I can press
control shift age and it still does the
same so we have created a shortcut for
our submenu so this is how you would
assign a keyboard shortcut to one of
your sub menus so just specify the key
word accelerator followed by the
combination of keys that have to be
pressed now here's the thing this
shortcut works only when your
application is in focus it will not work
for example if I am actively working in
Visual Studio code so over here if I
press control shift age you can see that
I get search and replace so it doesn't
work when your application is not in
focus but then again you might build an
application where you might want a
keyboard shortcut to work even when your
application is not in focus a practical
example is when your application is
supposed to capture your screen so your
app might never be in focus it might be
running in the background so let's see
how to register global shortcuts a
shortcut which works even when your
application is out of focus is called a
global shortcut in electron now to
create a global shortcut we first need
to import
the sub-module from electron so over
here I'm going to say Const global
shortcut is equal to electron dot global
shortcut and then within app dot on
ready let's register our global shortcut
so we are going to specify global
shortcut dot register so when you invoke
the register method you can register
global shortcuts
now the first parameter is a string
which is the combination of keys for
this particular shortcut so I'm going to
say this is alt plus 1 and then we're
going to have a function that gets
executed when this combination of keys
are pressed and I'm just going to say
window dot show so if the window is in
the background it is going to bring it
it is going to bring the focus to that
particular window basically what this
does is when you press alt + 1 it brings
your application into focus so let's say
you are working on some other
application and want to quickly take a
look at your application you can just
press alt + 1 let's test this out so I'm
going to restart the application and
p.m. start now over here we have our
application in focus so I'm going to
minimize this and then now I'm going to
press alt 1 and you can see that it
brings it into focus
so our global shortcut is working now
this is a basic example but you can
perform any logic or operation or fire
any event using global shortcuts but one
thing you have to make sure is when you
close your application these shortcuts
are unregistered so for that so we are
going to specify app dot on will quit a
function and then global shortcut dot
unregister all so when your app is going
to quit it is going to unregister
all the global shortcuts so that is
pretty much how you create shortcuts
and global shortcuts in your electron
application for a shortcut you just
specify the keyword accelerated followed
by the combination of keys that have to
be pressed and for a global shortcut we
first need to require the global
shortcut module and then in AB dot on
ready method we are going to have global
shortcut register to register a global
shotgun they specify the combination of
keys and what is the functionality for
that particular global shortcut so in
our example all +1 will bring a browser
window into focus and you also have to
make sure that you unregistered
all the global shortcuts that have been
registered in your application when you
quit that application so that is about
shortcuts let's take a look at shell
module in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
