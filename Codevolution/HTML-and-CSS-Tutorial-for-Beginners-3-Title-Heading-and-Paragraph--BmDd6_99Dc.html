that while we're in the process of
learning the different HTML tags why not
simultaneously build a cool web page so
let's stick to the basics since we are
beginners after all and create a web
page on the TV show friends now the very
first thing we need to do is specify a
title for our web page and specify a
title we make use of the title tag I'll
tell that the title tag always goes
within the head tag so open and close
the title tag and within these two tags
specify the title so let's say friends
by joke mom and this is going to be the
title for our web page if we go ahead
and save it and here's what I want you
to notice now see at the very top it
says indexed on HTML and when you reload
it it changes to friends by joy bond and
this is the title of the web page now
title is what is usually displayed in
the search results so having an
appropriate title it's very very
important now coming to our next time
coming to our next time if you guys have
read the newspapers or at least have
have a look at it at some point of time
then there are usually these headlines
which are huge and bold and below that
we have a paragraph describing the
headline so for our web page let's
create a heading and a paragraph now a
heading comes in six different sizes and
it is usually specified using the
following tags now let's remove this
hello world and create our first heading
tag our heading tag has six different
sizes as you see here and the first one
is the h1 tag and this is the largest of
them all so let us say friends or as the
so you specifies an F our IP and the s
now the friends it's going to appear
something like this so friends is big
and it's bold now there are also five
other sizes in which you can specify the
heading and let me quickly type it out
now h1 is the biggest of them all and
then they go all the way till eight six
and the size decreases as we move from
one to six
so just for comparison I have h1 to h6
and if you reload it you can see that
friends is the biggest of them all with
H 1 and H 6 is the smallest of them all
now it is very important to keep in mind
that HTML headings have to be used for
headings only you do not use it to make
some random text up your big or bold
because search engines use these
headings to index the structure and
content of our webpage so anyway let's
create two new paragraphs below our
heading so let me let's say let's stick
to h2 tag and remove the other tags
now let me create two new paragraphs
let me type friends as an American TV
show and then another paragraph the show
revolves on six friends living in
Manhattan all right now let's go ahead
and save it and see how that appears in
our web page hmm there's something
interesting now if you notice even
though we have left plenty of space
between each of our paragraphs HTML
being whitespace insensitive is going
to ignore it so any amount of space that
is between this that what that was there
between these two paragraphs were
deleted by HTML and then is going to
display it and one single line so what
we need here is a paragraph tag now a
paragraph tag is denoted by the P tag so
open a paragraph tag and then close the
paragraph tag now similarly for our
second paragraph open the paragraph tag
and then close the paragraph tag now let
us save it when we reloaded we have two
separate paragraphs so friends is an
American TV show this paragraph number
one and then the show revolves around
six rounds living in Manhattan is
paragraph number two so just to quickly
recap what we have learned so far
we use a title tag to specify a title
for our webpage and then we use a
heading tag that has a range of sizes
from h1 to h6 to specify your heading in
our web page then we make use of a P tag
or the paragraph tag to specify
paragraphs within our webpage so I hope
