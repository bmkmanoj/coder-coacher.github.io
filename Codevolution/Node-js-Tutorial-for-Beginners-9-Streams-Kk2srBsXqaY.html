previous video we learned about the FS
core module for file i/o and in this
video we are going to be making use that
module to learn about streams now
streams are nothing but UNIX UNIX pipes
that allow us to read data from a source
and then pipe the data to a destination
very easily now we have two types of
streams actually three but we are going
to be learning only about two types of
streams the first one is a readable
stream that lets you read data from a
source and then the second one is a
writable stream that lets you write data
to a destination okay now to make use of
streams we first need to import the FS
module so very well FS is equal to
require FS and then we are going to
create a readable stream so very well
readable stream is equal to FS dot
create read the stream we also need to
specify from where we are reading so
it's going to be infant dot txt now we
also are going to get some data after
reading it so first let us initialize
the data and then we are going to set
the format so readable stream dot set
encoding and that's how a UDF ate now
streams are also event emitters so we
can listen to an event when they emit
and then perform some action so readable
streams emit data and an end event so
it's a readable string dot on so streams
are going to read the data from a file
bit by bit and not the entire file at a
time
so rebel stream on data
we are going to call a function when
this data event is emitted and that is
going to take a parameter chunk and we
are going to keep adding this chunk to
our data to finally have the entire
content of our input txt so data plus is
equal to chunk and then we can have
another event so readable stream that on
this is the end of reading the file so
we can have another function that just
says console dot log and the data that
has been read okay
and when we go ahead and save it and
open you know command prompt node dot
yes so this is the input file contains
nothing useful just read the stuff so
this is a content from our input dot txt
so what readable streams do is read data
from a file and then based on the events
they emit we can call back certain
functions and similarly we have a
writable stream so let's say variable
right data wide data is equal to hello
world so this is the data we are going
to be writing out your file and then
variable writable stream as equal to FS
dot create right stream now we also need
to specify the file where we are going
to write our data so output dot txt okay
then we need to specify that we are
going to be writing data in the utf-8
format so writable stream dot right we
are going to write data and then you'd
hear eight
I'm at semicolon and finally we are
going to listen to an event okay before
that we just are going to say and
there's going to be the end and then
when they're going to be listening to an
event called finish so when writing data
to the output file is finished then
let's just say function console dot log
write completed so save it and if we go
back to your command prompt
there it is so it says write completed
and then this is the input file contains
nothing useful just read the stuff and
if you go back to your folder we have an
output dot txt file created and if we
open it we have hello world now once
again we see that the callbacks come
into action now even though we are
reading data from the file and trying to
log that into your console this is an
event so an asynchronous function is
going to happen and we are going to be
if we have a look at the command prompt
we see that right completed which is
write completed is the first thing that
is printed so while we are reading data
from the input file we don't want the
execution to be blocked so we make use
of events to let the server know that
print onto the console the data only
when it is available and we are going to
be writing the data first and then
reading it reading on the input file
anyway so I hope that was not confusing
but it's always preferable to use
streams to read data and then write
because reading data and streams happens
in chunks and not the entire file at
once
so imagine if you have a few megabytes
for a file and that takes a lot of time
so instead we are going to receive it
part by part and then add it all
together and then you know you can write
that right that write the data on to the
console so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
