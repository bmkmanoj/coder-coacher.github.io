I just wanted to let you know that for
this topic alone that is about modules
in es2015
I'm going to be making use of tracer as
the transpiler instead of typescript why
let me explain
now when we are dealing with modules
there are two things to keep in mind the
first one is the module syntax now the
module syntax is the standard module
syntax that es2015 is going to provide
and is going to be the main focus for
our learning in the next videos and we
also have module loading so once we have
the modules we need to load those
modules onto our browser now for this
there is no standard yet and it is still
a work in progress so at this point of
time it doesn't really matter if you use
tracer or Babel or typescript for module
loading but for me personally I felt
that if I was a beginner then learning
with tracer was much more simpler now so
what is the initial set up that has to
be done for loading modules with tracer
now step one create a folder so I have
created a new folder called es modules
and within this module or navigate to
this module and open command prompt and
run this command and PM installed es6
module loader tracer system gears now
all these three are required to load our
modules so when you execute that an own
modules folder is going to be created
with all the three es6 module loader
system J's and tracer so that is the
first step create a folder and run the
command now our second step create an
index dot HTML file with the following
lines of code now I am going to have
this on my github so not to worry now
the first script link is for tracer the
second script link is for system J's and
the third link is for es6 module loader
and
the body tag we have written another
piece of line called system a system
don't import source folder module HS
which brings us to our third step create
a folder called SRC or source in the es6
modules folder and within that I have
created two JavaScript files module a
DHS and module B dodges now module b gs
is very going to write pieces of code
and export it so that module
Aegeus can import it so three steps
create a folder on the command second
step create index our HTML with
following lines of code
third step create a folder called source
with module 8 rj s and model video chess
so with these things in mind from next
video let's understand the standardised
syntax for modules in es2015 so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
