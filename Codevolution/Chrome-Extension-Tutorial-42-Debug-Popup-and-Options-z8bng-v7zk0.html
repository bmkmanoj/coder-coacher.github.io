extensions let's learn how to debug them
because debugging is very crucial to
understanding where your code is going
wrong and I'm making a basic assumption
that you are used to debugging regular
web applications and want to learn
debugging Chrome extensions in specific
all right so if you open the developer
tools and have a look at the elements or
the CSS you don't find the HTML or CSS
related to the Chrome extension so these
elements you don't find them over here
so to debug an extension we need to
right click on this icon and then select
inspect pop-up and now it opens a new
window from where we can see all the
elements so for example this each one
gets highlighted over here in the
extension if I if I hover over each one
the same with h2 or the infidel iment
and for example I can select each one
and add a style as well so let's say
color and let's give it Orange and there
you go each one is now changed to orange
color and if you go to sources okay let
me - let me just open it again I'm not
sure why it didn't pop up alright so
let's go to sources and now you see that
pop up yes which is that which is the
JavaScript where pop-up dot HTML is
visible so if a good pop up yes and
let's say our code is going wrong and we
need to figure out where it is going on
so I'm going to set a breakpoint here
and I'm going to enter an amount so 10
and click on spend and there you go it
hits the debug point and now I can hold
our to check a canoe total I'm getting
the existing total of 30 from chrome
storage ok that is working fine and if I
hover over mount I get the value of 10
which is the value entered so that is
working fine and then I can move on to
the next step and then the new total is
going to be 40 that needs to be updated
so this is basically how we are going to
debug your JavaScript
and when it comes to your options page
it is pretty simple so if I right-click
and select options is going to open a
new tab altogether and now if I click on
if I press f12 I get elements so I can
select h1 h2 the two input buttons so if
I go to the sources tab I get options
yes so again I can I can have a debug
point over here when I click on reset
total and if I click on reset it pauses
in the debugger and I can move through
the different steps so this is basically
how you are going to debug your pop-up
and your options page and we'll learn
about debugging the background pages and
content scripts in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
