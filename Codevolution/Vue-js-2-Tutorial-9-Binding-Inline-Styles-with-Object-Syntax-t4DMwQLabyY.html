instead of inline styles we do end up
using them under some circumstance so in
this video I'll show you how to bind to
inline styles in UJS and there are two
ways to bind to the style attribute the
first one is the object syntax and the
second one is the arrow syntax let's
take a look at object syntax first with
an example now as the name suggests with
the object syntax we bind the style
attribute with a javascript object so
let's say we have an h1 tag and to this
h1 tag we have some inner HTML that says
inline now let's say we need to bind a
color to this element so for that let's
declare a new data property and assign a
value now I'm gonna call this highlight
color and let's give it a color of
orange now to bind this color to our h1
tag we are first going to use the V bind
directive followed by the attribute
which is the style attribute and then -
this time attribute we assign a
JavaScript object and this object will
have name value pairs the name will be
the CSS property so color and then the
value will be the data property that we
have declared so highlight color so
basically at runtime highlight color
which is nothing but orange will be
bound to the color property of the style
attribute so let's save this and refresh
our browser and you can see that the
heading tag is now in orange color and
if you have a look each one has an
inline style color set to orange let's
add another property and this time let's
add the font size so I'm going to put a
comma and say header size and set this
to 50 now to bind this header size to
our h1 element I'm going to add a comma
and over here I'm gonna say font size
with a colon and then the data property
that we have declared so header size
and of course you need to append pixels
as the unit so Plus pixels so let's save
this and refresh our browser and take a
look well something has gone wrong
because we can't see any HTML at all and
if you're wondering why let me point out
the culprit if you take a look at the
style binding we have specified font -
size however JavaScript variables cannot
accept a - so come up casing does not
work now to overcome this there are two
options the first one is to enclose font
size within single quotes so now you can
save this refresh the browser and it's
going to work because in the inline
style it says font size 50 pixels or the
second option is to change kebab casing
to camel casing so you can replace font
- size with font size with an uppercase
s so come up casing - camel casing so
let's save this and refresh and you can
see that it still works the font size of
50 pixels is applied along with the
color orange - this heading tag also
keep in mind you can specify static
values as well for example if you know
for a fact that this element must have a
padding of let's say 20 pixels you can
just add it directly not all values have
to be dynamic so I can put a comma
padding and then colon and then set it
to 20 pixels now if I save this and
refresh the browser you can see that a
padding of 20 pixels has been added or
applied to this heading tag so you can
bind dynamic values as well as static
values now binding styles this way works
just fine
but as a number of properties increases
the template becomes fluttered for
example if there were 10 additional
properties your template will probably
not look clean at all so to make things
cleaner or to provide for a cleaner
template
view allows us to directly bind a style
object so let's take a look at an
example and understand what the style
object is so in the data property we
create another name value pair let the
name be header style object and the
value will be an object that in turn
contains CSS properties as name value
pairs
so let's recreate this same h1 element
styles so that you can compare the two
approaches and see how clean the
template looks with the style object
approach color is going to be orange
font size is going to be 50 pixels and
then a padding of 20 pixels let's create
a new h1 element now to bind this style
object we are going to use the V bind
directive again and we are going to use
the style attribute again but this time
instead of binding an object we directly
bind to this header style object so I'm
going to paste this over here and I'm
gonna name this style object so let's
save this go back over here and refresh
our browser and you can see that we have
created the style object and if you
notice I in line Styles both of them
have the exact same inline styles but if
we go back to the code you can clearly
see that the second HTML element is much
easier to read than the first one so my
advice would be if you have a single
inline property you can go with the
first approach but if you have multiple
inline style properties definitely go
with the style object approach gather
all your CSS properties create a
JavaScript object out of it and then
bind the JavaScript object directly to
the style attribute so much more cleaner
and readable code can be created using
the style object well this is about the
object syntax for applying inline styles
to
HTML elements let's take a look at the
array syntax in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
