released
and that means we can resume on the
angular 2 series but let me tell you
that if you watch this series so far
except for a small change with the hello
world example and how you nest component
everything else remains the same so in
this video I'm going to explain the new
hello world application and in the
subsequent videos we can focus on the
other major concepts like forms routing
services and build a few angular
applications alright now I have this
basic hello world application you can
download this from my github repo and
the folder is angular 2 final template
and I have opened this folder in Visual
Studio code now to run the application
you need to first run npm install and
then you need to run NPM start so once
you run that you have hello world
displayed in your browser so how does
this application work let's have a look
so we start off this we start off with
this app dot module dot ES file and this
is the entry point to our application so
here we make use of the anti module
decorator to add some metadata for our
app module class now we import the
browser module because our application
runs on the browser and then we declare
the list of components that are part of
this app module so for now we just have
the one app component declared and
finally we bootstrap the app component
which is the root component for our
application so that's about the app dot
module dot ES file next let's have a
look at this app component file so app
component dot es now the app component
is the root component of our application
the first thing we need to do is import
the component decorator so that we can
use it with the app component class now
we specify a selector which behaves as
the HTML tag and we also specify the
template which is the view for this
component so when my ab tag is found it
is replaced with this hello world which
we use in index dot HTML so my app over
here
this is replaced by hello world which is
what we see on our browser and finally
we have this main dot ts file and here
is the code to initialize the platform
that our application runs in and we also
bootstrap the app module so let me go
over the flow of execution one last time
the main dot es is going to bootstrap
this app module and in our app module it
is going to bootstrap the app component
now app module is the root module and
app component is the root component and
this app component is now ready to be
rendered so anytime this selector
my app is encountered it is going to be
replaced with h1 tag hello world so in
index dot HTML when it identifies this
my app tag it is going to replace it
with the h1 tag and hello world is going
to be displayed on the browser now the
second thing is nesting component so
suppose we want to add a new component
which is going to be part of our root
component app component this one right
here first we need to create a file so
let's create it a sub component TS and
let's just copy this app component so
copy and let's go over to sub component
es paste it and let's just change this
to sub application and the view to sub
app and let's also change the class name
so sub component let's let me save this
and once we once you create a sub
component or another component you need
to head over to AB dot module dot es and
in the declarations section we need to
specify
that we also have another component so
sub component but now we have this red
squiggly over here that is because we
need to import the sub component so let
me copy and paste this and let's copy
this paste it and change this to sub
component so now when I save this and
head over to AB dot component ia's and
include the selector so it's going to be
sub app sub app now when I save this and
when the browser is refreshed we are
going to see sub app returned underneath
hello world so two main things we
covered in this video how to create a
simple hello world application and if
your application contains more than one
component how to add that component to
your root component and then the root
module alright that's pretty much it for
this video and thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
stay tuned for more videos from this
