and in this video we are going to be
learning about interfaces now interfaces
are the most flexible way of describing
types in typescript and because the type
information is erased from a typescript
program when we compile it we don't have
to worry about the runtime overhead we
are going to add when using interfaces
so let's have a look at the syntax to
define an interface we use the interface
keywords interface and this is followed
by the name for the interface I'm going
to create an interface of a person so a
person is going to have a first name
of type string a last name of type
string as well and age of let's say type
number now I can create available let
employee one and this employee is going
to be of type person so the interface
now this I can create first name and
this will be Chandler because it's a
string last name this is going to be
Bing which is a string again and H I'm
going to assign 30 so there you go we
have created an employee a new variable
of type person now if you if I let's say
remove this age 30 and this is going to
give a red squiggly for employee 1 and
it says that type first name string last
name string is not assignable to type
person because property age is missing
in this type so this critical interface
enforces that the first name last name
age must be present in this employee
so if we add age equals 30 then it works
fine so let's say we are creating
another employee employee - and this is
also of type person but this time we are
not sure of what the employee age is
let's go with
named Ross last name together but I'm
not really sure what the age is and
because I'm implementing or using the
interface I have to fill in this age but
I don't want to fill in an incorrect
data so in such a scenario when you want
to make a property optional we just have
to add this question mark next to the
particular property so now this property
age is optional so employee to with just
first name and last name is going to be
valid so the only purpose of using
interface and typescript is to describe
a particular type and you can specify
properties and this these are going to
be mandatory when we use the particular
interface type and if you add a question
mark next to your property then that can
be optional as you see here in employee
two so that's pretty much it for this
video thank you guys for watching don't
really subscribe and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
