now playing JavaScript objects are not
iterable so they don't work with the
four of loop by default so if we have an
object say person with the first name
and last name as the properties and when
we try to use a far-off loop with this
person by saying let P of person console
dot log P and when we run this and head
over to the console it says type error
person of symbol dot iterator is not a
function so the for off loop doesn't
work with objects by default so in this
video let us see how to make this person
object iterable now I already have the
code typed out and we are just going to
be going over the code and understanding
because it is very similar to what we
have learned in the last video now if
you recollect or if you even have a look
at the console it says person of symbol
dot iterator
is not a function so we start off by
defining a function at the key symbol
dot iterator for this person object so
our first line is going to be person of
symbol dot iterator is equal to a
function and this function we start off
by declaring three variables that we are
going to be making use of in this next
method so initially we are going to have
the properties equal to object keys and
pass this person object so properties is
going to contain first name and last
name and then we have a count variable
initialized to zero to keep track of the
count and we also have East done
variable which is going to be boolean
and set to false and that is going to
indicate if the iteration is complete or
not and if you recollect again from the
last video this method at the key symbol
dot iterator implements a next function
and this next function returns an object
so what this next function is going to
do is if the count is greater than the
number of property
for the person object it is going to say
is done equals true which means that the
iteration is complete and then we are
going to return done is going to be the
same as is done variable it's going to
be the true or false and the value is
going to be for this object the property
add count or the value at this
particular property so the property the
value at first name and value at last
name so let me just move this on top and
now when I run this and head over to the
console we have Chandler and Bing let me
clear this and run it again there we go
Chandler and Bing now that is how you
use objects with the for off loop you
need to define your own method at symbol
dot iterator key so that's pretty much
it for this video thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
