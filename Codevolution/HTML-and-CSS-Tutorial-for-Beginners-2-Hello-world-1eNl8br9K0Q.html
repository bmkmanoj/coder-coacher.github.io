previous video I have mentioned this
world tags a lot but what exactly are
these tags now a tag is nothing but a
keyword that is influenced between a
less intense sign and a greater than
sign these tags are like the building
blocks of HTML now each tag is usually
followed by some sort of content and
then the same exact tag but with a front
like front slash at the beginning now
the tag without the front slash is
called an opening tag whereas the tag
with the front slash is called a closing
tag and together the opening tag the
content and the closing tag is called an
HTML element now one last thing to
understand before we start coding our
website is the structure of an HTML file
now at the very beginning of our HTML
file we need to specify just once the
document type
so we have our lesser than sign and
greater than sign then we have an
exclamation sign at the beginning and
then we have a keyword doctype HTML now
this tag is used by the browser to
understand that the document type is
going to be HTML and the version of HTML
is html5 which is the current version
now the basic HTML page structure also
calls for three tags the first one is
the HTML tag now the HTML tag encloses
the complete HTML document so anything
HTML related has to go between these two
tags the second one is the head tag if
you want to specify a title for your web
page or include some data for search
engine optimization or any browser
related data is going to go between the
head tags and finally we have a body tag
and any visible content in our web page
must be enclosed within the body tag so
if you're expecting a visitor at home
and your living room is a mess then you
quickly hide
any unwanted stuff in the room so when a
visitor comes they're only going to be
viewing your living room and anything
else is going to be hidden from them now
similarly when a visitor arrives at your
webpage
anything that is visible to them will be
within the body tag and what the content
you don't want to show it to the visitor
is going to be between these head tags
and finally when you have to save an
HTML file you save it with a dot HTML
extension and since the landing page for
a website is usually index let's start
by creating a very first web page which
is going to be indexed not HTML so in
our in your text editor which is sublime
text for me I'm going to be creating a
new file and then saving it as index dot
HTML now as I said we have to first
specify the doctype which is going to be
HTML and then we specify the HTML tag
give a little space and then let us
close the HTML tag now it's a good
practice to open your tag and close it
at the same time so that you're not left
with unclosed
tags so I always do this I recommend you
to do the same as well so we have an
HTML opening tag and an HTML closing tag
then as we learned from the presentation
that we have and we have a head tag
where the browser related information
goes and then we have a body tag where
we specify content that is to be visible
to the user now for a very first webpage
let us go ahead and type hello world in
our body tag and when you go ahead and
save it go back to HTML and CSS folder
and when we click on index dot HTML we
see hello
written in our webpage and that's it you
have your very first web page now in the
next video we are going to start
learning a whole bunch of tags and learn
how to build more complex websites so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
