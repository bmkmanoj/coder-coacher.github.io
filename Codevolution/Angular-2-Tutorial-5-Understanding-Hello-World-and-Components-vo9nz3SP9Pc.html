we are going to understand how our hello
world application works that is a flow
of execution and also learn about
component now two files are going to be
of concern for us in this video that is
the AB component
TS which is our component file and main
dot TS now let's start with AB dot
comprehend or TS now if you recollect
from the architecture video I mentioned
that a component is nothing but a class
plus some metadata so this right here is
our class and the name of the class is
AB component and the metadata here is
the selector and a template which is
indicated by a component decorator now a
decorator is a feature of typescript and
this is going to attach this metadata to
the class underneath it so if you
specify a class with a component
decorator right above it then these two
are bound to each other now within our
decorator we I mean within our before
the metadata we specify two properties a
selector and a template now a selector
is nothing but the HTML tag that you are
going to be using in order to have this
component in your HTML tag and this
template is nothing but the HTML that
has to go in between your selected tags
so if you go to index dot HTML we have
the my app tag over here which is of
course not a default HTML tag this is a
custom tag nothing but the selector for
our component and between these two tags
we are going to be replacing it with
hello world
so going back to our up combo NTS we
also initially need to specify that we
are importing the class at the component
class from angular core module so just
to recollect sorry to put it in your
mind once again a class with some
metadata is called a component and to
use the component we have to import the
component class from angular core module
have it as a decorator and then specify
a selector which is nothing but the tag
which we which is going to be used as a
tag and then the template which is going
to be the HTML content then we have the
main dot TS now if you have okay so the
main dot TS is going to bootstrap our
app component so what is bootstrap
bootstrap meaning to say it is going to
start our app component or have it ready
for you now how does it do that
it is going to import the bootstrap
function from one of angular's the
modules once again and then it is going
to import our app component class or the
app component here so this class name is
going to import it from our current
folder so a dot and the slash means the
current folder we have a file called AB
component dot ts is what we are working
with but it is actually going to be
importing the J's file so let's come in
let me go back to this yeah
so we import the booster function we
import the app component and then we
just bootstrap the app component so that
we have it ready for use when required
now if you also yeah that's pretty much
it the two files I wanted to discuss so
let us see how the flow of execution
works - in order to display the hello
world when index dot HTML in our script
tag over here we say system dot import
app so it is configuration so it goes to
system GS config if we see
here it says for app our main file is
main dot J's so it goes to main dot yes
but we are going to be reading main dot
TS so it is going to bootstrap our app
component so we have our app component
which is going to be ready to use now
when we go back to our index dot HTML
the flow of execution comes within the
body tag and now it encounters the my
app HTML tag now this might app it
recognizes that it is nothing but a
selector for our component and it is
going to replace it with hello world so
there you go hello world is displayed
now two things I need to mention the
first one is in our main dot es if you
have a look we don't specify the
extension and it is JavaScript by
default because in our system yes config
we say that the default extension is GS
the second thing I want to specify is
about talked about as this loading right
here now this loading is going to be
displayed in two cases the first one is
when the app component is actually
getting loaded which we saw in the
previous video or in the second scenario
is when there is some error within our
app component and it is unable to load
the app component it is going to just
display loading dot dot so that's pretty
much it how a basic very basic angular
application works and what a component
is and also one last thing if you have a
component called
app component we usually have the
convention to name the file as app dot
component with a typescript extension of
course so yeah that's pretty much it I
hope you understood what a component is
as well this is the most basic of them
all and in the next video let us create
a very first component and understand
more about components in detail so just
first bit of the video so hello world
from Shoutmon if you save it I'm just
going to save it I'm not even going to
refresh the browser it is going to do it
automatically and display hello world
from joke mode so I'm going to wind it
up here thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
