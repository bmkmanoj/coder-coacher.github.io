we want to add some space around an
element then we make use of a property
called the margin property so to
demonstrate that first let's create two
paragraphs so 2 paragraph this is para
one and let's create another one this is
para tu para para paradise so let's
create a style for our property sorry
style for our elements which is the
paragraph element so the selector is
going to be P and what we are trying to
do is add some space around the element
so the margin property is going to be
suitable for that and let's specify all
right let me first actually remove this
save it and display okay we have this is
para 1 and this is para to now if we add
a property called margin and let's
specify 50 pixels and save it if you
reload it so there's a margin of 50
pixels around this element let me create
a border so that L is much more clearly
visible water 2 pixels solid red save it
reload it all right there you go so what
this margin does is from the border it
is going to leave 50 50 pixels on the
top 50 pixels on the left 50 pixels on
the bottom and 50 pixels on the right so
if i move my screen you can see here the
right side border there is 50 pixels
between where the browser ends and where
the border ends and you can also specify
a negative margin so that they're closer
than normal so let's say minus 5 pixels
so let's save it and reload it so you
see that this 2 paragraph
are closer than usual if I remove the
margin poverty save it and reloaded this
is the original spacing between the two
paragraph elements but yeah we could
also have margin for each side just like
padding so you can have margin margin on
the left and let's say 100 pixels save
it reloaded only a hundred pixel margin
is applied to the left hand side and
similarly you can have margin bottom
margin right and margin top so that's
pretty much it about the box model and
trust me you're going to be using the
margin and padding a lot when you're
developing websites it's going to be of
great use so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
