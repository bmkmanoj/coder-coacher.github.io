apply inline styles to HTML elements and
style binding is pretty similar to class
binding so let's dive right into an
example now I'm gonna add a new h2
element and let the text be style
binding let's say we want to bind to the
color CSS property for that here is the
syntax we start off with square brackets
within square brackets we are going to
say style followed by dot followed by
color which is the CSS property that we
want to bind to and to this we can
assign the color as a string value so
it's equal to double quotes within
double quotes single quotes and within
single quotes let's bind orange color so
if we save this and take a look at the
browser the element is now in orange
color all right now in style bindings it
is possible to use the conditional
operator to assign a value to the CSS
property for example we have styled
color so we are still binding to the
colored CSS property of this h2 element
but this time on the right hand side we
are going to have a conditional
expression so has error question mark
within single quotes red and then a
colon and then green so if the property
in the class has error is set to true
red color is applied else green color is
applied currently has error is set to
false so in the browser the text should
be in green color and if I change has
error to true in the browser style
binding should now be in red color all
right now you can also assign component
class properties during binding so let's
create another h2 tag let the text be
style binding to and let's create a new
property this is going to be public
highlight color
and set this to orange now let's bind
this property highlight color to the
color CSS property of this h2 element
and here's how you do it begin with
square brackets and within the square
brackets style followed by a dot
followed by the CSS property in our case
it is color and then to this we assign
the class property that we have just
created so it's equal to highlight color
so now if you take a look at the browser
you can see style binding to is
displayed in orange so by having a
property bound to this color style you
can change the highlight color to be any
color you want to based on user
interactions or state of your
application so this gives you a lot of
control and finally to apply multiple
styles we need to make use of the Indy
style directive and this is just like
the ng class directive so first let's
create an object with all the styles we
want to apply so this is going to be
public title styles let's give it a
color of blue and then font style of
italic and remember we cannot use - over
here so we need to use camel case font
style with an uppercase s and then we
create a new h2 element again style
binding 3 is the text and we can use the
ng style directive so within square
brackets we use the keyword ng style and
to this we bind the object that we have
just created so title styles so now if
you save this and take a look at the
browser you can see that the element has
a blue color with italic styling so
that's pretty much it about style
binding in angular thank you guys for
