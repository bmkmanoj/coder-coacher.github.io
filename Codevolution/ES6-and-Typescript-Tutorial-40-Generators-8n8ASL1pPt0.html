be learning about generators which is a
new feature in es2015 now about
functions one thing we are sure of is
that once they start executing it will
always run to completion before any
other code can run however es6 generator
is a special type of function which can
be paused in the middle of execution run
some other code and then resume the same
function from where we left off and this
pausing of execution is possible with
the help of a new keyword known as the
yield keyword so let's understand this
with an example now the syntax of a
generator is very much alike a function
so we just have the function keyword but
the only differences after the function
keyword we have an asterisk so function
asterisk and then name of the function
so let's have create generator as the
name and this is going to you make use
of this yield keyword and I'm going to
explain in just a minute what this means
after first yield and then we are also
going to have yield two so what we are
basically doing here is that in this
generator first we are going to yield
the value one this number one and then
the execution is going to pause and the
generator is going to resume its
execution when we again tell it to
continue its execution so then it's
going to execute these two lines of code
so console dot log as well as yield two
so basically with every execution it is
going to hit the next yield point so
this is going to be the point where this
function is going to pause so now we can
create a reference to this generator so
let my chain s equal to create the
generator and this is just going to
provide us with the reference it's not
going to start executing this function
now to invoke this function or start
execute
we need to call the next method on the
generator so my gen dot next so now when
I run this and head over to the console
we are provided with an object the value
is one and done this boolean flag set
default and this is very much like what
we saw with iterators so over here the
only difference is that done will be set
to false when it reaches the last yield
statement or there are no more yield
statements in this generator so I can
call this again so let's call it twice
and now let me also clear the console
and run this and there we go so object
value one done false so that was called
after this first next method and the
execution was paused and then these two
lines were executed for the next method
so we have after first yield an object
value - done false and finally when we
call this next method again it
identifies that there are no more yield
statements and hence done is set to true
and the value is undefined so only when
there are no more yields done is set to
true and the value is undefined so
basically generator is a special
function capable of pausing and resuming
execution with the help of this yield
keyword so now that we know that what a
generator is what do we use it for now
if you look here a generator returns an
object that provides the same next
method that is expected by a far-off
loop so generators can be used to
simplify our code when we write our
custom iterators for example a custom
iterator which you wrote in the last
video to iterate over an object so we
had this custom iterator in the last
video to iterate over a simple object
and instead of having to write so much
of code we can use a generator to
simplify this
and I have replaced it already so over
here the person symbol dot iterator
remains the same and we obtained all the
properties but from then on so count is
done an implementation of the next
method all that is handled by this
generator so I've replaced function by
just a function as tricks and properties
remains the same and now since we have a
collection of properties I can use a
far-off loop let T of properties and
then yield is going to be made use of so
this is going to yield each key and we
are going to be making use of the value
at each key so this is basically yield
first name and yield last name so now
the console is blank when I run this
head over to the console we get Chandler
and Bing so this is one really useful
feature of generator to be made use when
we write our custom iterators and there
there are a lot more or there is a lot
more two generators but I recommend you
to go through some online documents for
that and well that's going to be it for
this video thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
