20 now in EES 2015 we have a new far-off
statement and this is kind of a for loop
but it is used to loop over iterables
now we will learn about it revolt later
on in the video series but for now let
us see how to use the for loop with
aries and strings so i'm going to start
off by creating a simple array LED
colors is equal to let's say red and
then blue and then green
now if normally what we would do is we
would use for loop and say let index and
colors then we would say log colors of
index so let's save this so we have red
blue and green
but now let's have a look at the far off
statement so for now let color of colors
i'm going to log color so let's save
this there you go red blue green red
blue green so with the help of far-off
loop we can read the element directly
with lesser code so you don't have to
have an index and then use the index on
the colors array each time we get a
value from this colors array store it
into color by using the for off loop and
then we can just log it onto the console
so that's how you work with arrays using
for off loops now let's consider a
string let letters is equal to ABC then
we can do a far-off loop so let letter
of letters and we can log letter so when
you use for off loop on a string it is
going to pick each character at a time
and assign it to this letter so a is
going to be logged than B and then C so
let's have a look a B and C so that's
pretty much it how you use
the fall-off loop with an array and then
a string so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
