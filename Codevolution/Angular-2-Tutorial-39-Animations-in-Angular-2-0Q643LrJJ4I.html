39 and in this video we are going to
start learning about animations in
angular 2 now I'm pretty sure we all
know what animations are and why they're
used so I'm going to dive right into
explaining how animations are achieved
in angular 2 and to make things simpler
and help in understanding the concept
I'm also going to first explain to you
an example that we can all relate to
now consider a room now this room has a
light bulb and the light bulb is
connected to a switch now initially
let's say that the switch is in the off
state then the room is in total darkness
now if you toggle the switch to the on
state then there is light inside the
room now let's say that the bulb is also
a fancy one so the bulb takes one second
to slowly transition from off to on and
also from on to off so here's the
current situation initially the switch
is in the off state and that is
characterized by darkness when you
toggle the switch the state changes from
off to on and darkness slowly
transitions to light and when you toggle
the switch back to off state then light
also transitions back to darkness so the
switch is kind of like a trigger for
light or darkness now animations in
angular are very much like this example
first we need the element that we want
to animate in our example we had the
room and in angular we have an HTML
element like a div tag now we want to
States for the div element to transition
between so we have off state and an on
state now we need a way to characterize
these two states and for that we use CSS
now if the div tag is in the off state
let's just style it with background
color black and when it makes a
transition to the on state we have
background color as white and just like
how we have a switch to toggle between
the on and off state in angular we will
have a button to toggle between the two
states so let's see how to put all of
this into code now I have the basic
hello world template here I've just
replaced hello world with angular
animations and in style and Stiles dot
CSS I have created a class called
rule and this hat just has a height and
width of 200 pixels and a background
color of black so if we apply this to a
div tag over here and H 1 under H 1 I'm
going to say div and then close the div
and then add a class it's equal to room
let's save this and head over to the
browser there you go we have the element
that we want to animate now before we
can proceed with any animations we need
to import certain animation specific
functions in our component so over here
in our app component I need to import
several animation specific functions the
first one and I'm just going to add I'm
going to arrange it vertically so
trigger and then we are going to use
something called a state style
transition and animate keyframes and
finally group and let me also move this
down
all right now we might not use all of
them in this particular video but I'll
be covering all of them in the upcoming
videos now we define animations in the
component decorator so just like the
selector and template we have a new
configuration called animations so we're
here animations and here we can specify
an array of animations now each
animation mainly is going to have three
important things a trigger or name for
the animation possible States for the
animation and transition for the
animation so let's see how that looks in
code now over here in animations I'm
going to start off by specifying the
trigger keyword now this trigger is
basically kind of like giving a name to
the animation so let's call this lights
on off now this takes in a second
parameter which is going to be an area
of properties and over here first we are
going to specify the different states
for our animation so state now remember
our room had had an off state and an off
state so one of the states is off and
how did we characterize off state we
specify that the background color would
be black so background color black
now we also did mention that there were
two states though so the second state is
going to be the on state and how did we
say the aunts on state was going to be
we said that it is going to be light so
background color white alright now we
have the two states so the next thing we
need to specify are the transitions so
transition now remember we had two
transitions from off state to on state
and we want this to happen for a period
of let's say let's go with two seconds
so two seconds as a string and I'm going
to specify another end transition now
this transition is from on state to the
off state and then we're going to
specify this animate again for two
seconds alright so now we have the
animation ready and the element to be
animated also ready so we have to attach
this animation now and to attach the
animation to the div tag we use the
following syntax so we're here we are
going to use property binding so square
brackets we're going to use the add
symbol followed by the trigger name so
this right here lights on off so I'm
just going to copy it and then paste it
now this we're going to bind it to a
state of this animation so either off or
on but this is going to be a property
that we define in the component class so
I'm going to call this as rule dot state
so this room dot state is going to vary
between off and on so finally we need a
button to toggle this room state so over
here I think I'm going to place it above
the div tag let's go with button and
then let's call this toggle lights and
then close the button now we need to
have a click event on this button and
then bind it to a handler so I'm going
to call this toggle light so we have a
button when it gets clicked it's going
to go to the star lights function so
we're here under need title which says
angular animations I'm also going to
have rule dot state and this is going to
be of type string and initially we want
this to be off
room dot state is going to give room
implicitly has any type alright alright
I'm just going to call this room state
alright that should be fine so room
state and then room state is of type
string and initial value is going to be
off and we also need to define toggle
lights so toggle lights and we are going
to say this dot room state now we are
going to check if this dot room state is
equal to off now if it is off then we
are going to change it to on and let me
see if you can have a look at that and
if it is on we're going to change this
to off alright now we are ready to test
our application so let's save this head
over to the browser I have this toggle
lights button here if I click on this it
takes once again and then there is light
in the room if I click on this again
then it transition transitions back to
darkness so if you can consider our
example that we started with this is
like a rule
initially with off state and there is
total darkness when I switch it on it
goes to total or the light is on and it
takes one second to transition I toggle
again takes one second back to darkness
so let's quickly have a look at the code
and see how that is happening so it all
starts with the button click that the
button click is going to trigger the
star lights method and toggle its method
we are checking if room state is off or
on and we are just basically toggling
between off and on initially room state
is off so over here it comes to div tag
so the room state is off and then this
state is going to be background color so
that is going to be rendered on to the
view when I click on the button it
checks is it off yes it is
off so I'm going to change it to on now
when this rule state changes to on this
trigger is going to match the on state
and then the on state is characterized
by background color white so it knows
that it has to change to white but it
has a look at the transition so okay we
have a transition when I change from off
to on I need that to happen over a
period of two seconds and that is how it
is going to animate and when I change or
when I click on toggle lights again room
state changes from on back to off and
off is going to be checked over here we
have a state called off so we need to
now have a new cell which is background
color black but this has to happen over
two seconds so that is how animations
are going to happen in angular 2 there's
plenty more to learn about animations in
angular so stay tuned for the upcoming
