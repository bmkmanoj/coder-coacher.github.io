to combine a few conditions to create
the documents now first let us retrieve
the document list DB dot employees don't
find dot pretty so we have set of 8
documents for 8 employees and the
employees collection now the next thing
let's try to retrieve all the employees
who are skilled in MongoDB so who I have
a skill called MongoDB so DV dot
employees dot find dot pretty now and
find we are going to specify the
parameter so our condition is their
skill should be MongoDB so skill should
be Mongo TV now let's go ahead and run
this control shift enter so we have
three documents selected we have MongoDB
MongoDB and MongoDB so suppose we want
to specify an additional condition we
want to retrieve documents of employees
who are skilled in MongoDB and have a
salary of 80,000 so to do that just put
a comma and specify the second condition
so our condition is salary and it should
be 80,000 now let's go ahead and run
this control shift enter so we have only
one document in the collection and that
is for Andrew Neil he is skilled in
MongoDB and has a salary of 80,000 now
suppose we want to use either arc an arc
condition that is they either satisfy
the first condition odds second
condition let's go ahead and see how to
do that now let's say T we don't
employees don't find
not pretty now we have to specify the
parameter C if you have to specify
either one of the two conditions then we
use dollar or recall it and then we pass
an array so comma all right so we
specify the first condition and the
second condition now let's say their
skill should we either mongodb the
conditions are either the scale should
be MongoDB or either the salary should
be hundred thousand so skill as MongoDB
or their salary should be 80 tell them
sorry a hundred thousand now let's go
ahead and run this control shift enter
now this make four documents now we have
Andrew Neil who is skilled in MongoDB we
have Chris White who is not skilled in
MongoDB but he has a salary of one
hundred thousand so the second condition
is satisfied now if the third document
MongoDB and the full document MongoDB so
this is how you specify multiple
conditions you can use and condition or
you can use them or condition now we can
also combine and on our ticket and are
together let's see how to do that DB dot
employees dot find dot pretty pretty and
we have to specify the condition now we
are going to say either skill is MongoDB
then the scale should be MongoDB
and their salary can be either 80,000 or
85,000 so R :
so salary is any talent or their salary
is 85,000 so what this query is going to
say is right Ricci the list of employees
the documents of employees who are
skilled in MongoDB and their salaries
either 80,000 or 85,000 so let's have a
look we have Andrew Neil who was skilled
in MongoDB and he has a value of 80,000
and we have Felicia Felicia who has
skill MongoDB and has salary of 85,000
so no one else matches the criteria
let's go ahead and exceed the query
control shift enter and we have two
documents selected the first one is
Andrew Neil the second one is Felicia so
this is how we combine multiple
conditions to retrieve documents thank

next video goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
