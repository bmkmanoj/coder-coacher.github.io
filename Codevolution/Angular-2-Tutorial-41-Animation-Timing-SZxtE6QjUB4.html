to talk a bit about animation timing now
there are three timing properties which
you can specify for every animation that
has a transition the duration the delay
and the easing function now all these
three properties are combined and
specified as a string single string so
let's have a look at them one by one the
first one is the duration now this
duration is nothing but the duration of
the transition and it can be specified
either in seconds or milliseconds so in
our example we can specify the
transition duration to be 2 seconds or
2000 milliseconds so when I save this
head over to our browser wait for it to
reload now if I click on toggle light is
going to rotate for 2 seconds
now the second property that we have is
the delay now the delay specifies the
amount of time between the animation
trigger for example when you click a
button and then the beginning of the
transition and again the delay is
specified right after the duration in
either milliseconds or seconds so over
here after 2000 milliseconds I can
specify delay so I'm going to specify in
seconds so 3 seconds so what happens now
is once I click on this toggle lights
button there is going to be a delay of 3
seconds and then for a period of 2
seconds the rotation is going to occur
so I'm going to click 1 2 3 rotate for 2
seconds so it is possible to induce
delays in your transitions now the third
property that we have is the easing
function now the easing function
basically dictates how the animation is
going to accelerate or decelerate now
for a full list of easing functions you
can visit using.net but I'll just
demonstrate two of them in our example
now the first one is is in so is in and
the second one we are going to specify
is ease out now what is n does is it is
going to start off slowly and pick up
speed as time progresses and in with
ease out function the animation is going
to start off fast but slows down as time
progresses so is in a slow to fast is
out is fast to slow and you can you can
also notice that I have not specified
the delay here so the delay is not
mandatory if you don't specify your
second part of the string is going to be
the easing function so let's save this
and head over to our browser so when I
click on toggle lights it is going to
all right there as a problem is in is
out oh sorry there was a delay of three
seconds I forgot about that I'm just
going to reload this so I'm going to
click on toggle lights one two three
then rotate slow and then it picks up
speed and then if I click on toggle
lights again and it's going to start off
fast and then go slow so I hope you
notice that you can try it out with your
own animations and find out the
different combinations of duration delay
and easy functions that can you know
spin up a good animation but yeah this
is the basic of animation timing so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
to subscribe and I'll see you all in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
