how to delete document from a collection
now again I created a new file called
delete dot PHP and I've copied the basic
four lines of code that answers that
ends up with selecting the employee
collection so now to delete documents we
again have two methods delete one to
delete a single document and delete many
to delete multiple documents so let's
see with an example how the two methods
work so we're going to have a result
variable again to have two caps the
result of the operation so dollar delete
result is equal to we are going to be
working with the employee collection
again and the method on employee
collection is delete one and this is
going to delete a single document we
need to specify the criteria so let's go
back to our find dot PHP and let's see
what do we want to delete okay let's say
we have this ID 4 which says favorite
color blue there's just random document
in the collection so let's go ahead and
delete the document whose ID is 4 so
we're going to specify a mask or ID and
there's going to be 4 now we can use
printf or here and we can say deleted %
HD document and we can use the dollar
delete result this time and then get
deleted
the 10th count so this is going to give
us the list of documents or sorry the
count of the documents that were deleted
so let's save this let's go back change
sort to delete dot PHP
it says deleted one document let's
refresh this and there you go we have
the two Eaton's Andrew Brad and Chris we
don't have what was supposed to be
Debbie with ID 4 anymore so that's how
you delete a single document now we can
also delete multiple
so let's go ahead and come in this
however I'm going to copy it to copy
this and change delete one to delete
many and let's say okay let's we incur
incorrectly inserted eaten so goodbye
eaten so our condition is going to be
main eaten and everything else is going
to remain the same now let's save this
and refresh it deleted two documents and
there we go Tipton is no more we just
have Andrew Brad and Chris
so let's pretty much it about deleting
documents we have the delete one and
delete many so I think that's a wrap for
this tutorial series if you guys are
interested in a particular topic let me
know comment leave a comment and I'll
try to make a tutorial series or a
tutorial video based on that so anyway
