talk about the shell module in electron
now the shell module is used to open a
folder or a file within a folder or an
external URL in your default browser it
is pretty straightforward to use so
let's take a look at the demo again I'm
going to start off with the hello world
project in package.json
have changed the name to shell demo and
index of HTML I've just changed the
title and the h1 tag now the first thing
I'm going to do is in index dot HTML I'm
going to create a new button the text is
going to be open and let's give it an ID
ID is equal to open button next we are
going to have a script tag and within
the script tag we are going to require
index Dargis so let's also create this
file index dot chairs with an index
digest first let's get a reference to
the button so const open button is equal
to document dot get element by ID open
button now to work with the shell module
in electron we need to require it so
const shell is equal to require electron
dot shell and then we handle the click
event on the button so open button dot
add event listener now the event is a
click event and then we execute a
function okay so there are three useful
methods that the shell module provides
the first method that it provides is to
open a folder in your filesystem and you
specify the full path as the argument so
it is going to be shell dot show item in
folder and then the
now in my file system in Eid right I
have a folder created called electron
folder and I have demo dot txt and
YouTube logo jpg to files within this
folder so the first one we are going to
specify the path ie Drive now make sure
you escape your backslashes electron
folder demo dot txt so now let me run
NPM start and we can verify what happens
so we have the heading shell module and
we also have the button that says open
now to make sure that it is actually
working I'm going to close this file
explorer and then I'm going to click on
the Open button now what the method does
is it opens the electron folder and
selects demo dot txt
of course if demo dot exe doesn't exist
in the folder no file will be selected
so we are basically asking it to show
the item in a particular folder so show
demo dot txt in electron folder and that
is white electron folder was opened and
demo dot txt was selected by default now
the second method the shell provides is
to open the file itself so I have an
image YouTube logo dot jpg which we can
directly open from our electron
application so this is going to be shell
dot open item and then the full tab so E
electron folder YouTube logo dot jpg
let's run this and test it out again I'm
just going to close this file explorer
we start our application NPM start and
when I click on open two things must
happen the electron folder must be
opened with demo dot txt selected and
the image should be opened so I'm gonna
click on open and there you go you can
see that the electron folder was opened
and demo dot txt is selected and the
image which is our YouTube no go is
opened as well and finally the third
method is to open an
turn a link in your default browser so
we can have shell dot open external and
then the link and let's just open the
electron website so let me restart this
application and p.m. start and when I
click on the Open button three things
are going to happen so open so the first
thing was the electron folder was opened
with demo dot exe selected our YouTube
logo image was opened and in my default
browser which is chrome electron web
page is opened so that is about the
shell module in electron it can be used
to access native elements like files
folders and open links in your default
browser thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
