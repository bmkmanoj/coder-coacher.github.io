javascript we had just one type of
collection which was represented by the
area type so for mapping values the best
we could do was kind of abuse objects
but even then the mapping was restricted
from a string type to arbitrary values
so in this video that is first
understand what are maps and what are
set what was being done before es2015
to implement maps and sets and what were
the pitfalls and in the next couple of
videos we will have a closer look at
maps and sets in es 2015 so first up set
now a set is nothing but a list of
values but this list cannot contain any
duplicates and unlike arrays where we
access the individual elements in sets
we just check if a value is present or
not we don't really access the value so
the implementation in es5 would be
something like this we would have let my
set is equal to object dot create and we
would pass now so as to not inherit any
properties then we could have a property
with my set called ID and let's set this
to true so to check if ID exists or not
we would say my said dot ID and then
walk to the console ID exists now let's
save this and when we check the console
it says ID exists
great now let's change true to 1 and
save this and ID exists but now let's
change this to 0 and see what happens
I didn't exist anymore so are we
actually checking to see if a value
exists or are we checking to see if the
value is nonzero so this was very
confusing in es5 next let's have a look
at maps a map is nothing more than a
collection of key value pairs
so with es5 to have key value pairs we
will do we will do something like this
that my map is equal to object dot
create no and then we would say my map
dot name is equal to let's say Chandler
excuse me so name would act as the key
and Chandler as the value so let Val
equals my map dot name to retrieve the
value and then we can just lock to the
console Val so when we save this there
we go Chandler
but unlike sets where we were just
checking if a value exists or not
with maps we actually want to retrieve
the value so consider this example my
map of 100 is equal to hello now when I
try to log this onto the console I would
have to say my map off as a string 100
why because object properties can only
be strings so when you pass a number it
gets us to a string so when you save
this and refresh there you go
hello so the number hundred and the
string hundred both refer to the same
property and this can be a huge problem
if you want to use both the number and
the string as key now let's take a look
at objects so let Y let's create two new
objects let or we want equals this and
let a week two equals this now when we
try to create that or use that as a key
we would have my map off will be one and
let's assign a value world now ignore
the red squiggly for now because it
still works and typescript throws it at
an error so my map of obi-wan is equal
to world
when we tried to the lock when we log to
the console my map off will be one let's
save this
we have world now let me change obi-wan
to OB too and save this
we still have world and we did not set
or use or with you as the key but it
still refers to this world why because
the string representation of obi-wan and
Obi two are the same so if you try to
console dot log will be 1.2 string and
log could be 2.2 your string and save
this so the string rapid representation
is the same object object and therefore
the value you use to with key Obi one is
the same value with key or b2 so as you
can see we were solely missing a data
structure for mapping values so let's
have a closer look at sets and maps in
the next few videos thank you guys for
