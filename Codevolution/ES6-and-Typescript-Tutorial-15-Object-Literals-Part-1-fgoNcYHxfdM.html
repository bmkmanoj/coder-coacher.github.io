look at some of the features es2015
offers when we are working with objects
now consider two variables let first
name is equal to let's say Chandler and
let last name is equal to pink now let's
say we want to create a new person
object with these two values so what we
would normally do is that person is
going to be an object and we want the
values that we have just assigned so
we're going to create a property first
name and this is going to be first name
and then we are going to have a property
last name and this is going to be
assigned with the value last name so we
can log out the values now console dot
log person dot first-name and then log
person dot last name so let's save this
and go to our browser and we have
Chandler and Bing so that's what we
would usually do when we want to assign
values to the properties we would assign
it with : and then logged out now this
right here the curly braces with the
properties is called as an object
literal and es2015
provides shorthand notations and we have
object literals now the first one as
when the property name is the same as
the variable name then we can reduce
this to just first name and this to just
last name so now what yes with 2015 does
is okay you've just given me first name
and last name so away I'm going to
assume that the person object is going
to have a property first name and last
name and I'm going to assign these
values to those properties so let's save
this let's see if our code still works
and Chandler and Bing if I change this
to bings let's save this
turn their wings so it's it's working
pretty good also we can do the same when
we are returning from a function so let
me comment this out and create a new
function so function this is going to
say create a person so function create
person is going to accept first name
last name and it is going to provide us
with polling first name plus last name
and then we can return all the three so
return first name last name and also the
following so let's save this and let's
create a new object with this function
so let P is equal to create person let's
created with Ross and gellar
now we can log to the console P dot
first name log to the console P dot last
name and log to the console even P dot
full name so let's save this and there
you go Ross is the first name Keller is
the second name or last name and then
Ross killer is the full name so even
when working with functions we can
return first name last name and full
name without using the colon and
assignment so first name colon first
name last name colon last name full name
colon full name that is not needed
anymore we have the shorthand notation
and another shorthand notation is when
we are adding a method to our object so
over here
create person let's pass another
parameter age and let's break this down
it's going to return first name last
name and also fully now let's create
another property this is going to be is
singer so this is going to determine
what this function is going to determine
if the person is a senior citizen or not
and let's say if he is greater than the
age of 60 he or she is a senior citizen
and if not they are not a senior citizen
so generally this is the syntax we would
use to declare a function probably so a
senior and then we would use a colon and
then the keyword function and then
parentheses with curly braces and we
will do something like return age
greater than 60 so age is greater than
60 a senior is going to be true if not
it's going to be false so we're here
let's pass an age let's go to 32 and
let's also log that age or the CES
senior property so P dot is senior now
let's give this let's save this so we
have Ross Geller a scholar is he a
senior citizen no false because his age
is 32 now the shorthand notation here in
es2015 is when we have a function to a
property then we can ignore this
function keyword and the colon
so e senior and then parentheses and
then we have the function body so let's
save this and see if it still works
refresh it is still false let me change
the age from 32 to 62 let's save this
there you go true so those are some of
the shorthand notations we have with
object literals the first one is with a
regular object when you assign when you
have to create properties with the same
name as that of the variable you are
sending it to then you can just have
first name
last name also when you're returning
from a function you don't need to do
that again first name last name fully
works pretty good we don't have to say
first name column first name and so on
and also we have this new shorthand
notation when having a function inside
this object literal and we can omit the
colon and the function keyword and just
have parenthesis so that's pretty much
it for this video thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
