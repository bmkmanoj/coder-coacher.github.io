to a beginner's guide on authenticating
angular applications in this
introductory video I'm going to explain
the stack we are going to work with
lists the prerequisites for the series
and show you a demo of the application
we are going to build let's get started
the choice of stack is the mean stack
it's a free and open source stack and is
a popular choice to build web
applications we will be using MongoDB
for storing data Express framework to
create restful api s-- angular as our
front-end framework and note which is
the execution environment as of this
recording angular is version 5 and is
the version we will be using
I am confident though that the
application should work with future
releases of angular as well now in order
to make the most of the series it is
essential that you have a knowledge of
some of the existing technologies HTML
CSS and JavaScript kind of go without
saying but what you really need to have
is a basic understanding of MongoDB
angular and node this course is going to
focus on how to authenticate angular
applications and not focus on the
concepts of the individual underlying
technologies you definitely don't have
to be an expert but a basic knowledge of
the main stack will really help you now
if you're unaware of some of the
technologies feel free to go through my
channel for tutorials on angular node
and MongoDB and then resume this course
alright now let's take a look at the
application we will be building it's a
pretty simple one and I call it event
hub it's an application that lists the
events which we can consider
hypothetically to be happening around
you so when you navigate to the root of
the application for our example
localhost 42-hundred you get
directed to the events page slash events
here your displayed a list of events
which can be viewed by anyone visiting
the site we also have a members tab
which has the special events that can
only be accessed if the user is
authenticated or in simpler terms logged
in so if you are not logged in and try
to click on the members tab we are
redirected to the login screen once you
login by default you're taken to the
members page so a logged in user has
access to both the regular and the
special events also you can notice that
once you log in the login and register
buttons are replaced with the logout
button when you click on logout you're
navigated away from the members tab to
the regular events tab if you're a
first-time user you can also register as
a new user in which case you would be
navigated to the members page so that's
the application we are going to build
from scratch as I mentioned this course
is a beginner's guide to put you on the
path to learning about authenticating
angular applications at the end of this
course you should be able to make use of
the knowledge to build medium or large
scale applications with authentication I
will also give you a few tips on how you
can improve the application we will be
building so that you can apply what you
learn in this course and as always the
source code is on github so to summarize
the requirements the regular events can
be viewed by any user whereas the
special events can only be viewed by the
registered members on our site or in
other terms authenticated users alright
