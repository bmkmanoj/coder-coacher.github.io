will have a look at how to pass
parameters while navigating from one
view to another and here's what we will
do in our department list component we
will display a list of departments and
if we click on the Department we should
navigate to a department detailed
component and in this department detail
component we are just going to display
the ID of the department that the user
has selected so this sounds fairly
simple let's get started with the code
now I've already added the department
list component code so what I've done is
created an array of departments it has
an ID and a name and currently I have
five departments angular node Mongo ruby
and bootstrap and in the template I use
the ng for directive to iterate over
this department array and each time I
select the department and then I display
the department ID and the department
name and I've also used a bit of styling
so I make use of a class called item and
class called badge so when I run this
application and click on departments
this is how it's going to look I'm going
to have the department list and then the
list of departments angular node Mongo
ruby and bootstrap so what we need to do
is suppose I click on angular I need to
be navigated to Department detail
component where it is going to say you
selected the department with ID is equal
to one so let's see how to do this with
code now first we are going to have to
configure our new route so in a pro team
module yes we are going to include a new
path so I'm going to have path and this
is going to be department slash ID so
this is basically a placeholder for a
parameter all right and we are going to
see how we are going to make use of this
now department ID and then the component
so component
is going to be department detail
component component yep
all right now we also need to import
this department detail component so
let's I'm just going to copy this then
paste it over here and then I'm going to
change this list to detail and then list
to detail and then we also need to
include this and the routing components
array so I'm going to put a comma and
then include this so now let's go ahead
and create this department detail
component so over here in our app folder
I'm going to add a new file this is
going to be department - detail dot
component dot TS so now we have this
component we're going to start off with
alright I think I can make use of this
employ list component as a template to
get started so we import complaint from
angular slash core and then we use the
component decorator
now instead of employee list component
we are going to call this what did we
call it let's go back to uploading
module we call this department detail
component so I'm going to paste this
over here and you know in fact we don't
even require this selector why because
we are not going to embed this component
anywhere we are going to navigate to
department detail component from the
department list component so we don't
need a selector in this case and in the
h3 tag I'm just going to say you
selected Department with ID is equal to
and then we'll fill this shortly so now
we have our department detail component
basics ready now let's go back to our
department list component and make sure
that we navigate to Department detail
component so the first thing we need to
do is handle the click event on each
department in this particular list
so when I click on a particular
department I need to go to the
department detail component so for that
we make use of event binding so over
here and I'm just going to add at the
beginning so that you can just going to
be visible to you
so click event so what happens when we
click we're going to assign it and have
assign it a handler so I'm going to say
on select and then we are also going to
pass the department now to navigate in
the code we need to make use of the
router service so let's go ahead over
here and then import what are we
importing the router service we're going
to import this from angular slash router
alright now we have imported the service
so we are going to make use of
dependency injection to get an instance
of it so over here and department list
component I'm going to have a
constructor so in the constructor I'm
going to create private router of type
router so now I basically have and I
basically have a local variable called
router that refers to an instance of
this router service so now we can define
this on select department method that is
actually going to navigate to the
department detail component so under
department alright let me scroll a bit
more now let's define on select now on
select is going to accept a department
that is nothing when the department that
the user has clicked on and once we have
the department we are going to use the
router service that we have access to
and then we are going to call the
navigate method on the router service
now this navigate method takes in what
is known as a link parameter array now
this is basically all the information
that angular needs to construct the URL
now we are going to
in two items to this to this parameters
array the first one is the destination
path so this is nothing but slash
Department if you have a look at
uploading module Department so this is
the first part of the URL the second
part is the parameter so over here I'm
going to put a comma and then what is
the parameter we are going to pass the
ID of the selected component of the
selected department so I have the
Department over here so I'm just going
to call department dot ID so whatever
the user selected and passing its ID as
a parameter so now I can save this and
let's have a look at our application to
make sure it actually passes to the
department detail component so I'm going
to click on angular and there you go the
department slash one was reflected in
the URL and we are also displaying the
department detail component so you
select ed department with ID is equal to
so we are navigating to the department
detail component and we are also
displaying the department detail
component the next step is to retrieve
this ID or the parameter from the URL
into our component and display it in the
view and for that we make use of
something known as activated route
service so in the department detail
component because this is where we need
to retrieve the ID or the parameter we
need to first import activated route
service so import activated activated
route service and this we are going to
import from again angular slash router
so again when we have a service we make
use of dependency injection to
constructor to get access to that so
constructor
and private private and I'm going to
call this route and this is an instance
of activated route so now we have the
dependency injection done and we are
going to fetch the parameter and that is
going to be done as soon as the
component is loaded so basically the on
in it lifecycle hook so I'm going to
import on in it and then this component
is going to implement on in it then if
it implements on in it we need to define
the ng on init method alright so in the
uninit method what are we going to do we
are going to retrieve the parameter so
I'm going to create a variable let ID is
a call to and we have access to the
service so this dot route and this gives
us a snapshot of the current route so
basically where are we we are in the
department's slash one URL so that
information is going to provide it by
this snapshot now this snapshot gives us
access to the parens property and in the
Panem's property what do we need we need
the ID and this ID is going to match
what we configured in a router so this
ID should match this ID so basically we
are telling from the current URL there's
a parameter called ID retrieve it and
assign it to this property called ID so
this start department ID sorry so we
have let ID is equal to the ID from the
parameter and then we are going to
create a simple department ID public
Department ID this is a variable that we
are going to display in our view so this
store department ID is equal to ID
now this department ID is going to
contain the ID that the user navigated
to so over here we can use interpolation
to bind it so department ID so now I'm
going to save this let's have a look at
our application all right so let's let's
begin from the beginning let's begin
from the initial URL localhost 3000 now
when I click on Department I get the
department list when I click on angular
I get you selected Department with ID is
equal to 1 and this one is nothing but
the one in the URL let me go back to
departments click a node you select it
with ID is equal to two Mongo 3 and 3 so
we have passed the parameter and we have
retrieved the parameter so let me go
over the code one more time so that you
get a better understanding this time how
the flow works so we start off with the
Department list component so we have the
ng 4 directive to iterate over this
departments array and then display each
department and then each department we
are going to bind with the click method
so when we click on that we are going to
call on select method passing in the
clicked Department so we're here in
unselect we are going to use navigate
method of the router service which takes
in a link parameter sorry
so first we specify the path or the
destination where we want to go to that
is nothing but departments but this time
we also want to specify a parameter so
that is nothing but department ID so
when I navigate to Department
slash ID or department ID ab dot routing
module dot es is going to figure out
that this is the path and I need to
display department detail component so
the department detail component gets
displayed and over here we need to
extract from the URL the ID of the
department the user has clicked and for
that we make use of the activated route
service this is going to give us a
snapshot of the current route and
snapshot is going to current contain all
the parameters in the URL and we just
need the ID parameter so we're going to
retrieve that and assign it to a
variable local variable called ID then
we assign that ID back to a department
ID that we have displayed in our view
using interpolation and that is how when
I click on angular you get your selected
department with ID is equal to one
alright so that is how you pass a
parameter and then retrieve that
parameter in two different components or
well navigating from one view to another
