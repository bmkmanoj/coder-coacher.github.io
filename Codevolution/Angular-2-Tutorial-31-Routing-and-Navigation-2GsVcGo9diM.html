number 31 and in this video we are going
to start learning about routing and
navigation in angular 2 now any angular
application you build is going to have
multiple components and each component
is going to probably have its own view
so we need a way to navigate from one
view to another as and when the user
performs some task and for this we make
use of angular's router now I know that
we did learn about services already but
I'm going to try a word using services
to fetch data as much as possible
because I really want to focus on
learning the concepts of routing and not
be worried about how data is going to
flow between the components and there is
a lot to learn about angular's router so
let's start with the basics so here's
the requirement for our basic routing
application we need to have an app
component or we need to have yeah we
need to have an app component and in the
app component we are just going to have
a heading called routing application and
inside the app component we are also
going to have two buttons called
departments and employees now when the
user navigates to the URL localhost 3000
slash departments or clicks on this
departments button we need to render a
department list component over here and
if the user navigates to localhost 3000
slash employees or clicks on this
employees button then we need to render
employee list component over here in the
app component so now that we have
understood the requirements let's see
how to put this into code now in our so
I have a basic application we have the
app module which is the root module of
our application we have the app
component which is the root component of
our application and we just have an h1
tag that says routing application and
then we also have the two components
that we need to display Department list
component and
just this just has an h3 tag with
Department list and then the employee
list component which just has h3 with
employee list and if I run this
application right now all we are going
to see is routing application which is
from the app component now to work with
angular routing the very first step we
need to do is set the base tag and index
dot HTML so let's go over here and an
index dot HTML I have set the first
child to this head tag as base href is
equal to forward slash now this is
required so that the application knows
how to construct the URLs while
navigating and the second step is to
actually configure the routes for our
application and for that we need the we
need router module so in AB dot module
dot es I'm going to import this new
router module so import and what are we
importing we are going to import router
module and this is going to be in a
separate package so from angular slash
router now since we imported this I'm
also going to have this and this imports
Eric and I'm going to move this into
separate lines for better readability so
over here you want to specify browser
module and the way we configure routes
is right here in the imports array this
router module has a method for route and
this for route is going to accept an
array of all the possible routes for our
application and each route is nothing
but an object and this object is going
to have a path now what is this path
this is basically what we want to
navigate to in the URL so if you have a
look over here departments is one path
and employees is another path so we are
going to configure these two routes so
if the path is departments then what is
the component that you need to render
the component is Department list
component
and I also have an extension that is
that is going to autumn port this
component so over here I have the import
statement now similarly I'm also going
to import another or I'm also going to
configure another path so the path is
employees and the component that we are
going to render is going to be Employee
List component and again it is going to
auto import that for me so let me just
cut this and paste it over here because
I want the module first and then the the
components alright so since we are
making use of these two components also
need to include this in the declarations
so over here and then over here alright
so this is the second step of our
application to configure our rods so
that is done so now if the user enters
the URL localhost 3000 slash departments
then Department list component is going
to be displayed and localhost /
localhost 3000 slash employees employee
list component is going to be displayed
but here's the thing we can't expect the
user to paste different URLs to navigate
to these different views so what we are
going to do is in our app component we
are going to include two buttons that
the user can click to navigate to the
corresponding component so over here and
the template I'm going to use backticks
so that we can have multiple lines of
HTML I'm going to use the nav tag so nav
and then I'm going to use let's see
we're going to use the anchor tag so
anchor tag and what is the text I'm just
going to say departments and then close
the anchor tag and another anchor tag
and I'm going to say employees and close
this anchor tag now whenever we declare
the router module over here we also get
access to all the directive
that angular's router support so for our
anchor tag to make routing possible we
are going to include two special
directives the first one is a router
link director now this is going to
specify the path that we want to
navigate to so when I click on
departments button
I want to navigate to the department's
path so this right here departments so
departments and similarly when I go to
the employees pad what I want when I
click on the employees button
I want to navigate to the employees path
so the throttling is going to take care
of that and the second director we are
going to add is router link active now
basically what this does is it allows us
to specify a class in our case the name
of the class is active which gets
applied to this element and good tag
when the path is departments or in
simpler terms if I click on this anchor
tag or if I click on this anchor tag
button it is going to apply a class
called active to this particular element
so let me copy paste the same for
employees copy and then paste it so now
let's save this alright so now we have
two buttons that we can navigate to the
corresponding path but where are we
going to display this department list
component or the employ list component
so for that we are going to make use of
the router outlets so this is like an
HTML tag that angular's router provides
so router outlet open and close router
outlet so the components are going to
get rendered in between these two tags
all right now we can say our application
and have a look if it works so I'm going
to go back to angular routing so we are
in localhost colon 3000 and as you see
here we have two buttons departments and
employees if I click on departments then
Department list component gets rendered
over here if I click and also if you
have a
look the path got changed or the URL got
changed to Department and now there's
also a class called active so let me
quickly show you what that class does so
I'm going to go to styles dot CSS and
let's see if I can find the active class
all right there you go inside the nav
tag for an anchor tag if there's a class
active just change the color to this
particular blue color so since we
clicked on this anchor tag the color of
this text is now blue and if I click on
employees the employee list components
gets rendered the URL changes to
employees and the class active gets
applied to this anchor tag now so pretty
simple right let's just quickly go
through the code once more and
understand the flow of how it works so
the first step we are going to set the
base href tag index dot HTML to make it
possible for angular router to do its
URL construction the second step we are
going to import router module and then
we use for route and then configure the
different pads so the path is
departments and employees so with just
these I can navigate to without the
button click if I navigate to
departments it is going to go to
departments and then department list is
going to get rendered so basically we
are specifying if you enter departments
in the URL show the department list
component if I enter employees in the
component or in the URL employee list
component gets to be displayed but we
also the user is then we are going to
enter the URL explicitly so we are going
to provide two buttons two anchor tags
the anchor tags have directives Roger
link and the Roger link takes in the
path so when I click on this button it
checks the Roger link directive oh I
need to use the department's route so
departments route okay I found it what
is the component I need to show
department list component so when I
click on this particular button
department list component gets rendered
and
the active class gets applied to this
particular button and then if I click on
the employees button it's going to check
for employees path and the cut in the
configured routes it finds this pad and
then chill and then displays the
Employee List component so that is how a
simple or basic routing application is
going to work all right thank you guys
