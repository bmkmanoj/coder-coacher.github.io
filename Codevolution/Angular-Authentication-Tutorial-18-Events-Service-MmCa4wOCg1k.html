of our application and since events API
is a get request I'm going to start with
the services and finish off with the UI
all right events is not connected with
authentication so we are going to create
a separate service to deal with fetching
the list of regular and special events
and we are not going to be using the odd
service so the first step is to generate
a new service called event service so in
the terminal navigate to the ng app
folder and then run the command ng g for
generate s for service and then the name
of the service which is event next let's
add the service in the providers array
in AB dot module dot TS so in the
providers array I'm going to type event
service and this is also going to
automatically import event service for
us next step let's make an HTTP call to
the backend API to fetch the events data
so open event service and over here
first import HTTP client and then
injected import and then inject next we
are going to create the properties that
point to the backend API so we are going
to have private underscore events URL
which points to localhost colon 3000
slash API slash events and private
underscore special events URL which
points to localhost colon 3000 slash API
slash special finally let's define the
methods to make the HTTP GET requests so
the first method is going to be get
events and within the body we are going
to return this dot HTTP dot get off type
any and the argument is the URL this dot
underscore events URL similarly the
second method get
special events and then within the body
returned this dot HTTP dot get of type
any and then the argument is going to be
this dot underscore special events URL
so get events returns the array of
regular events and get special events
returns the array of special events keep
in mind they do return the data as an
observable so we need to subscribe to
them in the components so first open
events dot component dot TS now over
here first I'm going to import the event
service and then injected import and
inject next create a new property to
store the list of events returned by the
service so events is equal to an empty
array
now let's subscribe to the observable in
the on in it lifecycle hook so over here
in ng on in it we're going to type this
dot underscore event service dot get
events next let's subscribe to this and
when we get the response we are going to
assign it to events so this dot events
is equal to response if we do get an
error however we are just going to knock
that to the console alright let's do the
exact same thing in the special events
component first import event service and
then injected next let's create a
property called
special events and this is going to be
an empty array and then in ng on in it
we are going to fetch the list of
special events so this dot underscore
event service dot get special events we
subscribe to this when we get a response
we are going to assign this dot special
events is equal to response if you do
get an error we're just going to log
that to the console and that's pretty
much it we created a service to fetch
regular and special events and subscribe
to the observables and the respective
components in the next video let's
develop the UI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
