tutorial series on no GS my name is Wes
Ross and in this video series we're
going to be focusing on learning nodes
yes I'm pretty sure you guys are aware
of the increasing popularity of new GS
so let's first understand what is no GS
and why is it used
so no GS is a runtime environment for
creating web applications on the server
side and what I mean by that is it
allows us to run JavaScript on the
backend outside a browser the node.js is
also a library because it comes with a
lot of built-in modules that saves us a
time by not having to code everything
from scratch why do we use it now we
have already been using javascript for
front-end development and by using
javascript foot back and as well we are
going to be reducing the complexity of
building our application and node.js is
extremely fast because it runs on the
Google v8 engine and because this
asynchronous event event model we can
create games chat rooms where multiple
users chat simultaneously with a lot of
ease now before you can learn how to
start using node.js we we first need to
download and install it so go to google
and type node.js and click on the first
link or you can just go to HTTP nodejs
0rg and once you're here click on the
version 4.2 point for which we are going
to be making use in this tutorial series
and once you download it go ahead and
install it now i've already downloaded
it and install it i promise you that the
installation is very simple you just
need to click next' all the way and then
a finish at the end and once you are
done installing open command prompt and
type node - me and it it says version
4.2 point 4 which is the node.js version
we have installed in our machine ok now
that we have downloaded it and install
it in
let's create a very fast node.js
application it's going to be pretty
simple let's just print out hello world
to our console okay so open a text
editor of your choice I'm going to be
making use of sublime text you can
either use notepad or sublime text or
whichever you're comfortable with to
create a new file and save it as alright
let's go to desktop in a node.js folder
let's create hello whoa Jess and type
console dot log hello
no hello hello oh wow okay hello Walt
now save your file and go to the desktop
no J's folder right-click holding shift
open command window here now to run a
node.js application you have to type
node followed by the file name so node
and hello world oh wow hello
wall dodged as let say this hello world
in our console pretty basic stuff right
but that does it for interaction video
and the coming videos we are going and
we are going to dive a bit deeper into
nature's understanding a lot of
different concepts then use all these
concepts to build a simple node.js
application anyway thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
