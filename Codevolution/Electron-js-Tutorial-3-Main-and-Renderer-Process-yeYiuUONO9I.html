are going to learn about the main
process and the render process in
electron now I have created a new folder
called main renderer and this is the
exact same content as the hello world
application I just have made a few
changes I've changed the project name to
main renderer and index dot HTML has
changed the title to main renderer app
and also the heading tags to main
renderer and we are going to start off
by adding the missing web technologies
namely CSS and JavaScript to this
application so over here we have the
HTML file let's add the CSS files and
also the JavaScript file create a new
file and name this style start yourself
over here I'm just going to add the
color property for the h1 tag I'm going
to make it orange color and back in the
HTML file we need to reference that CSS
so add link stylesheet we don't need the
type and Atrus is size dot PSL similarly
create a new file and name it index
digest which is going to be a JavaScript
file within this file I'm just going to
log to the console so console dot log
from index dot gel similarly in the main
dot J's files I'm going to lock to the
console from main Dodgers now in our
index dot HTML files we need to make a
reference to this index ES file and the
way we do that is kind of no Jo syntax
so we do have the script tag but now
instead of the source attribute we are
going to use require and then subscribe
the file name in the current folder we
have a file called index J and this has
to be imported over here
so now let's save this and run our
application so I'm going to open the
integrated terminals view integrated
terminal and then I'm going to run NPM
start so if you have a look our h1 tag
is now in orange
color so our CSS is working let's verify
if the JavaScript is working so if you
have a look at the terminal we can only
see from Maine gorgeous is logged but
what about from index dot yes
well if you have a look at the consoles
in the developer tools in the browser
window here is where you will see index
or GS is logged right so with this
background let's understand what is the
main process and a renderer process in
electron if the process which runs the
main script in package the JSON is
called the main process so in our case
the process running main dodgiest is the
main process and the main process is
responsible for creating this graphical
user interface by creating web pages
using the browser window this one now
each of these web pages for example each
of these windows have their own process
known as the render process and the
renderer process are isolated from each
other
so if there are multiple browser windows
the renderer processes from each of them
do not conflict this is to make use of
chromium multi-process architecture so
basically what I want you to keep in
mind it's pretty simple in an electronic
application there is going to be a main
process and one or more renderer
properties the main process creates the
web pages for the UI each web page has
its own render process that doesn't
interfere with any other vendors process
so when we console logs in main dodge
yes it is
the main process and we console login
index yes it is from the render process
so let's quickly put together the HTML
and JavaScript files and see a demo now
in the main dot J's file we are going to
declare two windows so let with one and
win two in our function
create window let's create two windows
so win one and then similarly we are
going to have win two next we are going
to load the HTML file to each of these
two browser windows so window 1 let's
load index dot HTML in fact let's rename
this to 1 dot HTML and also main index
dot HTML to 1 dot HTML similarly I'm
going to copy paste so that we have
loaded two dot HTML - window - and I'm
going to create a new file - dot HTML
and I'm going to copy paste the content
from one dot HTML so copy this and into
dot HTML paste it and what I'm going to
do is rename the heading so this is
render one
and similarly this is render it to all
right let's go back to our main jazz now
and open developer tools on both window
1 and window - so window one and then
window too
next we need to handle the closed event
on both the windows so this is going to
be window one dot on closed and
similarly window two dot on closed all
right now we have two HTML files so
let's create two JavaScript files one
for each of the HTML files I'm going to
rename index Dodgers as one dot yes so
one dot J and over here I'm going to say
from render process one
so from render one and similarly I'm
going to create 2 GS and I'm going to
add from renderer to now in one dot HTML
we are going to require 1.0 and
similarly in to dot HTML we are going to
require 2 GS
so let's run this application now and
verify so I'm going to run command NPM
start again and this is going to put the
renderer to browser window on top so I'm
going to put this side-by-side and if
you have a look we have renderer 1 which
is from render process 1 and then render
it to over here which is from render
process to if you have a look at the
console it says clump render 1 and over
here from renderer 2 and again if you
have a look at the integrated terminal
we get main Dodgers so we have the main
process which runs main Dodgers now this
main Dodgers can create multiple browser
windows each having its own render
process so that is why it can create two
browser windows render one in the
renderer two and each of these renderer
processes do not interfere with each
other so that is why even though I have
console dot log from renderer one it
doesn't get logged here in the same from
renderer to get doesn't get logged in
the first browser window so the bottom
line is a main process creates multiple
rendered processes
and each renderer process doesn't
interfere with the other renderer
properties and what's great about the
browser window is that it can be created
from a render process as well so right
now we are creating our browser windows
from the main process so when within
main dot yes we have this create window
that creates new browser windows but we
can also create a browser window from a
renderer process so the main process
creates a browser window for the UI and
the browser window can in turn create
more browser windows and each time a new
separate renderer process will be
created for that particular browser
window let's take a look at an example
let's create a new HTML file and name
this three dot HTML and similarly I'm
going to create another file called
three dots Cheers this is the JavaScript
file
now within features I'm just going to
log to the console render process 3 and
I'm just going to copy paste the
contents of one dot HTML to 3 dot HTML
and make the changes this will be when
there are three this will be three
Dodgers so we are going to load this 3
dot HTML which has three Dodgers being
called now we need to be able to create
a new window from the existing browser
window so in 1 dot HTML let's add a new
button and give it an ID so button ID is
equal to let's call this new window
button then I'm just going to give the
text as create now what we need to do is
listen to the click event on this button
and create a new browser window and we
do that in one dot chair this right here
so in one Jess first we need to get
ahold of the browser window so browser
window and then we are going to require
from electron but this time because we
are making use of another browser window
we need to use
remote dot browser window then of course
we are going to make use of path is
equal to require path the path built-in
module and similarly the URL built-in
module so require URL next we need to
get hold of the button that we just
created in our HTML it's a new window
button this will be equal to document
dot get element by ID new window button
and then you ring the button dot add
event listener and we are going to
listen to the click event so click and
then we are going to excuse the function
this is going to give us the event and
what we are going to do here is create a
new browser window
so let's win three is equal to new
browser window and then we are going to
load three dot HTML into this browser
window so I'm just going to copy paste
the same code so we have load URL let's
just make a couple of changes window
three has to replace window one and one
not HTML it has to be replaced by three
dot HTML and then let's just open the
developer tools as well so this will be
window 3 dot web content dot F in dev
tools
alright let's start this application and
see how it works so ctrl C to cancel the
current process and then NPM start to
create this process again all right so
we have render one and then render it to
so we have the main process that creates
two new browser windows on the left hand
side the first render process on the
right hand side the second one later
process and you can see here here in the
console it says render one and then when
there are two now from our browser
window we can create a new browser
window and for that we have added this
create button and when I click on this
create button you see that a new browser
window is created and this says when the
three and in the console renderer three
so we have one browser window creating
another browser window and what's
important to know here is that they both
have their own render process fees so
even though we created render tree from
renderer one this particular console dot
log is not logged over here so we don't
see vendor one over here in renderer
three and vice versa we don't see a
render three cheers in renderer one now
the concepts of main process and render
process is pretty important especially
when it comes to communication between
the GUI and the file system and we will
learn more about IPC or inter process
communication later on but for now just
remember that there is one main process
and one or more isolated when there are
processes alright thank you guys for
