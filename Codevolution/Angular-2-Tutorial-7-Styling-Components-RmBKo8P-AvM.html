have seen the selector which is nothing
but sort of a custom HTML tag that we
are going to use to represent this
component we will also come across this
template which is nothing but our HTML
code now in this video let us learn how
to style this HTML code for a component
the funny thing now I need to mention
that so far I have this href as Styles
dot CSS instead of style dot CSS which
is the actual file name now I corrected
it and hence you might see a different
format of hello world and German
tutorials excuse me
okay so ma'am that is clear let's go
back to our tutorials component now
let's say we create let's let me change
it to backticks so we can have multiple
lines and let's create another line of
HTML so let's create an h4 tag close it
h4 and we can have it as Heather for
from tutorials component alright so
let's see how to style this h4 tag or
just apply any style in general now for
that we are going to be using something
called as style configuration so you
specify the keyword Styles followed by
an array of styles so again let's have
backticks followed by H 4 which is going
to be let's say color red now when you
save this and let's see there you go we
have header for from tutorials component
in red color so what we have done is
created a new metadata or configuration
called styles and we have specified a
color red for this h4 tag
now what you need to keep in mind is
that styles are confined to a component
so if we have multiple components then
if we have styles for each component
then that style is restricted to that
particular component let me show you
with an example what I mean let's go
back to your app component and create a
selector I mean sorry let's create a
metadata or configuration which is
styled and this is going to have an H
for backticks sorry backticks and then
the H for again let's have the color
which is going to be blue and within our
template let's create our h4 tag h4
close h4 let's say header for from app
component now let's go to our style dot
CSS and here let's create h4 and color
orange and within our index dot HTML
let's create a new tag h4 close the h4
and let's have it as Heather for from
index so what we're basically done is
created some text header for from each
of the components the app complement we
have created a header from the tutorials
complement we are created a header and
our main index out HTML you have created
a header for now when we save all this
and go to our browser we see that the
header for from index is an orange color
which piece which we specified in our
style dot CSS HR color orange we have
our header for from add component in
blue
so if we go to your app component your
specified each four bit color blue and
finally we have had a fall from
tutorials component in red color if we
go to your tutorials component we are
specified red so the main focus the main
thing to take away is that styles are
restricted to a component they do not
lead out to the HTML file or the style
from the HTML file does not get in to
the component so that's pretty much it
about Styles so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
