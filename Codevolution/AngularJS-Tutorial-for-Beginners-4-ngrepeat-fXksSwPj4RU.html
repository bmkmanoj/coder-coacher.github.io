an array called numbers which has been
initialized with the values 0 through 9
using the entry in a directive as shown
so we have an array called numbers and
it has the values 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
now let us see how to display each of
these numbers in our HTML page under the
script tag we will be creating creating
a new paragraph tag and we can type out
the number is now we can use an
expression and type numbers of 0 to type
the very first number in the array so
when you go ahead and save it reload it
it says number is 0 now if you want to
display the second element and the array
just copy it paste it and change 0 to 1
go ahead and save it reload it number is
0 number is 1 if you want to display the
next element in the array
go ahead copy/paste it change it to 2
and save it and reload it so we have
number 0
number 1 number 2 now this obviously is
not the most efficient way to display
numbers or items in an array now to
eliminate this redundancy angular
provides another directive called
ng-repeat now as the name suggests
ng-repeat is going to repeat HTML
elements once for each item in a
collection or in our case arrays let us
see how to use the ng-repeat director
now remove this redundant code create a
new paragraph tag and then type and she
repeat
is equal to we can type number and sorry
yeah number and numbers and what do we
want to do for every number in our
numbers array we want to go ahead and
print out number is number right might
be a bit confusing let me explain it so
ng-repeat is going to iterate through
every element in our array called
numbers and store it and a variable
called number now this number is going
to be used by the expression to display
the value and the HTML page now when you
go ahead and save it go to browser
reload it so it says number is 0 number
is 1 and all the way till number is 9 so
that's how you use ng-repeat directive
to iterate through items in the
collection thank you for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
