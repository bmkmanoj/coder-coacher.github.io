number eleven now one of the most common
areas of error in JavaScript is the use
of this keyword inside functions now I
know it's always a tough task to explain
anything related to this keyword but I'm
going to try my best not to confuse you
with this one so let's start off with an
example let's have a variable employee
who is going to be an object so and
let's have a property there's going to
be ID 1 and let's have a function
probably so greet function and let's
console console dot console yeah console
dot log this dot ID now let's go ahead
and call this employee dot greet so our
expected output the start ID should be
ID 1 so in our console 1 and that's what
we get so far so good
now let's say we want to display this
console dot log or this start ID after
one second so let's wrap this inside a
set timer function set timeout now set
timer is going to take first parameter
as function and second parameter is a
time so we want thousand seconds
thousand milliseconds are one second and
let's go ahead and paste this inside the
curly braces so all you have done right
now is move this console dot log within
a set time what function so that it is
called after one second let's save this
and see what console is it says
undefined and why is that so when you
have a function it is going to create
its own context for this keyword so this
keyword right here is bound to this
function over here
it does not have the context of the
outer function so this does not have any
value within this function and hence is
undefined now to have a workaround we
would have something like variable self
is equal to this or variable that is
equal to this and then replace this with
self and save this and you get the value
one so by creating another variable we
are saving the context of this keyword
from within this function and we you and
we are using that context over here
within the second function and that's
how we were working so far in JavaScript
but now with our functions there is an
easier way you just have to replace a
regular function with error function and
you're going to get the desired behavior
so I'm going to replace function with
error function and we can go ahead and
remove this and replace self with this
so let me save this refresh and one so
how does this work now whenever you use
an error function it is not going to
create its own this so this is going to
be referring to its parent this or in
fact this dot ID will be from here and
not its own value so whenever you want
to use the this keyword from the
execution context make use of add
functions but if you really do want
separate this for the function itself
then do not use error function use a
regular JavaScript function so to
summarize about other functions we have
two benefits the first one is we are
reducing the amount of code that we
write and the second one is we are
solving the problem that is cost by
using this keyword inside a function so
that's pretty much it for this video
thank you guys for watching and don't
really subscribe I'll see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
