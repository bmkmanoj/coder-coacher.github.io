UI for the registration component again
this is pretty much going to be
bootstrap so I'm not going to explain
what each class I applied us but just
mention the elements that make up the
registration component so in the
register folder open register dot
component dot HTML now we start off with
a div tag with class role and within the
row a div tag that spans six columns so
div call MD six and we use a mix - auto
class to center the div tag horizontally
so margin on the x-axis set to auto then
for the form we are going to use cards
so a div tag with a class card and
rounded zero this card is going to have
a header and a body so create a div tag
with a class card header
and this contains an h3 tag with
margin-bottom
set to zero that says register
the curve also has a body so DIF with a
car body class within the body we have
the actual form tag now the form tag has
a class form we don't really need the
action attribute so I'm going to remove
this and within the form tag you're
going to have to form groups so div tag
with form group the first form group is
for the email address so add a label
email and an input tag with class form
control and rounded 0 let's also make
this a required field similarly add the
second form group so div form group and
this is for the password at a label that
says password and an input element that
is required as well so input type is
equal to text the same class and it is
also a required field and before closing
the form tag let's also add the button
to register the user so a button tag
with a class button but in primary and
let's also float this to the right so
float:right and then the text is going
to be register let's also add type is
equal to button now let's save this and
take a look at the browser so go back to
Chrome and there you go
looks pretty good to me except for the
spacing at the top so I'm gonna add some
padding to the top of the div tag so row
and then padding top five so let's save
this go back to the browser and you can
see that it's much better alright
finally let's add a click handler that
calls an event register user when this
register button is clicked so we need to
retrieve the value from the input field
it's email and password and send it to
the back end but for now let's simply
try to log these values to the console
so we are going to have to use two-way
data binding with the ngmodel directive
and for two-way binding we need the
forms module so go to app module and
import the forms module so right over
here I'm going to paste the import
statement and then add it to the imports
array so after browser module we're also
going to have the forms module next in
the register component type script file
we're going to add a new property this
is going to be registered user data and
let's set it to an empty object now we
bind the input to this register user
data property so in the HTML file we are
going to add the ng model directive so
for each input tag I'm going to add the
banana in a box model so square brackets
and then parentheses and then ng model
this is going to be equal to register
user data dot email and then we of
course have to set the name attribute
this is going to be email similarly for
the second input tag we also need to
have an NG model directive so I'm going
to copy this paste it and change email
to password and then the name to
password so register user data is the
object that contains the email and
password values of the user about to be
registered let's log to the console on
the click of register button let's add a
click handler so within parentheses
click that called same event register
user when the user clicks on the
register button let's go back to the
typescript file and define this register
user method
register user and this is just going to
log to the console this dot register
user data all right now if I go back to
the browser navigate to the register
component open the console fill in the
details email is going to be a at a.com
with the password a and I click on
register you can see the object log in
the console register user data it's an
object that has an email and a password
so we are able to retrieve the user
object which has to be submitted to the
backend
now before we wind up I noticed a
mistake this is a password field so
let's change input type is equal to text
to input type is equal to password save
this go back to the browser let it
refresh a SD password is a SD much
better so if I click on register we
should have the register user data
object log in the console alright now
that we have the UI next let us create
the registration service that calls the
backend registration API</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
