42 and in this video we will quickly
learn about animation callbacks
now angular is going to fire events one
at the beginning of the animation and
one at the end of the animation so it is
possible to listen to these events by
assigning an event handler and get some
information about the animation so let's
have a look at the code over here in our
div tag where we have the trigger for
our animation we can bind or we can do
even twining so we are going to use the
trigger name or sorry the trigger so
which is going to be lights on/off this
is nothing but the animation and then
dot start so this is going to be the
event that is the angular will fire when
the animation has started so I'm going
to assign animation started as the
handler and this is going to accept
dollar event similarly we can also have
another event binding so instead of
trigger a trigger dot start we're going
to have trigger done and this we are
going to assign animation done and then
dollar event
so basically animation dot done is going
to be fired when the animation has
completed animation dot start when the
animation has begun so let's go ahead
and define these two methods now so
animation started and this is going to
accept event and over here
we are going to just log to the console
so console dot log start animation and
then we can get access to some of the
some information about the animation so
console dot log event dot you can say
from state and similarly console dot log
event dot to state and then finally you
can also get the total duration of the
animation so console dot log event dot
total time
and similarly I can define animation
done so animation started will be
changed to animation done and we are
going to move this to the bottom so an
animation completed our animation done
and then we are going to login the same
other information so when I save this
let's go over to our browser and this
has crashed I'm not sure why I'm just
going to reload this and also open the
console all right let me open the
console console ok there you go so now
if you have a look alright let me just
clear it and then trigger the animation
again so I'm going to click on toggle
lights it's going to start the animation
now it is going from off state which is
the front state to the on state and the
total duration is 5 seconds how is that
2 seconds duration plus 3 seconds delay
so the total time is 5 seconds so start
animation from 2 total time so start
animation from off to on total duration
5 thousand and similarly when the
animation completed again it's going to
be the same from off state we went to on
state for a duration of 5 thousand and
then animation is done so these three
are kind of redundant but I just wanted
to show you that there are accessible
now what you can do in these callbacks
is maybe assign new values and one thing
I thought that would work was chaining
animations so at the end of one
animation other than the first animation
I can trigger the second animation by
maybe setting this state value and at
the end of second animation I can
trigger the third and so on but
unfortunately it didn't work out as I
expected it to and all the animations
kind of happen simultaneously
is leave so I'm not sure if that is what
they were expecting but if I learn a
real practical use for animation
callbacks I'll let you know but for now
just remember that animations do have
callback and they can provide you some
valuable information so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget subscribe
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
