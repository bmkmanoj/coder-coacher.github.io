thing that I have to say here is that it
is possible to have different names for
a check box so I can have course one as
a name for the first check box and close
to its name for the second check box now
that I've got that off my chest let us
start learning about drop-down menus and
text areas now let's say we want to
create a drop-down menu in our forum
generally you use it where you want the
user to select a country and they just
have to click and it gives you a
drop-down list of all the countries that
are possible for the user to select but
right now let's just create an age group
so so let's have a label called age
group and to specify a drop-down menu we
are going to be using a tag called the
Select tag and the Select tag is going
to take another up tag called option now
this option is going to be the list of
options in the drop down menu now the
first thing we can have for the Select
is a name so let's say this is age and
in an option we can have the age group
of 10 to 20 now I'm just going to
quickly copy this and we can have
several options for the drop down menu
so let's say this is 20 30 40 50 and
then 30 40 50 60 so if we save this and
I reload it then i get an age group
label and then i drop down menu next to
this so if i click on the drop-down menu
i get the list of options that i can
select if i click on 30 to 40 and it
gets populated with 30 to 40 if i click
on 50 to 60 and gets populated with 50
to 60 pretty cool now let's say we want
to create a comment section where the
user can leave a comment in the form now
for that we are going to be making use
of and then the type of input called a
text area
so let's say comment and this is going
to be a text area tag now this text area
is going to have a name attribute once
again and that's no surprise right now
so comment but a text area you need to
specify rows and columns so how much how
many rows is this text area supposed to
take let's say three rows and how many
columns is it supposed to take let's say
10 columns so we have created a text
area that is going to be across three
rows and n columns now if we save this
and reload it so we have a comment label
and then a small text area next to it
now this text area can have three rows
and then once you start typing it's
going to converted and do a scroll bar
where you are going to have to scroll
but anyway three rows and then ten
columns is the amount of data it can
take and you can just click on the
bottom right and keep extending this and
if you minimize it it goes all the way
back but the minimum length is going to
be three rows and n columns no less so
that's pretty much it about the text
area and the drop-down menu and in the
next video let us understand about
submitting and resetting forms so thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
