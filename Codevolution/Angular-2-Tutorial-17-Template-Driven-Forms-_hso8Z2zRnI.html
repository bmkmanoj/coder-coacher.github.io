know the importance of forms in a web
application angular provides three
different ways to create forms for our
applications the first one is a template
driven approach which is very similar to
angular one forms the second one is a
model driven approach which is something
new in angular 2 and the third one is a
model driven approach with the form
builder API now in this video let us
learn the template driven approach to
form creation alright we are going to
start off with the hello world template
you can get a copy of this from my
github repo and a link is in the
description down below so when you run
npm install and then npm start we are
going to see hello world in the browser
so let's quickly change this hello well
to template driven forms let's save this
and when the browser is refreshed we
must be able to see template different
forms
all right great our app is working and
we can now proceed with the form
creation now to get access to all the
features of template driven forms we
need to import the forms module in our
root module so over here I'm going to
say import and what are we importing we
are importing the forms module so forms
module and we are importing this from
angular slash forms so now we can
include this forms module in our module
decorator because our app module is now
dependent on this forms module now we
can create a very simple HTML form with
bootstrap CSS in our app component to
capture some user data so in your index
dot HTML make sure that you have a
reference to bootstrap so let's go back
to app dot common in tortillas and
change template configuration to
template URL because the form is going
to be pretty lengthy and this is going
to be changed to a path
so in our app folder we are going to
create a file app component complement
dot HTML so now we can create this file
so AB dot component dot HTML and over
here we're going to start off with the
div tag and this is going to have a
class is equal to container this is a
bootstrap class and then let's have an
h2 that just says user form data or user
user just user data and then we can
create a form tag and within the form
tag we are going to have five fields
that are going to capture this user data
so div and then the class is equal to
form group so this is again a bootstrap
class this is purely for appearance
alone so form group and then a label tag
and this is going to be we don't really
need for so label and this is going to
be named and then we are going to have
an input tag so the type is going to be
text and we don't need a name or a value
but we do need a class so the class is
going to be form control again a
bootstrap class so we need four more of
these fields so I'm just going to copy
paste it so copy two three four five and
let me also increase my font size so
there you go and over here we need name
the second one we need an email from the
user and then let's go with street let's
go with city and then let's go with
postal code and then at the end we need
a button so button the type is going to
be submit and then the class is going
to be button and button primary then the
text is going to be just submit so now
let's save this and have a look at the
browser to see how the form looks so we
have user data at the top and then we
have five fields name email street city
and postal code with a submit button so
this is pretty good and although this
seems like simple HTML angular's magic
is already happening behind the scenes
now any time we use this form tag
angular attaches an NG form directive to
the tag that gives us valuable
information about the form so this ng
form directive gives us two important
things the first one is it gives us the
values from different form fields and
the second one is it indicates whether
the form is is in a valid state or an
invalid state so over here in our form
tag let's go ahead and add this MZ form
directive which is already created for
us and assign a reference variable to
this so I'm going to call this user form
and this is going to be equal to ng form
so now we have an instance of ng form
assigned to user form so this variable
now represents this entire form and it
just so happens that when a user clicks
on the submit button and ng submit event
is fired so let's also capture that
event so event binding if you remember
is going to be within parentheses so the
event fired is ng submit and this we are
going to assign a handler so what are we
going to do when we submit the form we
are going to capture the form values and
log the values so I'm going to call this
handler on submit and this is going to
take a parameter which is nothing but
this value so user form is going to have
a property called dot
value so this is going to give us the
value and we can go back to AB dot
component TS and over here in the class
we can specify on submit we are going to
take a parameter so this is going to be
value of type any and log to the console
so console dot log value so basically
what we are trying to achieve is gather
all the data from the form and then
display it in the console so when I save
this and head over to our application
and when I press f12 to have a look at
the console all right let's see console
now when I enter something let's go with
let's go with the Rob and then email is
Rob at email com alright let's just go
with the two values and when you click
on the submit button you see that
nothing is captured now this is because
we need to register our form controls
with the ng form directory ng form
directive so right now we have a ninja
form directive but there is no
indication that these form controls
belong to this entry form directive so
for that we specify two things a name
attribute and an NG model directive so
for every input element we need to have
a name so name is equal to and I'm going
to call this name and then an NG model
directive so NG model and then similarly
I'm going to copy paste this so two
three four and five now this is name
this is going to be email this is going
to be Street this is going to be City
and then finally postal code
so now every control that is registered
with this ng-model
is going to be part of this user form
value so when I save this and head over
to the browser and the application is
reloaded so I'm going to go with Rob and
then Rob dot email the streak let's go
with Baker Street City London and then
postal code let's go with a random
number one two three four five so now
when I click on submit we get this
object so name is Rob email is Rob email
Street is Baker Street City London and
then postal code one two three four five
so each of these names that we have
specified is going to be appearing here
in our console along with the value that
is specified informed value now let's
say that we want to group together
certain fields for example the street
city and postal code needs to be
logically grouped into an address field
so for that all you have to do is add a
div tag so div and assign ng-model
group directive so this is going to be
an address so basically we are telling
that we have a couple of ng models and
we want to group them together and then
refer to that as address field so now I
can copy form groups and move it inside
this address field so now when I save
this and the browser is refreshed let's
go ahead and enter the same thing Rob
Rob dot email the street is going to be
Baker Street city is going to be London
and then the postal code one two three
four five but this time when I click on
submit button it's going to be object
that is submitted may Rob email Rob
email but then we are going to be
submitting an address which is in turn
an object so when I expand this and
expand address we get city London postal
code one two three
for five and then and then we get the
street which is Baker so this is in the
alphabetical order so this is how you
create a form and then submit the data
so that it can be you know sent to a
server now let's take it a step further
let's say we want data binding for
example when the user loads the form or
the way the page is loaded we want
certain data to be prefilled into the
form so for that all you need to do is
create a property so let's create a
property called my name and assign it a
value of let's go with Brandon so now we
can go back to our HTML file and where
we specify okay let me close this where
we specify entry model we can use square
brackets for data binding and this is
going to be bound to my name which is
what we have just created so when I save
this and when the page is reloaded you
see that Brandon is already prefilled so
this is how you achieve data binding and
a practical example you can think of is
let's say you're placing an order on an
e-commerce site and you come to the
shipping address now the shipping
address is usually prefilled with the
user registration address so this is how
data binding is achieved you use ng
model square brackets and assign it the
property so ng model is equal to mining
and similarly we can even have two-way
binding so if you remember banana in a
box model so parentheses for banana and
the square brackets for box and my name
and then I can have a paragraph tag and
then use interpolation and use my name
so when I save this it's going to
display Brandon at the bottom so Brandon
and when I type something it is going to
give me a live preview of what I am
entering so this is how we achieve
two-way binding
all right so that's pretty much how you
create a template driven form you create
an HTML form you use ng form directive
and then assign it a reference variable
you use ng submit and capture all the
values using user form value and each
form control needs to have a name and
then the ng model directive to appear
with the ng form director and then it is
also possible to achieve one-way and
two-way data binding with template
driven phones now in the next video let
us see how to perform some basic
validation for this template driven form
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
