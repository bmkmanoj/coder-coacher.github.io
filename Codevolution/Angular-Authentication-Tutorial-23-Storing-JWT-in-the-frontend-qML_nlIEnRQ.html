tokens in the browser's local storage
now if we go back to visual studio code
and take a look at the register
component currently we are simply
logging the response from the register
API and we saw in the previous video
that the response is now the token
object now storing this token in the
browser is really simple and we will be
making use of local storage so in the
response error function let's add the
code it is going to be local storage dot
set item and then the key is going to be
token and then the value is going to be
response dot token and let's do the same
in the login component I'm going to copy
the response arrow function go to the
login component and then paste it all we
are doing is setting an item with the
key token and then the value is the
token from the server in the browser's
local storage let's go ahead and test it
out open the browser and in the
developer tools go to the application
panel over here select local storage and
select your application localhost colon
4200 now in the register view enter the
details I'm going to go with F at F
dot-com and then the password is F and
I'm going to click on register when the
user is successfully registered you
should see a new item in the local
storage with the key token and then the
value is the JSON web token that is
generated from the server similarly
let's test login so let's delete this
token navigate to the login view and
then enter the details I'm gonna go with
F at F comm and then the password is F
and I'm gonna click on login again you
should see the token that is set in the
local storage the key is the string
token and then the value is the token
generated in the server alright now that
we are able to store the token in the
then let's also quickly improve the user
experience when a user logs in our
registers now if either registration or
login was successful that means that the
user is authenticated so let's navigate
them to the special events view and for
that we make use of the router in the
register component import the router
inject it and then use the navigate
method so first import and then inject
and finally navigate so this dot router
dot navigate to the special events view
import inject and navigate let's repeat
the exact same code in the log in
component import the router inject it
and then navigate all right so now if we
go back to the browser and log in we
should be navigated to the special
events view a at a calm as heard is a
click on login it's going to take us to
the special events view similarly let's
also go back to the register view and
test if it words so register is going to
be L at L calm password is L and click
on register and it's going to take me to
the special events view all right as you
can see we now have a slightly better
user experience when a new user
registers or an existing user logs in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
