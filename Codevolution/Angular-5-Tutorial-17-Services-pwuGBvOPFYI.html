about services in angular now before we
understand what exactly is a service I
want to help you understand why
something like a service would be
required in the first place and to
explain that I have set up a very simple
application all it does is display a
list of employees let's take a look at
the code so we begin with the app module
the app module bootstraps the app
component in the app component we have a
template URL that points to app
component HTML in the app component HTML
we have welcome to code evolution and
under the title we have an Employee List
component so the selector for employee
list in the employee list component we
have a hard-coded array of employees
each employee has an ID a name and age
in the template we have an h2 tag that
says employee list and we use the ng for
directive to iterate over each employee
in the array and display just the name
of the employee so if we run this
application you must see the title code
evolution from the app component
welcome to code evolution and then the
list of employee names from the employee
list component so everything is working
perfectly fine but then we get a new
requirement and the new requirement is
that in a separate view we need to
display all the employee information the
ID name age all of them so we figure
that's not a problem and create a new
component to display the employee
details this will be the employee detail
component so again in the template we
make use of the ng 4 directive iterate
over each employee but this time we bind
all the details and not just the name so
ID name and age all are displayed but
here's the problem
if you take a look at the class
we don't have the employee array we have
it in our Employee List component but it
is localized only to this specific
component the employee detail component
has no employee data to bind to the view
now what would be a solution here I can
simply copy paste the employee array in
the employee detail component and our
application will work as expected so if
I copy this
and paste it in the employee detail
component class go to add component HTML
and add the employee detail component
save this and take a look at the browser
we can see the list of employees
followed by the details of all the
employees so does the solution work yes
it does is it the right solution it
definitely is not we are violating a few
good programming principles the first
one is the DRI principle which states do
not repeat yourself and this is the case
with the employee array we are making
copies of the same data
the second principle we are violating is
the single responsibility principle a
component class should have only one
responsibility and that is to control
the views logic but in our case it is
also responsible for creating the data
which is the employee array so we need a
better solution and that solution is a
service but what exactly is a service a
service is nothing but a class with a
specific purpose and why do we need
services the first reason is something
we learned from the example we need to
share data across multiple components so
in such a scenario a service will be
responsible for providing the data to
the components that ask for it the
second reason is to implement
application logic let's say an employee
enters their date of birth but we need
to calculate their age now we can write
the logic to do that this doesn't need a
view and the logic is reusable code
which should be independent of any
individual component so again in this
scenario we create a service and finally
we can also use services for external
interactions such as connecting to a
database in angular the naming
convention
is to end the filename with service dot
t s for example employee service would
be employee dot service dot t-- s and
the class name is employee service so
now that we know what a service is and
why we would want to use a service the
next question is how do we go about
using a service in angular and the
answer is dependency injection
what is dependency injection let's
understand that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
