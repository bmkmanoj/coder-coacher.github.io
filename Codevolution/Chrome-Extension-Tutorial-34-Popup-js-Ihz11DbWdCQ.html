of the puzzle and the pop up GS
basically takes the color the user
selected from the pop-up HTML and sends
it to the content script using messages
and the content script then reads this
message and changes the font color
accordingly so let's see how to do that
we're going to create a new file called
pop up yes so pop up yes and we're going
to start off with jQuery so dollar and
we're going to have a function now the
first thing we need to do is get the
value what the user has typed in the
color picker so war color is equal to
dollar we first need to select the input
box so font color and then dot well now
we also need to have this piece of code
so pound font color and we basically
listen to three different things so when
the value changes or when the user copy
pastes of alyou into the text box and
when there is something typed in the key
typed in the input box so on all these
three events we are going to execute a
function and what this does is basically
assigns that particular value so color
is equal to dollar this dot well so now
whatever the condition is we have the
value from the input text box so next
thing to do is listen to the click event
on this particular submit button so
button change we need to listen to that
so dollar we're going to first select
dollar button change so pound button
change the sorry but then change so on
this we're going to listen to the click
event we're going to have a function so
what we're basically doing is sending a
message to the tab
from where we clicked this particular
button so chrome dot tabs dot query and
we can specify the options so active so
active tab true and it should be in the
current window it's a current window
true and then we can have a function a
callback function which is going to give
us an area of tabs and we just need to
send a message to the first tab so
chrome tabs dot send message tabs of
0.80 and once we have the mess up once
we have the tab we can also specify what
the message contains so to do is going
to be change let's make this change
color and we're also going to have to
pass what was the color selected by the
user so clicked color is going to be
color alright now we have our pop-up
jeaious ready so let's save this and go
back to our content dodgers where we are
going to listen to that particular
message so chrome dot runtime dot on
message dot ad listener so we're going
to have a function and if you remember
it's going to have a request a sender
and ascend response excuse me
so when we have the request we check if
it is asking us to change the color so
equal if request or to do is equal to
change color then we are going to first
concatenate the value with hash so that
we have a valid hex code so this is
going to be equal to hash plus request
dot clicked color so if you see here we
have clicked color that is sent so that
clicked color over here
now we can go ahead and add this color
to any class or any particular tag we
want in our webpage so over here if you
have a look the entire article body is
in a class called
API so let's change the color in class
API so dollar dot API and I'm just going
to say dot CSS we're going to change the
color and this is going to be add color
alright and that's it our extension is
now completed let's reload this and test
it one last time so I'm going to go to
your extensions page and reload the
extension so reload this let's refresh
it right so we have this particular blue
color from the CSS and if I click on
this and select let's say green and
click on change there you go all the
font is now green and let me change this
to red and click on change all the font
is now red so this is the basic idea how
you change the CSS or basically style on
a web page using content script now I
just change the color but you can
basically do anything you want with this
and there you go you have your very
first page action extension</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
