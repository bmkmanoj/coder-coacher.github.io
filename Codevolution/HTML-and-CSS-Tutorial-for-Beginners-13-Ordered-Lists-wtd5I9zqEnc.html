ordered list and we use them when we
want to have some sort of ordering
within the list so let's say we want to
let's have the different part of the
matrix trilogy and in the order of the
release so we can have AB h3 we can
replace this by matrix matrix trilogy
and then instead of an unordered list we
can have an ordered list so we have 0 L
tag which is used for the ordered list
and then once again each item is the
stead using the l ID tag so instead of
bread we are going to have let's see
enter the matrix then we are having
matrix reloaded and then Matrix
Revolutions so when I save this go back
to list dot HTML and reload it this is
Magic strategy and this time it is going
to append numbers to our list we have
first movie which was released was
entered the matrix and we have matrix
reloaded then Matrix Revolutions now
once again we also have a type attribute
for our order list and we can have let's
say eight when I specify a capital or
uppercase a save it and reload it it is
going to list out with ABC in uppercase
and if i change the uppercase a to
smaller or the lowercase a and replace I
mean reloaded it gives you the list and
the lowercase so ABC now another option
we have is capital I which is for Roman
numerals so when you reload
it gives you the list and the Roman
numerals and once again if you specify a
lowercase I and refreshing is going to
list out your items and the lowercase
Roman anywhere else my default is one
which is going to be the regular
numbering system and these types are
something that is already predefined you
cannot add let's say for an unordered
list I can hard have like a diamond
instead of square or a circle so you
need to check out what are the possible
options for the type attribute and use
only those so anyway that's pretty much
it i would ordered list thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
