understanding of es6 we can move on to
learning some of the features that
typescript has to offer so what is
typescript as I've already mentioned in
the very first video typescript is a
typed superset of JavaScript that
compiles to plain JavaScript so we now
have data types that can be made use of
while writing our code but specifying
the data type is completely optional so
we still can write regular JavaScript
code and it would work so why would we
want to learn typescript now one of the
main difficulties while writing
javascript is the inability to identify
mistakes during development sometimes we
are not sure if the scope of a variable
exists or not while using it and
sometimes we would be assigning a string
value to an integer value which was
declared with the purpose of having only
integer values or we might even call a
function with mismatched parameters now
typescript handles all these by
providing the features that a text
editor can make use of to signal a read
fly right away as and when we are
writing our code so typescript leads to
lesser mistakes which implies better
development of code and also typescript
is the official language that angular 2
makes use of and that's pretty pretty
good reason to learn typescript as well
and finally what I would like to point
out is that typescript is equal to yes
five features plus es 6 plus es 7 plus
some of its own features so by learning
es 2015 we have in fact learned a huge
portion of typescript so all that is
left is to learn some features that
typescript has taken from es 7 like
decorators and some of its own features
like the data types so let's get started
from the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
