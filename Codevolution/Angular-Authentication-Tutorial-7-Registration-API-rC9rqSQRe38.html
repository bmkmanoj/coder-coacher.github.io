create an API to register a new user in
MongoDB here is the overview of how it
works you fill up the email and the
password in the front-end and submit the
form the user data is sent to the API
endpoint that internally saves the user
into MongoDB using Mongoose so let's see
how to achieve this in code I'm going to
go back to visual studio code and right
below the router get method I'm gonna
add a new method to handle the request
and this will be a post request to the
endpoint register so router dot post to
register as a callback we get access to
the request and the response now within
the function body the first step is to
extract the user information from the
request body so let user data is equal
to request dot body next this user data
has to be cast into the user model that
Mongoose can understand remember we
created a user model in user chairs
right here let's import it in API chairs
so const user is equal to require one
folder up so dot dot and then in the
models folder from the user dot JS file
imported now with this let's create a
user model out of this user data let
user is equal to new user passing in the
user data and now that we have a user
that mongoose understands the structure
of the final step is to save it into the
database and mongoose provides a really
simple way to do that on the user object
or user model you simply call the save
method so user
save as a callback this method gives
either an error or the registered user
if there is an error let's log into the
console else let's send a status of 200
and also the details of the registered
user so rest dot status dot send
registered user and that is our
registration API extract the user data
from the request object converted into
the model that Mongoose understands and
save that user into the database now
let's test this API to see if it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
