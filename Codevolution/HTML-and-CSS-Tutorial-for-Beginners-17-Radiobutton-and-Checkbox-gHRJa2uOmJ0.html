we are going to be learning two more
types of input which is a radio button
and a checkbox now radio buttons are
used when we want the user to select one
out of a few choices so let's say in our
user registration form we need the user
to enter the gender now it can either be
male or female so they have to select
one of them so we are going to be using
the input tag once again but this time
we are going to be using a type called
radio and this is for the radio buttons
now it will take a name let's say gender
and it also takes a value so this is
once again used when processing the
input so the value is going to be lets
say male and then once again we give a
label next to it which specifies it as
male and then we can have another input
now this time the input is going to be
for female but here's the thing for
radio buttons the name is going to
remain the same across all the buttons
so if you have two buttons the gender is
going to be the name for both the
buttons and let's say if you have if
you're accepting for five buttons the
name has to remain the same across all
five buttons the value can have ever
differ and this is going to be female
and we can have a label called female
and when we save it and reload our forms
dot HTML we have two radio buttons one
for male and one for female now the user
can either select mail or they can
select female but they cannot select
both now if you want one of the radio
buttons to be selected when the page is
loaded then we can go ahead and use
checked with in the input tag so when we
save it if you notice we have the mail
as checked so reloaded and mail is going
to be selected
now the second type is the check box so
let's say we need what we need we need
the courses that the user wants to
enroll to let's say it cautious now the
user can either select none of the
course or all of the courses or anything
in between so we can have an input once
again and this is going to be type is
equal to check box and the name is going
to be lets say course and the value is
going to be hmmm let's say HTML we can
have a label for HTML you have a right
tag here sorry about that so we can have
another input and this time the type is
once again going to be type is equal to
check box name is still going to remain
course and then value is going to be
equal to let's say CSS whoops all right
CSS and we can have labeled CSS now when
we save it reload it we have courses now
HTML and CSS now a check box allows you
to select any number of inputs so I can
select both HTML and CSS I can select
just CSS I can select just HTML or I
don't have to select any of them at all
once again if you want the check box to
be ticked when the page is loaded just
include checked and it is going to be
selected so when we save it and reload
it there you go where'd of them are
selected so there's the tumor types of
input and in the next video we are going
to be learning how to have a drop-down
menu as an input and also have
you have a text area as an input where
you know you can provide a comment or
some sort of feedback so thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
