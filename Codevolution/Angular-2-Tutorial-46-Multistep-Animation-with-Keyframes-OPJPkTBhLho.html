how to add multi-step animation with
keyframes now in the last video we added
the enter and leave animations but here
we have just one style during the
transition time of one second but what
if we want to have a style for the first
one second and then change the style for
the next second and add multiple styles
as time progresses now this is where
keyframes come into picture and to save
us some time I'm going to swap in the
new code for keyframes all right there
you go now here's how keyframes are
going to work first we need to import
keyframes from angular slash core and
then over here in the transition in the
animate function as a second parameter
we are going to specify keyframes and
this keyframes is going to take in an
array of styles so instead of specifying
just a single style we use the keyword
keyframes and then specify multiple
styles and here's how each of these
Styles work
alright let's consider the first one the
enter animation now each of the style is
going to have an offset value so this is
basically the time at which this
particular style is going to get applied
in this transition of one second
so offset zero means to say initially we
are going to start with an opacity of
zero and then translate by minus 100%
and then at point three seconds so point
three of thousand milliseconds which is
300 milliseconds or at point three
seconds a new style is going to be
applied and what is that style translate
X by 15 pixels so translate to the right
by 15 pixels and offset at 1 so at one
second basically at the end of this
transition we are going to translate it
back to its original position and
similarly for the exit animation we are
specifying three different styles we
to start with opacity 1 to opacity 0 and
then we are also going to transform so
initially at 0 it's going to be at its
designated position at a point 7
milliseconds so we 0.7 seconds or 700
milliseconds because the duration is
thousand milliseconds it is going to
shift to the left by 15 pixel and then
it is going to at the end of one second
finally transition away from the screen
so 100% so let's just have a look and
you can maybe understand the animation
better I'm just going to zoom in so that
you can have alright so observe this is
the original position when it is going
to exit from the screen it is first
going to translate by minus 15 pixels so
it is going to move a bit to the left
and then finally move away from the
screen so exit the screen I'm going to
click here see to the left and then it
exits and similarly when it is going to
enter from the left is going to up here
it is going to have 15 pixels to the
right and then come back to its original
position so click on toggle Dib see it
appear over here and then it goes back
kind of like a catapult effect maybe you
pull it and then send it off and then
when it comes it bounces back and then
goes to its original position so
basically that was the concept in this
video how to use keyframes to specify
multiple styles during animation for a
transition so that is all I have for
animations a couple more features are
going to be added pretty soon maybe help
to animate child elements and so on but
what you have learned so far should
serve as a good base from where you can
understand any new concept so thank you
guys for watching go 3 to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
