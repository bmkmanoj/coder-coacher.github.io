35 and in this video we are going to
learn how to pass optional parameters
while navigating from one view to
another so here's the new requirement
for our application we need a back
button in the department detailed
component and when we click on this
button we should be navigated to the
department list component and the
additional requirement is that when we
navigate back to this department list
component the previously clicked on
department should be highlighted so if I
click on angular and then go to
Department detail component and then
click on back and then head back to
department list component this angular
item should be highlighted so let's see
how to achieve this with optional road
parameters the first thing is we need to
have this back button in the department
detail component so we're here
underneath next and previous I'm going
to have this button so button and then
let's also close the button tag and this
button basically tells us to go back now
we need to listen to the click event on
this button and when we click on this we
need to go to the department list so I'm
going to have a handler called go to
department and then let's go ahead and
define this method so we have go
previous and go next and similarly go to
departments now over here what we need
to do is navigate back to departments
and then pass in the current selected
department ID so I'm going to create
lead selected ID as a local variable
this is going to be equal to Department
ID and I'm also going to make sure that
if it is null I pass in No
so department ID else null now after
this we're going to use the router
service so this dot router dot navigate
the navigate method and then we're going
to have the link parameter array so the
first item or the first item in this
parameter
ray is the destination and that is
nothing but the department and then to
specify optional parameters we use an
object with a key value pairs so first
we specify the parameter which is
nothing but the key and its value which
is nothing but selected ID so ID is the
key selected ID is the value all right
so now what we are doing is we are
sending this optional parameter ID to
the department list component so let's
go over to the department list component
and capture that parameter value and to
retrieve that out parameter we do the
exact same thing we did in the last
video we are going to make use of the
palem observable so let's make sure
first that we implement the on init
method so implement on in it and then we
also need to define this ng on in it and
we can just copy/paste what we did with
department detail so over here under the
department salary that I have I'm going
to paste this ng on in it now route is
not defined so let's also have its
injection so private route and that is
nothing but the activated route so
actuated route and then you also need to
import it and patterns has a red
squiggly so let's go ahead and import
that as well so parents now instead of
department ID I'm going to use another
variable so I'm going to declare public
selected ID this is nothing but the ID
of the department that was clicked on so
this dot selected ID is equal to ID so
what we are doing is from Department
detail we have sent the ID so in
department list we are going to go
through this patterns observable get
this ID assign it assign the value to
this local variable and then assign it
to
properly selected ID now the next step
is to make sure that we highlight the
department that has the same ID as this
selected ID so what do is so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to have a
function is selected this is going to
take in the Department and it is going
to basically return true or false and it
is going to return true if this
department dot ID is the same as the
selected ID and where are we going to
have this we are going to make use of
this in the list item tag to have class
binding so over here I specify square
brackets class dot selected and let me
quickly go to the size dot CSS and when
I so when this items or allied tag has a
class called selected I'm basically just
changing the background color and the
font color so this is going to give the
appearance that that particular item is
selected so let's go back to department
list over here close this so class dot
selected apply a class called selected
when the right hand side of this
expression is going to be true and what
is what are we specifying on the right
hand side the east selected function so
is selected in passing the department
that is under the current iteration so
Department Department yeah that's
correct
so now I'm going to save this and I'm
going to go back to our application so I
have departments I click on angular it
goes to departments slash one I say it
says that you're selected the department
with ID is equal to one I have a back
button when I click on back and there
you go we pass in this optional ID
parameter so ID is equal to one and then
if you see angular which has ID equals
one is highlighted and if I do with node
go back now
selected the same with Mongo go back
Mongo is selected now the difference
between a required parameter and an
optional parameter is that required
parameter for example in the case of
navigating to Department detail
component this ID is a must so I need an
ID to navigate to the particular
department detail but optional parameter
over here if you have a look I can
navigate to departments and I don't need
to specify this ID I'm just using it so
that I can do some work for example
highlighting a particular department
using this so an optional parameter is
not going to affect your route in any
manner but a required parameter is going
to affect it it is going to check an
aprotic module and it is going to match
this path but an optional parameter is
not going to do so so just to
demonstrate that over here in department
detail component I can even specify
additional let's say random value so
random I'm going to and this going to
contain a string called random so let's
save this I'm going to go to angular ok
neat I need to wait for this to reload
alright so departments so I'm going to
click on angular so Department if you
have a look at the URL Department slash
one if I click on back I get ID is equal
to one and another key value pair random
is equal to random so this doesn't
affect my view in any manner whatsoever
I just pass it so that I can capture
this and do some functionality if I have
so in our case we need to highlight the
particular department so I passed it as
ID and then highlighted it and just to
go over the code one more time so that
you get a good understanding I have a
button and when I click on this back
button I call this method go to
departments in the go to departments I
select the current department ID that
hire that I have visited and this I am
passing in as an optional parameter so
we are going to navigate to departments
with ID as an optional parameter over
here I'm going to capture it using the
param
observable and then I use a selected
function or method to make sure that it
is the same department ID as the
selected ID when we iterate over the
departments and if it tastes the same
I'm going to apply a class called
selected and that is how we are
highlighting using optional parameters
all right so that pretty much does it
