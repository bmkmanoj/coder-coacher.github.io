learned how to insert a document into a
collection now in this video let us see
how to query for the documents with some
find criteria so what I've done is
created a new file called find dot PHP
and I have included these lines of code
the first one is to require and then I
also have the dollar client to
instantiate the MongoDB client class I
also have selected the company database
and also the employee collection now let
us see how to find documents within this
employee collection now there are two
methods the first one is to select a
single document or to find a single
document and the second one is to find
all the documents that match the given
criteria so let's give it find in
finding a single document so let's
create a new variable to store the
retrieved document it's a dollar
document and our method is going to work
on the collection so employee collection
object operator and then the method is
find one now let's go ahead and specify
the find criteria so let's say we want
to retrieve the document whose ID
matches one so underscore ID and then
it's going to be one now let's use
variable dumb dollar document so if you
have a look at insert dot PHP we had ID
one named Andrew so over here we are
selecting Android document so let's go
to our browser go to find out PHP and
control U and there you go we have ID
one which was our matching criteria and
we have the rest of the fields in the
document so name was Andrew age 26
scaled MongoDB so that's how you find a
single document now we can also find
more than one document using the find
method so let me go ahead and comment
this
out so let's go to our instant dot php'
now if you look at ID 1 and ID 2 both of
them have a skill of MongoDB
so let's retrieve the document with
skill is MongoDB so let's have dollar
document list is equal to dollar
employee collection now because our find
method is going to be on the collection
so we just specify find now let's go
ahead and mention the criteria we are
going to find all the documents where
the skill is MongoDB so Mongo DB now we
are going to get a list of documents so
we need to iterate through each document
in that list so we are going to use the
for each loop so dollar document yes as
let's say dollar doc all right so
variable dump dollar doc so what we are
doing is iterating through every
document that was selected and put in
the document list and we are going to in
each iteration assign it to dollar
document and then dump it out so let's
save this and now when we refresh it
control you
yep so we have string ID one and true
the skill is MongoDB we also have ID to
Brad the skill s MongoDB so that's
pretty much it how you retrieve a single
document or multiple documents from a
collection you use the fine method or
the fine one method so thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
