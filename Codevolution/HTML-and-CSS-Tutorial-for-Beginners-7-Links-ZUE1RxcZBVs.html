seven now i'm pretty sure you guys will
come across a web page where you click
on some text or an image and then boom
you are taken away to a whole different
web page or some document now such text
or images are called hyperlinks and in
HTML to create links we make use of an
anchor tag which is denoted by a so
let's understand with some code how
links work in HTML now we have our
description about friends over here but
you know it's just two lines and let's
face it I'm pretty lazy to type out more
lines or even just copy paste some more
lines and if you go to the wikipedia
page on friends or here then you get a
whole lot of description about friends
so what we can do is right below these
two lines we can just add another line
that says for more information click
here and then when that is clicked we
can take the user to this Wikipedia page
so let's do that let's go back to your
sublime text and right below our
paragraph let's create another paragraph
sorry about that so let's create another
paragraph chillin let's say for more
info check out this wiki link now still
this is just text in order to convert
this text to a link we need to surround
it with an anchor tag or the a tag so
open a tag and after this let's close
the a tag so this entire text now is
going to act as link
wait a minute how does it know where to
go well we click that particular link so
just this word we killing mean that it
has to go to the wikipedia page well not
exactly we need to use an attribute
called href so within the opening tag
type a tree which is the name of our
attribute and the value is going to be
the URL or the link where we need to go
to so just copy the URL from this
wikipedia page then go back and you know
href specify that as the value so we
have a href is equal to the URL of the
wikipedia page and then some text which
is going to act as link so if we save
this and we reload it so we get this new
link for more info check out this wiki
link when we click this we are going to
be taken to our friends page in
Wikipedia so cool so cool now let's say
we have another page called Chandler
HTML in our own folder over here let's
see how to navigate between pages that
we have created ourselves so let's say a
new file and save it as Chandler dot
HTML alright and let's have some basic
HTML structure so doctype HTML and then
HD HTML close the HTML tag let's say we
have a head tag and believe that we have
a body tag within the body tag say this
is about Chandler let's of course and
close it within a paragraph tag
alright let's save this now excuse me
now let's create another link so let's
say we want to create a link where the
user clicks on it and they're taken to
Chandler HTML so once again we are going
to be using the anchor tag so a now the
href is going to be Chandler HTML since
it is present in the same location now
we can say about Chandler and when we
save it and we reload this page we have
a new link called about Chandler let me
click this we are taken to Chandler so
Chandler dot HTML where this is our
Chandler is displayed so if you go back
to your channel dot HTML and type
another paragraph and within the
paragraph an anchor tag this time let's
say we want to go back to our main page
so index dot HTML and with which between
the opening tag and the closing tag
let's say back to friends and save it
when we reload it so we can go back to
this front page when we click on our
Chandler we go back to Chandler page and
this is basically how you create
navigation between the different pages
in your website so tip summarize we have
an anchor tag so we have an anchor tag
over here to create links and we have
the href attribute to define the link
address now it is also possible to link
to existing URLs such as Wikipedia or it
is also possible to create links to the
web pages we have created ourselves so

to subscribe i'll see you in the next
video where we are going to learn a bit
more about links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
