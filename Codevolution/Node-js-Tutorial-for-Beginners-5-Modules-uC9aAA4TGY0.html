we are going to be learning about
modules now sometimes when you're
building your application it can contain
thousands of lines of code and having
all the codes in a single file can be
confusing sometimes so what we need to
do is break down this code and put them
in to individual files say file1 file2 5
3 now in no chairs each of these
individual files is called a module now
when creating creating a module you
don't just separate our code let's say
first 50 lines go into file 1 the next
50 lines of code go into file to you and
the next hundred go into file 3 now a
module is going to contain related code
so let's see how we can understand
modules using node.js code now we have
our app just a blank file so let's
create a new file and save it as let's
say at all it takes
dart chess now let's create two
functions the first one is function
relay and let's just type control dot
log there is relay function and let's
have a second function called from sorry
so let's give it a name called long jump
so long jump and let's console dot log
this is long jump function now we have
our main file which is the app yes and
we have a separate file Athletics DRGs
now if you want to convert this athletic
star just into a module then we need to
write this piece of code
so module dot exports dot relay is equal
to relay now this relay belongs to the
module export this relay belongs to the
name of the function relay so save it
and go back to Abdo chess and to make
use of our athletics module we are going
to type variable athletics
adlet x is equal to we're going to be
making use of a keyword called require
to import modules and it's going to take
a parameter which is the name of the
file
now since athletics is in the same
directory as i've ab dodgers we need to
type dot and then front slash and then
we type athletics and that takes dot you
know you can just ignore the dot yes so
a variable athletics is equal to require
athletics and then we can say athletics
dot relay figurehead save it save
Atlantic's open come on truant and say
node app dot yes now this is really
function so how did this work you know
AB dot yes we have requested for a
module or in simple terms a file called
athletics so this is the file and then
we say we have stir this file in a
variable called athletics so this
athletics has access to this function
relay since we have exported the relief
function we can make use of this in
there a BS so when we call athletics
start relay it goes to athletics file
and then called this function and i in
our console this is really function is
printed as we see here
since we don't have a long jump function
you know exported using this module dot
exports if you go ahead and type at
athletics dot long jump save it and when
we run again says this error the
Athletics dot long jump is not a
function so I can just type module dot
exports dot long jump it's equal to long
jump and save it save it now I'm ready
type note up yes it says this is really
function and this is long jump function
now what I'm trying to highlight here is
that if you want some piece of code to
be used only within that particular
module then don't export it and if you
want the code to be shared between files
then use the module don't export assign
it to a variable and then in our main
file you can use the required keyword to
import the module and then you can call
the corresponding function now do you
mean to say that if you had if we had a
hundred functions would we be writing
modules dot experts hundreds hundred
times well absolutely not
we can make use of this module dot
experts object and a name value fashion
so just let me just leave one a lot
experts and type module dot exports
sorry
module dot expert is equal to now
initially every module is going to have
this module dot exports implicitly
defined and then assigned to empty
records now what we want to do is create
name value pairs so name would be really
and then its value would be our function
so function and then console dot log and
we can
just type this is the relay function and
then we can have a second one long jump
as a name and then its value is going to
be a function console dot log this is
the long jump function that we have
replaced these two functions by passing
it as values over here and we have
eliminated these two lines of code by
using this module dot exports object so
we can delete this now save it say your
app dot yes if we go back and execute we
still have the is the relay function
type home yep and then this is the long
jump function now that's it about how
that's it about modules and how we
create our own modules in know chess and
in the next video I'm going to be
talking about one of the core modules or
a built-in module that nodejs provides
us with so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
