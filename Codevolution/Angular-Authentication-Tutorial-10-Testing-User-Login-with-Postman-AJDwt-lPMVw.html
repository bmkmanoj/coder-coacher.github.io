login API so make sure you've restarted
the server and then head to postman
first we select the request method log
in is a post request then we enter the
URL localhost port 3000 slash API slash
login this is our API endpoint next
let's set the content type so click on
the header tab and then the key is going
to be content type and then the value is
going to be application slash JSON next
in the body tab select RAW format and
over here we are going to create a JSON
object of the user now there are three
cases for testing user login first is
the invalid email scenario so I'm going
to create a user with an email that
doesn't exist in our database so the
email is going to be B at b.com and the
password I'm gonna go with a now when I
click on send request and scroll down to
the bottom you can see that we get a 401
on authorized status with a message
invalid email and we can trace this in
our code so first we are going to try to
find a user whose email ID matches that
of the user that we are passing if there
was no user found we are saying that
it's an invalid email and that is
exactly what we are seeing here in
postman so that works perfectly fine now
for the second scenario I'm going to
enter a registered email but with an
invalid password so we do have a user
with the email address a at a comm
register but this time I'm going to
change the password to an invalid
password B a is the original password
matching this email address but I am
changing it to be so now when I click on
send and when I scroll down to the
bottom you
can see that 401 unauthorized with
invalid password so in our code what
happens is it in fact finds an email
address with the user email address that
we have passed so this condition doesn't
get executed next it checks if the
passwords match so the user password in
the database is the letter A but we are
passing the password letter B so the two
passwords do not match and we get back
the response for a one with the message
invalid password so the second scenario
works as well now for our final scenario
let's try with valid credentials
matching email and password so I'm going
to change the password to a and then I'm
going to click on the send button so if
you navigate to the bottom you can see
status 200 ok and then the details of
that particular user so email is a comm
and then the password is a so the login
API works perfectly fine now what
exactly do we mean by logging in a user
we will come to that when we are working
with our angular application but for now
a login API works as expected next let's
create an API to get regular and special
events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
