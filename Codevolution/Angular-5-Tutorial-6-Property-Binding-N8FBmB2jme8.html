learn about property binding in angular
now before we get into the syntax of
property binding it is very important
that you understand the difference
between an HTML attribute and a Dom
property so consider an input element
input type is equal to text and value is
equal to which was now in the browser we
have the input element filled with the
string which was and take a look at this
if I inspect this element and then in
the console type dollar zero a dollar
zero represents the current element
which is the input element dot get
attribute of value we can see Vishwas
similarly if I type dollar zero dot
value we can see again which was now if
I change the text to code evolution in
the input element and then repeat the
same two commands you can see that get
attribute still returns which was but
the value property now returns code
evolution so the attribute did not
change but the value property did change
from this example here are some of the
points you need to make note of
attributes and properties are not the
same attributes are defined by HTML but
properties are defined by the document
object model attributes initialize Dom
properties and then they are done
attribute values cannot change once they
are initialized property values however
can change so in our example back in the
browser the HTML attribute value
specifies the initial value the Dom
value property is the current value so
the value attribute remains the same
whereas the value property changed now
why did I explain this I explained it
because in the code at first glance
property binding is going to seem like
we
binding to the HTML attribute while we
are actually binding to the Dom property
to avoid that confusion I had to give
you an example about attributes versus
properties so with property binding in
angular we are actually binding to the
property of the Dom element alright
let's take a look at an example so let's
go back to visual studio code let's
create a new property and this I'm going
to call it public my ID is equal to test
ID and we need to bind this value to the
HTML ID property of this input element
and here is the syntax we enclose ID
within square brackets and to this we
assign the property and what is the
property the property is my ID now if we
save this and take a look at the browser
you can see that for this input element
the ID is set to test ID which is the
value of this my ID property so we are
binding to the ID property of this input
element
hence property binding but you may ask
can we not use interpolation to bind to
the ID of the element the answer is yes
you can so I can copy this paste it and
instead of using the square brackets and
property binding I can use double curly
braces for my ID and if you take a look
at the browser you can see that ID is
still set to test ID for this input
element as well so why do we need
property binding well there is a
limitation to interpolation it can only
work with string values and there are
HTML properties that are boolean
properties that we may need to sometimes
bind to let's take a look at an example
consider the disabled attribute of an
input element by default it is always
set to false so the input is always
enabled now let's add the disabled
attribute and now if we take a look at
the browser you can see that the second
input element is this
and back in our code now let's try to
set this disabled attribute to false so
false and if you take a look at the
browser again you can see that the input
is still disabled so this is a problem
with boolean attributes such as disabled
when you add the disabled attribute its
presence alone initializes the inputs
disabled property to true so the input
is disabled setting the value to false
has no effect and because it is a
boolean attribute that needs true or
false
interpolation doesn't work so if I even
set this to false within double curly
braces head back to the browser the
input is still disabled so the solution
here is to use property binding so
instead of using double curly braces
which does not work we are going to
enclose disabled within square brackets
and then assign it either true or false
now that we have set it to false
it means the input is not disabled and
if you go back to the browser you can
see that both the input elements are
enabled
I can type anything I want to and back
in code if we set disabled to true and
then go back to the browser you can see
that the second input element is now
disabled of course hard-coding true or
false is not of much use so let's create
a property in the class and then bind it
so I'm gonna add a new property I'm
going to call this public is disabled
and set it to true
now instead of binding it to a true or
false value we bind it to the east
disabled property right now is disabled
is set to true so in the browser the
second input element is still disabled
go back to the code set is disabled to
false and in the browser the second
input element is not disabled anymore
again
I am changing the value manually but you
can control the property based on user
interactions or some other data for
example you can toggle the disable
property of an input or a button based
on a mouse click that the user performs
while filling out a form finally there
is an alternate syntax for property
binding so instead of using the square
brackets you can use bind - with the
attribute name so remove the square
brackets and use bind
- so if we take a look at the browser
both inputs are enabled well that is
about property binding in angular thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
