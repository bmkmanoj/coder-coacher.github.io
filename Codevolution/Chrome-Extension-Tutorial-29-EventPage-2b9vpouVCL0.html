extension and make the pop-up accessible
needs to go in an event page why that's
because even the page runs in the
background and moreover our very purpose
is to access the pop-up dot HTML so if
we were to write our code in pop-up J's
we would never be able to reach that
code because pop-up dot HTML where we
reference the pop-up dodges is
inaccessible so for our next step we
need an event page that highlights our
extension so right here now first we
need to edit the manifest for that so
let's go back to our manifest dot JSON
and I'm going to specify background and
this background is going to take an
object we're going to specify the
scripts that run in the background this
is going to be an array but for now it's
just going to be the event page dot
chairs we also need to specify the
persistent to be equal to false because
this is an event page and if you want to
learn about background pages and event
pages in a bit more detail I recommend
you to go through the previous extension
alright now that we have our manifest
ready we can create the event page so
event page dot HS now to specify or
highlight our icon or page action icon
we have a chrome API but first we need
to ask chrome to retrieve all the tabs
so that we can show the AK icon so let
me explain SN when I write this
extension API so chrome dot tabs dot
query so what this does is this method
retrieves all the tabs and we can
specify the options so I'm going to say
the tab has to be an active tab and it
has to be in the current window so
current window is also going to be true
and then there's going to give us a
callback function with all the tabs and
area of tabs to be more precise now that
we have all the tabs let me just
light the icon in the tab where the
extension is loaded now to show or
highlight the page action I can't we use
chrome dot page action dot show and this
is going to take tabs of 0.80 so this
tabs right here we just need one
particular tab and it's ID so now since
we use this chrome tabs we also need to
request for request for permissions so
we're here I'm going to say permissions
and what do I need permissions for I
need permissions for all the tabs so now
let's save this and reload our extension
so if you have a look the icon currently
is grayed out now I'm going to reload
this and there you go the icon is now
highlighted so we are able to highlight
our page extension but for us the icon
should be highlighted only on this
chrome developer com pages so if you
notice here it is not yet highlighted so
to highlight our page action icon on
specific pages we need to make use of
something known as content scripts let's
learn about that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
