your project and if the package makes
sense only for that specific project you
can install the package locally in the
project folder and the command to
install a package locally is NPM install
followed by the command name for example
let's consider this NPM folder as our
project folder and we want to install a
package locally within this folder for
that open command prompt in that
particular folder and run the command
NPM install followed by the package name
the package we are going to be
installing this moment which is
basically a JavaScript date library and
this is purely for an example you can
install any package you wish to now when
I run NPM install moment is going to
take a couple of seconds and then create
a particular folder called node modules
in our project folder and within this
folder we are going to find the package
we installed and at this moment now if
you install more packages all those
packages are going to be created in this
node modules folder but if you have a
look at our package dot JSON file there
is no corresponding entry for that
package and I didn't mention that
package dot JSON file is going to help
track our project dependencies or what
are the packages that our project
depends on and right now we don't see
moment now to save the package as a
dependency in your package JSON file you
need to use the - - save flag so I'm
going to go back to NPM folder and
remove this node modules folder so that
you don't get confused and I'm going to
type NPM install moment and then just
add the - - save flag now when I run
this it is going to do the exact same
thing it's going to create a node
modules folder and within that moment
but this time it's also going to create
an entry saying dependencies and then it
is going to say the package name so
we're just moment and the version we
have installed so we have a dependency
on the moment library
so that is what it means excuse me and
if you want to install packages just for
development purpose and not production
then you can make use of the - dev flag
now let's go back over to our command
prompt and NPM install install now
generally you might want to make use of
something like a testing package such as
mocha or karma as your dev dependencies
but they're pretty large and for just
for example I'm going to make use of low
- package and NPM install low - - - save
- them so what we mean to say is that
this is just a development dependency
package and this really isn't required
for production so when I run NPM install
OH - - - save - dev it's going to create
with an own modules a package for low -
so I'm going to wait for this to
complete and there you go we have the
package for low - but if you have a look
at the package dot JSON file it's going
to create a different dependency
something called as dev dependency and
again it's going to specify the package
name and the version that our project is
using so low - as a dev dependent dev
dependency and moment is a production
dependencies and that is how you install
dependencies and dev dependencies for
your projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
