and in this video let us have a look at
the default function parameters in
es2015 now in es5 or javascript when a
parameter is not specified for a
function during its call then the value
would be undefined let's look at an
example let me create a simple function
a gate value is equal to function this
takes value and just logs value so
console console dot log value now let's
call this function without specifying an
argument so let me save this and have a
look at a browser say it's undefined
now but now in es 2015 we can set
default values for parameters in
parentheses so let's have a look at
couple of examples first thing I'm going
to do is value is equal to 10 so we can
specify a default value to a parameter
using assignment operator so what this
implies is that if you call this
function with the value it is going to
log the value if you don't call it with
a value then it is going to log 10 every
single time so let's call the gate value
again but this time with a value 10 okay
let me change it to 20 because it might
seem confusing so 10 and 20 let's save
this 10 and 20 so there was no parameter
specified as an organ argument specified
it's going to take the default value of
10 if an argument is specified it is
going to take that value and behave as
it would do normally so 20 would be
displayed on the console now let us have
a look at the function with two
parameters so let me create bonus and
this is going to be equal to 5 and let's
call get value 20 it's also called get
value with 20
and let's give a bonus of 30 and let's
also call get value with the first
parameter undefined and second parameter
30 now let's see how the output for
these functions work we've got the
output let's see how this works okay
we also are going to log console value
plus bonus okay so the first one get
value without any argument now well no
argument is specified both parameters
they're going to take their default
values so 10 and 5 so 10 plus 5 is 15
thus what we are going to see here in
our console 15 the second one get value
of 20 so we have specified a value for
our first parameter so value is going to
be 20 but bonus there is no pal
there's no argument over here so bonus
is going to take the default value of 5
so 20 plus 5 which is 25 over here in
our console and third one 20 comma 30 so
we are specifying both our parameters so
default values do not come into picture
at all so value plus bonus is going to
be 20 plus 30 and 50 that's correct
and finally we call the first parameter
with undefined and the second parameter
with 30 so when this undefined it is
going to take the default value so 10
plus 30 which is going to be 40 over
here so when you want to when you don't
want to specify a parameter on the
right-hand side you can just ignore it
however if you have to specify or if you
don't want to specify a parameter that
comes initially or on the left-hand side
you need to specify it as undefined
now let's tweak our parameters let me
change bonus equal to 5 with bonus is
equal to value times 0.1 let me save
this and see what happens
okay so let me just comment this one we
don't need this anymore so how does this
work so value over here in our first
function there are no parameters
so it is going to assume value is equal
to 10 the default value and over here
bonus is equal to 10 times point 1 which
is 1 so 10 plus 1 11 there we go lemon
now when you specify a single argument
value is going to be 20 so 20 times 0.1
is 2 so 20 plus 2 is 22 and third one 20
comma 30 so it is going to take 20 and
30 so 50 nothing changes here so what I
wanted to point out here is that you can
take a value that is specified already
as a default value so value is on the
left hand side you can use this
parameter to specify a default value to
a parameter that occurs on the right
hand side so bonus equals value times
something now another thing is we can
also specify variables as assignments to
our panel eaters so let me change let
padlet percent bonus let percent bonus
and this is going to be equal to 0.1 and
we can change here with point 1 being
replaced by percent bonus so now let's
save this live in 1250 11 1250 it's
going to remain as it is and the next
thing is we can also specify a function
within this default so let me change
this to your function our functions
which we just learned so all this does
is takes no parameters and returns 0.1
so let me change percent bonus to a
function call and save this level 1250
11 12 15 so you can use variables while
assigning default values to parameters
and you can use functions when assigning
default values to parameters now what
about the arguments object
so let's console dot log
arguments dot lint
so let's save this and have a look at
our output concentrate on 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
over here for our gate value when we
don't specify a parameter arguments dot
length is 0 over here it is 1 over here
it is 2 so it only takes into
consideration the number of parameters
passed and it is going to ignore any
default values so default values are not
going to be considered as part of the
argument list only the parameter when
you call the function if you specify it
it is going to be present and finally
what we can do with default is assign a
value that is declared towards its right
side so I cannot assign bonus to value
so value is equal to bonus and this I
can just change it to 10 now this is not
going to work because there's no look
ahead so value does not know or at this
point of time we do not know what the
value of bonuses in hence we cannot
assign this to the parameter value so
that brings us to the end of this topic
