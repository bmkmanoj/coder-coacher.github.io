you're a complete beginner to web
development or you've got some
experience and want to know where you
can go next or you're an expert and
looking for what's trending in 2018 this
is the perfect video for you we are
going to take a look at the road map to
becoming a web developer in 2018 now
before we start let me mention a few
points this road map by no means covers
every technology out there in 2018 but
having said that it still covers a lot
you don't have to learn every technology
that I will list you can pick a path
either front-end or back-end if you
choose full stack you can again pick a
specific stack and focus only on that
now the options I've listed are based on
some research survey results and my
experience with some of the technologies
I'm pretty sure you guys might have some
opinions as well so if you feel there is
something that I have missed which is
worth mentioning leave a comment so that
everyone else can know what that is all
right then let's get started and I'm
gonna begin with the front end first we
all need to learn the basics HTML CSS
and JavaScript HTML is what gives
structure to your web page and CSS takes
care of the style and appearance it
doesn't matter if your web application
is simple or complex
they all need HTML and CSS they are the
foundation to web development and there
is no alternative
once you learn HTML and CSS you can
create static websites so the next step
is to learn JavaScript to add
interactivity
with JavaScript you can add or remove
HTML change Styles you can even listen
to user events suggest button clicks and
perform some action now once you master
the basics of JavaScript you can move on
to jQuery jQuery is a powerful
JavaScript library that lets you do a
lot with just a few lines of code now if
you notice this path has an orange color
and that is because in 2018 it is not
really required to learn jQuery don't
get me wrong it is great and a lot of
companies still use it but in 2018 this
is not a necessity so you can learn it
out of your own interest so once you
master these basics you dive deeper into
CSS and JavaScript let's take a look at
CSS first when it comes to CSS
frameworks there is bootstrap boma
foundation and materialize they all are
pretty great but my personal
recommendation is bootstrap bootstrap
for stable release should be out any
time soon and I would definitely
recommend getting started with that it
is built on top of flex box and has a
huge community behind it so definitely a
good choice next we have the
preprocessors basically the
pre-processors allow you to include
variables operators functions mix-ins
and so on with your regular CSS that is
then compiled down to the CSS that the
browser's can understand if you are
building complex projects then start
using preprocessors a couple of options
again we have sass less stylist and post
CSS I recommend going with sass or a CSS
to be more precise
then there is layout we have flexbox and
CSS grid the layout modules aim at
providing a more efficient way to layout
align and distribute the space among the
elements in a container even when their
size is unknown or can keep changing now
I recommend you get started with flexbox
because this also complements learning
bootstrap 4 and flex box is pretty
suitable for small components in your
application for building large layouts
you can start using CSS grid and finally
we have methodologies now CSS
methodologies are structured ways of
writing and organizing your CSS and HTML
if there are multiple people in a team
working on a project it's always a good
idea to adopt a standard convention for
writing HTML and CSS so there is
scalable and modular architecture for
CSS block element modifier and object
oriented CSS a couple more options out
there but I have listed these three
because they're kind of popular I have
no personal recommendation here because
it completely depends on the type of
project you work on but I can say that B
e/m is probably the more strict of the
three so that is about CSS now let's
talk about JavaScript once you learn the
basics of JavaScript you really must
learn es2015 also known as es6 yes 2015
is if I can call it modern JavaScript so
it's the JavaScript we know plus a whole
lot of new awesome features I highly
recommend you start using this in 2018
of course all browsers full
don't understand yes 2015 yet so you
need to transpile es2015 to the
JavaScript we know using something like
babel and once you have a good
understanding of es2015 you can move on
to typescript typescript is from
Microsoft and it is basically a typed
superset of JavaScript that again
compiles down to plain JavaScript so
typescript has all the features you see
in es2015 plus features from es2016
suggest decorators for example it also
provides optional static type checking
which is really helpful so definitely
get started with es 2015 and then if
possible move on to typescript if you
want to learn angular however typescript
is sort of a necessity next come task
runners there are a lot of tasks
involved with creating and deploying a
friend and application tasks like
watching file changes compiling
minifying files and linting javascript
so there are tools that take care of
this tools like gold and grunt if I had
to pick one I would pick go but heading
into 2018 I would say you might not even
require it a lot of the things you can
just as well do with NPM scripts but
again gold is probably amused in a lot
of companies right now so you can
definitely learn that as well then we
have the package managers that let you
manage the project dependencies and PM
is probably the most used package
manager but yarn is rapidly becoming
popular and is supposed to be a lot
faster than NPM so I would say get a
good understanding of both of them
next come the JavaScript frameworks now
let me tell you there are a lot more
frameworks than the ones I have
mentioned here but heading into 2018
angular react and view jeaious are
pretty much dominating so I could not
think of a reason why you might want to
consider a framework other than these
three out of the three I would say go
with react or UJS and the reason being
the learning curve for angular is much
more steep compared to the other two
don't get me wrong
angular is really powerful but I would
recommend learning angular after you've
learned either react or view and a plus
point with view is you can use plain
JavaScript or es5 and it is also a
progressive framework so you can use
view on only some parts of your
application or even build an entire
application from scratch so these are
some of the options for frameworks next
we have module loader or bundlers now
when you create your application you
probably divide the application into
modules and organize those modules into
different files and folders each of
those files has to be included in your
main HTML file in a script tag which is
then loaded by the browser having
separate references is obviously going
to take a toll on your page load time so
to get around this we bundle all our
files into one big file or fewer
separate files and then reference them
for this purpose we use tools like web
pack or browserify I would recommend
learning web pack because it has a few
more good features next a quick note on
testing when it comes to testing you can
pick mocha jasmine or car
based on the way you want to test your
application and a few more things on the
front end learn about Ajax or fetch API
for asynchronous functionality there is
charges or d3.js for data visualization
so if you want to build charge let's say
for analytics or a dashboard then you
can pick one of these after mastering
the basics start learning design
patterns and finally get a good hold of
using the browser developer tools I
would personally recommend using Chrome
and learning the chrome developer tools
because this will accelerate your
debugging process and you will get a
better understanding of the code you
write as you debug you can also get a
good understanding of your page
performance alright so that is about the
front-end now let's take a look at the
backend
I would say that back in is a different
animal altogether there is just so much
going on and they all are great in their
own way so let's begin with the
scripting languages these are basically
languages that don't need to be compiled
you've got Python nodejs Ruby and PHP
for each of them have listed the package
manager that you need to be aware of and
also a framework that you can get
started with for python you have pip
package manager and frameworks like
Django and flask nodejs you have NPM
package manager and Express framework to
get you started
similarly rubygems package manager for
ruby and frameworks like ruby on rails
and Sinatra PHP you have composer for
package management and frameworks like
laravel symphony and k PHP you can
probably get started with nodejs because
you might already know JavaScript which
you use for front-end so just start
using the same for back-end as well
no js' was also one of the commonly used
technologies in 2017 and I'm pretty sure
the same trend is going to carry forward
to 2018 next we have the compiled
languages c-sharp and Java have been in
use for quite a while now and you can
find a lot of companies that use C sharp
or Java you also have go and rust rust
was in fact the most loved programming
language in 2017 according to the Stack
Overflow survey so people who started
using rust wanted to continue using rust
so that's a good option to consider as
well now we come to the data in the
backend and let's start with storage
first we have the traditional RDBMS
so in relational database the data is
stored in tables that contain rows and
columns the tables may or may not have
relation between them to link the data a
couple of options here Microsoft sequel
server oracle mysql host press and maria
DB out of these my SQL is probably the
most popular one and something you can
pick as your first database as well but
then again certain databases go well
with certain technologies for example if
you're working with dotnet you can make
use of microsoft sequel server for PHP
you can use mine SQL and so on then we
also have the know sequel databases
where the data is not stored in tables
but rather as documents a lot of
advantages when it comes to no sequel
databases there is no fixed schema so
you can store different types of data in
the same collection easy to scale there
is no need of joints like you find in
our DBMS and a lot more
you've got MongoDB Cassandra firebase
which is a cloud database that has
become really popular if you start with
nodejs then definitely go with a no
sequel database MongoDB for example goes
really well with node.js and you can
also take a look at firebase it provides
a lot more than just data storage and
then on caching we have Redis and
memcache and search engines we have
solar and elasticsearch again these are
something to consider only after you
have made some good progress with the
basics and a few more things on the
backend take a look at web servers
engine X or Apache are pretty good learn
how to test the code you write
depending on the language you choose
learn how to test your code you can
learn things like an unit PHP unit by
unit mocha and so on learn how to handle
security and authorization learn about
authentication with oauth2 or JSON web
token learn how to create restful api is
with the language or framework you
choose optionally you can also learn
graph QL which is an alternate to rest
api s-- so instead of making multiple
requests graph QL allows you to make a
single request to get all the data you
want learn about the different
programming principles do not repeat
yourself you aren't gonna need it keep
it simple stupid and of course the solid
principles they definitely impact the
way you write your code also learn about
design patterns for example the Gang of
Four design patterns which are very
popular you can also take a look at
docker which helps you automate the
deployment of applications and a lot
more well that is about the back end
finally we come to mobile applications
some of you might already know but for
others who don't let me tell you we
can't develop mobile applications using
web technologies so once you get pretty
comfortable with a web technology you
can start building mobile applications
as well first we have ionic that lets
you build hybrid mobile applications so
it's just a web application that runs in
a mobile environment using Cordova this
uses angular so once you have a good
understanding of angular you can take a
look into ionic next we have react
native which is a framework that makes
use of react to build native mobile
applications we also have native script
which again is used to build
native mobile applications xamarin from
Microsoft which lets you build
cross-platform mobile applications
finally we have progressive web apps
something a lot of people are excited
about progressive web apps are regular
websites which can appear to the user
like native mobile applications there
are things like serviceworkers which
allow you to use a website when there is
poor or no network connectivity you can
also improve user engagement with push
notifications the users can just keep
the applications they find useful on the
home screen there is no need to install
them from the App Store a lot more
features but I'll leave it to you to
research but definitely heading into
2018 get an idea about pwace finally a
couple of things that you should know
irrespective of the path you take
learn to use git for version control
basic terminal usage SSH FTP and also
web hosting try to build a simple
website maybe your own portfolio and
then host it on the web
learn about HTTP and HTTPS get familiar
with a good text editor and by that I
mean installing all the extensions or
plugins that can really accelerate your
development time I would recommend
visual studio code finally make sure to
learn about JSON you're gonna use it in
front-end in the backend JSON is
basically everywhere it isn't something
hard to learn so just spend a day or two
and make yourself familiar with JSON
well with that we come to the end of our
road map two things have left out first
one CMS content management you can go
with WordPress which is pretty popular
the second thing is DevOps now DevOps is
where you need to learn so many
technologies and if I put it all out
here it can be quite intimidating so I
want to leave devups to those who really
are interested in taking that path get
good with some of the things mentioned
here and then research about DevOps
alright so that's pretty much what I
wanted to cover again if you guys think
I've left out something make sure to
leave a comment also let me know in the
comment section what tutorials are you
expecting to see in 2018 subscribe to
the channel and give this video a big
thumbs up if you found it helpful I wish
you all good luck for the year 2018</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
