released the results of their 2018
developer survey there were more than a
hundred thousand people who responded to
the survey and I feel it is really
important that all of us are aware of
these results because one it is pretty
reliable and two it gives you an insight
into what others are thinking some of us
might not have the time to go through
the full survey results so I've put
together the interesting and important
ones in this video I'll talk about the
developer profile first and then move on
to technology first let's talk about
developers experience when it comes to
experience one third of the people
started learning to code in the last
five years and over half of the
respondents have five years or less of
professional coding experience so you
can say that a majority of the people
have started out recently and it is
great to see the numbers grow every year
next let's talk about education about
three-fourths of professional developers
have the equivalent of a bachelor's
degree or higher so 20 to 25% of
professional developers do not have a
degree out of the professionals who do
have a degree nearly one-third majored
in a discipline other than computer
science or software engineering so how
are they learning mainly through
official documentation Stack Overflow
ebooks and online courses in fact 80% of
respondents rely on Stack Overflow Q &amp;amp; A
when learning something new so the next
time you want to learn a new language
make sure you keep this in mind next
let's talk about employment over 90% of
developers are employed at least
part-time 74% are in fact employed
full-time this is a really good number
to see
for those as fighting to be developers
in the future keep trying hard and
you're going to find the job you always
wanted all right now let's focus on
technology for the sixth year in a row
javascript is the most commonly used
programming language Python has risen in
the ranks surpassing c-sharp this year
it is rapidly growing as a major
programming language so if you've just
started using Python this should make
you happy now diving into frameworks and
libraries nodejs and angular continue to
be the most commonly used technologies
with react and dotnet core shortly
behind when it comes to databases MySQL
and sequel server continue to be the top
two most commonly used databases MongoDB
is the most popular no sequel database
next up let's take a look at the most
loved and wanted results for the third
year in a row rust is the most loved
programming language followed closely by
Courtland
this means that proportionally more
developers want to continue working with
these than other languages and Python is
the most wanted language for the second
year in a row if I wanted it is not what
the companies are looking for but it is
the language that developers who do not
yet use it want to learn when it comes
to frameworks and libraries tensorflow
the machine learning framework is the
most loved one by developers and react
is the framework developers say they
most want to work with databases for the
second year in a row Redis is the most
loved database MongoDB is the most
wanted database finally when it comes to
environment and tools specifically for
web development Visual Studio code top
the list edging out Visual Studio for
the very first time so we have Visual
Studio code
by Visual Studio followed by notepad and
sublime if you haven't used it already I
highly recommend you start using Visual
Studio code alright that's pretty much
what I wanted to cover there is a lot
more information such as how many hours
you spend on your laptop do you exercise
at all do you skip any of your meals
what time do you wake up and also for
the very first time there is survey
result on how ethical a developer is and
also about artificial intelligence but
this channel is mainly focused on web
development and I wanted to give an
overview focusing on that I have the
link to the survey in the description
down below so if you do have the time
feel free to go through the entire
survey well that's pretty much it thank
you guys for watching and don't forget
to subscribe for more videos on web
development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
