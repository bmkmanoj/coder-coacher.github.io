look at how to insert documents into a
database now there are two ways you can
insert the first one as inserting
documents one at a time and the second
one is inserting multiple documents
through an array now let's consider an
example of a company database so let us
create a database called company views
company now we have switch to DB company
and let us insert documents and do this
database now the command is de dodd
collection name so let us say we have a
collection of employees employees dot
insert now the data in MongoDB are the
documents usually contain data in JSON
format so I have a sample JSON file then
I'm gonna be using for the rest of the
tutorials and I'm gonna be dropping a
link to this in the description so let
us say we have a document regarding one
employee related to one employee and we
want to insert that into a database so
go back Dvina insert and just paste this
so just select everything control shift
enter okay so I need to select these
alright control shift enter and right
wrist on this one so we were able to
insert one document into our database
now what if we don't want to insert one
by one by one and we want to insert at
bulk so we can do that using the array
so the command remains the same DVD
collection named insert but inside just
add square brackets and all the date
that goes in between
so suppose we need to enter the rest of
the data rest of the documents copy
everything select it go back
paste it now one thing to notice is that
each document has to be separated by a
comma and at the very end the last
document does not contain a coma they're
selling this command and control shift
enter and we see that seven documents
were inserted into the database so
that's how you create documents and
insert them into the database thank you
