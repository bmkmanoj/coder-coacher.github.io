be learning about iterables and
iterators so es2015 introduces iteration
which is a new way to traverse data and
iteration revolves around two key
concepts namely iterables and iterators
so let's try to understand water
iterables
and water iterators now an iterable is
any object that implements a method
whose key is symbol dot iterator so we
will have an interval which is nothing
but an object which has @ symbol dot
property symbol dot iterator method and
this method is going to return an
iterator
iterator but what is an iterator an
iterator is an object that is going to
implement a next method so it is going
to have a next method and this next
method knows how to access elements in a
collection be it an array or a string or
maps or sets and it is it returns an
object let's call this iterator result
object and this iterator result object
is nothing but an object that contains
two properties so let me copy this and
the first property is a value property
and this can be of any data type so this
value is going to be the actual value
within the collection and the second
property is a boolean flag called done
so this done indicates if the iteration
is complete or not complete so if done
is true the iteration is complete
if it is false there are more elements
to be iterated over so as I already
mentioned in es2015 array strings maps
and sets are all iterables but to
understand better about iterators let's
create our own iterator that works with
arrays so
just comment this code over here and
let's go over here and let's create a
new area and call this iterable and this
is going to create contain 1 comma 2
comma 3 ok and let's create our iterator
now it's going to be a function and
let's name it create iterator and this
is going to accept an array and let's
have a count variable that we used to
iterate or keep track of each element
within the array and if you see over
here an iterator this contains a next
method so it's going to return something
and that is a next method so this next
is going to be a function and it's going
to return this result object now there
are two conditions while returning this
object if the count of the array or the
count current count is less than array
dot length then we are going to return
okay let's I'm going to move this into
the next line so the value is going to
be array of count but we also need to
move on to the next element so count
plus plus and done is going to be false
so the count is less than array array
length which means to say that we have
more elements that need to be iterated
so we are not yet done with the
iteration and if if the count is equal
to or greater than ally dot length that
means we have hit the end of our
iteration so we are going to be
returning value undefined
and done
true so now let me create let my
iterator and assign it to this function
so create iterator and pass the iterable
array so now we have a reference to this
function and by making use of the next
method we can iterate through each of
these elements so console dot log my
iterator dot next so now when I save
this and head over to the browser it's
going to say object value is one and
done as false so the first element now
if I repeat this two more times let's
save this and we get value two three and
we are not yet done with the iteration
and finally when we call this again and
save this we get value undefined and we
are done with the iteration of this
functionality in fact is what the
far-off loop uses it internally calls
the next method until this done is true
so until the iteration is completed it
keeps calling this next method and that
is how it iterates through the elements
of a collection so now I hope you are
able to better relate symbol dot
iterator with iterators and iterables
and iterators with the for off loop a
for off loop can work if it knows how to
use the iterator so that's pretty much
it for this video in the next video let
us see how to iterate our objects
because it is not built-in to the
language so thank you guys for watching
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
