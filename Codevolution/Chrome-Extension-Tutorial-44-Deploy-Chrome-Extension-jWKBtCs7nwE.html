our extension to the Chrome Web Store so
how do we do that go to google and
search for chrome dashboard and click on
this first link now it's going to ask
you to log in and once you log in you'll
be presented with this particular web
page now of course you won't have these
listings but you will have this content
and the only thing that I would
recommend you to change initially it's
just this developer display name now
I've changed the code evolution and this
is basically what it shows here in the
webstore and if you notice I have left
the other things as it is now to publish
your extension click on add new item and
this is going to say upload an extension
or an application and it says that
upload a zip file of your item directory
and not a packaged CRX file so let's zip
one of our folders one of our extensions
let's say hello world I'm going to zip
this and now once I have the zipped file
I can upload it so choose file and hello
world when I click on open and it is
going to basically upload that zipped
file I'm going to click on upload all
right so once the upload is done once
the uploading is done it is going to
take us to the next page where we have
to specify certain details about our
extension now the first thing you need
to fill out is the detailed description
and this is basically what you are going
to see here when someone clicks on your
extension in the Chrome Web Store
the next thing I con so upload a proper
icon so that it gets displayed over here
and the Chrome Web Store and then
screenshots now try to provide as much
screenshots as possible that illustrate
the functionality of your extension for
example I have three screenshots for
wicked the first one is I'm selecting
some text the second one I'm just right
clicking on am selecting wicked context
menu and finally it takes me to the
Wikipedia page of antiproton decelerator
alright the next
is about promotion I'm not gonna go
about that if you want to you can upload
some images and anything to do regarding
your website I can decide not mandatory
you can specify a category for your
extension excuse me
so developer tools fun news and weather
photos whatever suits your extension now
pricing and payments I'm going to leave
it as free and the regions where your
extension is available so you might want
to leave them all selected and some of
the other options so these are not
really mandatory so I'm not gonna go
over them to be honest analytics if you
want to track analytics of your
extension and visibility options so it's
public and all that so again I would
recommend you to only fill in for your
initial extension the detailed
description and icon some screenshots
and the category so everything else you
can leave it as it is and when you click
on preview changes over here it is
basically going to show how your
extension is going to look in the Chrome
Web Store now of course I have not
uploaded any icon or any of the
screenshots or a description so this is
how it's going to show up but again once
you fill all the details it's going to
be different so let me return to the
dashboard and yeah that's it and if I
say if I go to edit and let's say you
make a revision to your extension then
you can upload that updated package over
here so you can change the version to
1.1 1.2 2.0 in the manifest and then
upload the updated package so that is
how you basically deploy a Chrome
extension into the webstore</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
