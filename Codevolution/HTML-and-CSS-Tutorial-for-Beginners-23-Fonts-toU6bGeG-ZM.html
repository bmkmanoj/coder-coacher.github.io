we are going to be learning about font
properties in CSS now so far we have
been hanging only one fond throughout or
HTML document and to specify a font we
need to use a font family property of
CSS so let's say we want to change the
font of our paragraph tag so let me
quickly create a paragraph tag this is
some text all right when you go ahead
and refresh it all right it has some
default font now in our style tag let's
create a style for our paragraph tag so
the property we use is font family and
this can take a valid font as its value
let's say Georgia now when we save it
notice the difference in the in the font
so refresh and there you go it's kind of
a bigger font and generally it's a good
idea to specify multiple phones so that
if one of them is not supported it then
goes or relies on the next one so let's
say surf so what happens here is that
first it checks the georgia is a valid
font then it uses georgia if that is not
supported it then goes back to donna and
even if that has not supported it
changes to serif font so for example let
me just mess up the spelling so that
georgia is not valid then it relies on
where Donna if i refresh it there you go
it's even bigger font so that's how the
font family probably works you need to
specify fonts as the values and it's
going to use one of them whichever is
supported and in the order from left to
right and the next property we have is
font style now font style this font
style can be used to let's say make our
prop maker element
it tells sized so if you use the font
style of italics and if you refresh it
the text becomes italicized now there is
another value which is oblique so
oblique and save it then reload it so I
don't really find that much of a
difference but it does exist end it is
it I have to explain that to you so a
fun style can either be italicized or
oblique and next we have a font size
property so font size and this well
obviously is used to set the size of the
font so let's say 24 pixels when you
save it and reload it it becomes bigger
the size is now 24 pixels if you make it
let's say 36 and reload it and becomes
even bigger and lastly we have font
weight now the font weight probably is
used to specify how thick you want the
text to be now there's a difference
between size and weight size is the
actual size but wait is just the
thickness of individual letters so let
me show you what I mean one of the
possible values is lighter now when we
save it just observe the thickness of
each of the letters okay I did not save
it refresh all right let me make it
bolder so you can make out the
difference the boulder is another value
that font weight takes all right there
you go the size of the font still
remains the same but the thickness of
the letters is going to be increasing
and we can have something like normal
which is the actual size or the
thickness what we have then we also have
bold so save it refresh it
it becomes bold the possible values are
normal lighter bold and bolder and let's
pretty much it about the font properties
in CSS we have a font family to specify
the font we want to use we have a font
style that can be used to italicize or
make the text oblique and then we have a
font size to specify the size and the
font way to specify the thickness of the
text so thank you guys for watching
don't feel shy and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
