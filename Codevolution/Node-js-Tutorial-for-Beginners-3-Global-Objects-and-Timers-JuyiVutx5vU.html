have objects that can be used directly
in our application and those objects are
called global objects let's have a look
at few examples to understand some of
the global objects and functions the
first one is double underscore file name
now this represents the file name of the
code being executed so if I just wrap it
around a console dot log add a semicolon
save it and then open open command
prompt here and let's say node AB dogger
s now this gives this represents the
file name so we have the entire
directory to where a file resides and
then the name of the file which is AB
dot yes similarly we have a double
underscore dir n am E so console dot log
double underscore dir n am E and you
guessed it this is going to print out or
it's going to represent the directory of
the file under execution so node address
this time we have the directory and now
the file name so the double underscore
file name represents the file under
execution and the double underscore dir
name represents the directory of where
the file is being executed now the next
one is a function or global function
called
timeout so set timeout now what this
does is it is going to accept two
parameters the first one is a function
so let's say we have let's create a
function first so we have function grant
stuff
and let's say it just types out its just
prints in a lock console this was from
said time out
and in a third timers function our first
parameter is going to be a function so
friends stuff and the second parameter
is going to represent time and
milliseconds so if I say 5000 and means
five thousand milliseconds or five
seconds and set timeout is going to call
this function print stuff after five
seconds so if you save this given a
command prompt and say you know dab
dodge as 1 2 3 4 5 so this was from said
timeout
so our set timeout is going to call
printf function which is going to print
this was from set timeout and it is
going to be called up to 5 seconds
pretty cool right now if you want to if
you want a function to be executed at
regular intervals of time then we're
going to be using a global function
called set interval now once again this
takes a function so print stuff and then
takes time and milliseconds so let's say
2000 now if we save it go back to our
alright let's just remove this so that
we don't get confused and this was from
set interval so save it go to your
command prompt and run no chess no nap
one two this one one two one two
so what set interval does is it is going
to call our function print stuff after
every two seconds if I hit control-c
it's going to stop the execution anyway
to summarize what we learnt in this
video
we use double underscore file name that
represents the file name under execution
we used double underscore
dir and ami to get the the directory
name of the script under execution then
we used a global function called set
timeout that can be used to call a
certain function after after a certain
amount of time and we also had a look at
the set interval global function that is
used to repeatedly call a function after
a fixed interval of time so thank you
guys for watching and in the next video
we are going to have a look at callback
functions thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
