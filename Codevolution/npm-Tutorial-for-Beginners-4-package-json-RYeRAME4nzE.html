are going to include a file called
package.json in our project folder and
using a package.json file has two main
benefits the first thing is that it lets
you manage the dependencies of your
project for example if I am working on
an old project that makes use of the
Express framework then I can specify the
Express package and the version of
Express that my project depends on and
the second thing is that it lets you add
scripts that help with initial build of
your project now in this video let us
see how to create a package.json file
and learn about managing dependencies
and using scripts in the later videos
and we don't have to manually type the
package dot JSON file instead we can use
the npm init command now I have created
a new folder called NPM on my desktop
and open the command prompt in the same
folder and over here I'm going to type
NPM in it and this is going to ask you a
series of questions but the good thing
is that NPM gives you a default answer
to every question so for now I'm just
going to hit enter for everything and
once you hit enter for all the questions
it is going to give you a preview of how
the package dot JSON file is going to
look and now if I press ENTER it is
going to create that package dot JSON
file in my NPM folder and if I open this
with an editor you can have a look at
the contents we have a name a version a
description which is the main file some
scripts an author and the license now if
you want to create a package dot JSON
file with these defaults we can just use
the - - yes option to skip through the
questions so I'm going to delete this
file so let's see delete and then
go back to command prompt and type NPM
and net - - yes and now without having
to answer any of the questions it is
going to create that exact same package
JSON file so if I have a look here the
contents remain the same and there you
go
that is how you create a package JSON
file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
