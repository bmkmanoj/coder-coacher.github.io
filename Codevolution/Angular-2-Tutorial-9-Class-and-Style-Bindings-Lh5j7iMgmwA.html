are going to be learning how to bind
classes and styles to HTML element first
let us create a new class so after the
template configuration let's use tiles
and create a new class so back tags
let's name the class my class and let's
just assign it a color red okay so what
class binding does is it it is going to
assign a class to an HTML element based
on an expression which evaluates to be
true or false so to understand that
let's create a div tag so open and close
let's just have some content let's say
apply class okay now to apply class
binding we make use of the class
property serve class within square
brackets and we use a dot followed by it
the class that we want to apply or not
apply based on the condition so here the
class we want to apply is my class now
this is going to be assigned the class
is going to be assigned to the div tag
based on the truth or falsity of a
variable so let's create a variable or a
property so public let's say apply class
is equal to true now if we specify
applied class over here it is going to
check if apply class is true or false if
it is true it is going to take my class
the styles in my class and apply it to
the div tag so when we save this and go
to our browser it says apply class and
red color so that's how class binding
works similarly we have style binding in
order to apply inline style to HTML
element so let's say
let's create another property so public
apply red let's go with blue apply blue
is equal to true now let's create
another div tag so do do and this is
style binding okay so in order to
specify inline styles using style
binding we're going to be making use of
square brackets again and we are going
to say style dot let's try to manipulate
the color so a color will be equal to an
expression so let's say apply blue so
applied blue now we're going to be using
the operator which is going to work like
an a false condition
so it's apply blue true then color is
going to be blue if it is false
let us assign it an orange color now
when you save this and reload it you see
that this a style binding is in blue
color because the apply blue is true so
this is true and apply blue so let's say
we change it to both of them defaults
okay now when you save it the red and
the blue get changed to no style for the
first one since we are not applying the
class anymore and orange color for the
style binding because we have specified
that if apply blue is false the color
will be orange so this is just a small
topic on class binding and style binding
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
