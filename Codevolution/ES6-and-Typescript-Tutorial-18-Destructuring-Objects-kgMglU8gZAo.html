we are going to learn how to destruct
your objects in es2015 now in the last
video we learned how to be structure
this employee array now in this video
I'm going to use the same example to
help us understand how to restructure
objects so we have the employee array
which I'm their being female so I'm
going to start off by converting that
into an object so let employee there's
going to be an object first name is
going to be Chandler and then we'll have
last name which is going to be Bing and
they will have gender which is going to
be male and in the previous video we
learned that we need to use the square
brackets and the variables within that
2d structure this employee array now 2d
structure this employee object we need
to use curly braces instead of square
brackets so we can have let me comment
this out we're going to have lead within
curly braces we need to specify the
variable names and we have to ensure
that the property name is the same as
this variable name so we need to have F
name L name and gender and this is going
to be equal to employee now let's save
this and in our browser we have Chandler
Bing and male so we have big structure
this employee object by taking these
individual property values and assigning
them to the variables now let's say our
property name is huge and so we don't
want to use such a variable name
throughout in our code for example let's
say this was this probably was 20
characters in length and we have to use
that variable multiple times in our code
so in such a case what we do is we can
create an alias so first name I'm going
to put a colon and F last name I'm going
to put a colon and L gender I'm going to
put a colon and G so what do you base
doing is creating an alias for this
first name last name and gender but now
we cannot use this first name last name
gender anymore
we have to use the alias so f name is
going to be just F L name just L and
gender just G so let's save this and
there you go
Chandler Bing and male so that's pretty
much how you the structure objects you
have an object and then you use the
curly braces and assign it to the object
and each property name should match the
variable name and then the value will
get assigned to it now if you want you
can also create an alias for each of
these variable names but you have to
make sure that you own that you use only
these variable names so console dot log
F L and G so that's pretty much it about
destructuring
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
