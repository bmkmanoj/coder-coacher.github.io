server be it get post put or delete the
server needs to interact with MongoDB to
perform the required operation and for
this interaction we make use of Mongoose
Mongoose is just another NPM package
that provides MongoDB object mapping or
in simpler words Mongoose translates the
data in the database to a JavaScript
object for use in our application there
are alternatives like Mongo Jas and
native Mongo client but Mongoose is
quite simple once you understand how it
works so to install Mongoose package go
back to visual SRIA code in the terminal
within the server folder type the
command npm install - - save Mongoose
now if you remember I just mentioned
that data or a document in MongoDB is
represented as a JavaScript object so
first we need to have a blueprint or a
schema of that object so in the server
folder create another folder and name it
models within the models folder create a
file called user dot J's and within this
file first require mongus that was just
installed next get an instance of the
manga schema const schema is equal to
Mongoose dot schema the next step create
a new schema for the user data in
MongoDB Const user schema is going to be
a new schema and the user schema is
going to have an email of type string
and the password of type string again
next create a model from the schema and
export it so module dot export is equal
to Mongoose dot model we're going to
call this model user the schema is going
to be user schema and then the
collection in the database is going to
be the users collection that we created
in the last video in M lab so now I have
a mongoose model that can be used to
create read update and delete documents
in the database
the only remaining task is to connect to
the database that has been created now
all database requests are going to be
managed in the API route so the database
connection happens in the API dot JS
file
let's begin by requiring Mongoose
and then declaring the connection string
to the database
and what is the connection string we
need to find that out from em lab so go
back to em lab and for the database
events DB they provide the connection
string so you can see that to connect
using a driver via the standard MongoDB
you are right we need to use this
connection string so copy it and then go
back to visuals for your code and paste
it now instead of the DB user I'm going
to fill in user Vishwas this was the
user that we created for the database
and again the password for the user
this was password which was the next
step let's connect to the database so
Mongoose dot connect the first argument
is the database string so DB and then
the second argument is a callback
function the callback function is going
to give an error if the connection was
not successful so if there was an error
I'm going to log that to the console so
console dot error if there was no error
then we are going to log to the console
connected to MongoDB so if I restart the
server now note server
if the connection was successful you
should see the message connected to
MongoDB alright now that the connection
has been established with the database I
will show you how to code the restful
api s and also test them using postman
so thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
