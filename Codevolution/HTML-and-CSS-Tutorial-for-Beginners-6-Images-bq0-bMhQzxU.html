six of the HTML CSS series and in this
video we are going to be learning how to
add images to your webpages now we can
insert any image and our website using
the image tag so let's say we want to
insert an image after this horizontal
line so open I M G and then the image is
an empty element so a front slash and
then the closing tag no image always
takes an attribute called source now
what exactly is an attribute let's say
someone asks you to describe your best
friend then you say well his name is
Joey and his average height and has
black hair now these are the
characteristics of your friend and
similarly excuse me the attribute of an
HTML element that's nothing but the
extra characteristics of your HTML
element now the image takes an attribute
called source which needs the path where
the image is stored so the attributes
are usually a name and a value pair so
the attribute name is source and then
the value is the path where the image
exists and I have an image called
friends and the same folder as the index
dot HTML
I can type friends dot jpg there's also
a second attribute called alt which is
equal which is used to specify some text
in case the browser is not able to load
the image so this is friend's image now
when we go ahead and save it and reload
it then we have an awesome image of
friends now we can also specify the
height and width of the image and that
can be done using the height and width
at
so let's specify weight is equal to
let's say 150 pixels on 50 pixels and
then height is equal to 100 pixels so
when we save it go back and reload it
then we have an image which is 150
pixels wide and 100 pixels in height now
a better way to specify the width and
height is to use them and the style
attribute so instead we are going to be
making use of another attribute called
style and this is equal to the first one
this width and then you specify : and
then say 500 pixel and then put a
semicolon and then height is going to be
let's say 250 pixel then when we save it
and reload reloaded we say we have a
image which is 500 pixels wide and 250
pixels tall so that's pretty much it
about images we use the image tag to
insert an image onto your web page it
has a source attribute which is used to
specify where the image exists we have
an alt attribute to specify some text in
case the image failed to be loaded and
we use the style attribute to specify
the width and height of our image and
there we go
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
