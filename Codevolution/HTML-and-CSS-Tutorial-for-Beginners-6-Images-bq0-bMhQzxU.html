six of the HTML CSS series and in this
video we are going to be learning how to
add images to your web pages now we can
insert any image in our website using
the image tag let's say we want to
insert an image after this horizontal
line so open I mg and then now image is
an empty element so a front slash and
then the closing tag no image always
takes an attribute called source now
what exactly is an attribute let's say
someone asks you to describe your best
friend then you say well his name is
Joey and his average height and has
black hair now these are the
characteristics of your friend and
similarly excuse me the attribute of an
HTML element is nothing but the extra
characteristics of your HTML element now
the image takes an attribute called
source which needs the path where the
image is stored so the attributes are
usually a name and a value pair so the
attribute name is source and then the
value is the path where the image exists
and I have an image called friends and
the same folder as the index dot HTML I
can type rent dot CP g there's also a
second attribute called old which is
equal which is used to specify some text
in case the browser is not able to load
the image so this is friends image now
when we go ahead and save it and reload
it then we have an awesome image or
friends now we can also specify the
height and width of the image and that
can be done using the height and width
add
you'd so let's specify weight is equal
to let's say 150 pixels on 50 pixels and
then height is equal to 100 pixels so
when we save it go back and reload it
then we have an image which is 150
pixels wide and 100 pixels in height now
a better way to specify the width and
height is to use them and the style
attribute so instead we are going to be
making use of another attribute called
style and this is equal to the first one
is ripped and then you specify colon and
then save 500 pixel and then put a
semicolon and then height shooting is
going to be let's say 250 pixel now when
we save it and reload reload it we say
we have a image which is 500 pixels wide
and 250 pixels tall so that's pretty
much it about images we use the image
tag to insert an image onto your webpage
it has a source attribute which is used
to specify where the image exists we
have an alt attribute to specify some
text in case the image failed to be
loaded and we use the style attribute to
specify the width and height of our
image and there we go thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
