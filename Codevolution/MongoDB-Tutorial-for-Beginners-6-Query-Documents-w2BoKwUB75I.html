tutorials we had seen how to insert
documents into collections which are
present in a database now in this video
let us have a look at how to retrieve
those documents so we have the database
called company and in company we have
the collections collection called
employees and we have documents inside
employees now let's see how to retrieve
this document now the command to
retrieve documents is DB dot employees
which is the collection name dot find
and that's it so when you execute the
command you get the list of documents
now one thing sorry two things to point
out though the first one is whenever you
insert a document in the MongoDB it is
ultimately going to insert this field
called object ID so this MongoDB is way
of uniquely identifying a document so if
you do not specify this field is going
to insert one on its own if you do then
it's going to take that value now the
second thing is employee star to find
just actually retrieve data and
following structured format it's
actually going to be in a different way
let me show you how so let's get back to
a command prompt I have typed Mongo I'm
in the Mongo shell I'm gonna type DB dot
employees sorry and boy you start find
so this is how data or the document is
generally retrieved when you just use DB
dot employees are defined if you want
the data in a structured format then
what you want to do is DV dot employees
dot find don't pretty that's right
MongoDB provides a pretty command so
when you execute that you get the data
or the document and structured way now
the next command is suppose we want to
retrieve just one document
from the collection then the command is
DB dot employees dot find one so when
you do that long buddy we retrieves just
one document for you and employee IDs
once it is the first document in the
collection now find one doesn't have a
pretty but to find does find one already
has two prettier format when you execute
it now let us look at how to retrieve or
create documents based on certain
conditions now the first one is equality
condition now suppose we want to
retrieve employee whose employee number
is two let's see how to do that the
command is DV dot collection employees
don't find now this time fine takes a
parameter so flower brackets and we want
the employee number employee number to
be equal to two so when we execute the
following command we get the employee
who's my number is two the document
related to employee number do now what
if you want say we want to retrieve the
data of all employees who have aged less
than 30 studio that employee number is
age and we have to specify dollar LT so
LT stands for less than and we say 30 so
this means that find all the employees
here on H less than 30 an employee's
collection so when you go ahead and
execute that we get two documents
and both of them have an H less than 30
27 and 26 suppose if you want to
retrieve employee data of each less than
or equal to 30 just add dollar LTE less
than or equal to 30
and then run it so we have 30 we are 27
and we have 26 similarly if you want to
retrieve employee data who have age
greater than 30 then Chitti which stands
for greater than 30 just execute that
and we have age just to verify here just
age is 40 30 to 45 33 36 and if you want
to add the Equality greater non-it
greater than or equal to 30 then just
dollar gde
and control shift enter and we have 30
along with the rest of the age now the
last condition would be not equal to
suppose we want to retrieve all
employees who are off not age 30
then just say dollar and II and run this
so we had 27 40 30 to 45 33 36 26 so
this is how you retrieve documents from
a database you use the find method to
retrieve the documents and you add the
pretty command to get it in a more
structured way and if you want to
retrieve just one document we use to
find one command and if you want to
select documents based on some condition
we can pass it as a parameter and the
find method so thank you for watching
