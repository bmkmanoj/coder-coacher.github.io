our extension in the context menu and
the creation of the context menu is very
similar to what we saw in the budget
manager extension so we are going to
start off with a menu item so menu item
is equal to this going to be an object
we're going to have an ID for this menu
item this is going to be wicked then we
can have a title this is what is going
to appear when you right click so title
is going to be wicked with an uppercase
W and then we can have the contexts so
well - we have one this menu item - up
here when there is a selection all right
now that we have our menu item we can
use the chrome API chrome dot context
menus dot create and pass this menu item
so many item right now the next thing is
I'm going to copy/paste a function fixed
and code URI and what this does is any
text you select it is going to prepare
it in a format that can be appended to a
URL for example we cannot we cannot have
blank spaces or some special characters
and this function right here is going to
take care of that so now we can go ahead
and listen when a user clicks on our
context menu item so chrome dot context
menus dot on clicked dot add listener so
again there's something we are already
done and we are just going to go through
it again
so click data is what it gives us and we
check if click data a dot menu item ID
equals equals wicket so the ID of our
menu item and we need to check if there
is some selection so click data dot
selection text so once we have this
ready we can prepare our URL so are we
keep URL is equal to now if you head
over to Wikipedia
this right here is going to be the
constant and polymer is the search term
so I'm going to paste this and then
append so Plus this is going to be fixed
code URI and we pass in this selection
text so click data dot selection text
and I hope you can see that all right
now that we have the selection text we
can create a new window with this URL so
war create data is equal to is going to
be an object we specify the URL and this
URL is nothing but the wiki URL we just
created and then we can have type so
this is going to be a pop-up window so
hop up and then we're going to specify
the positioning from top it's going to
be 5 and from the left it is going to be
5 again then we can also specify a width
and a height so red is going to be lets
say screen dot available but so a well
bit by 2 and then we are also going to
have the height H TIG HT and this is
going to be screen dot avail height by 2
so this is basically going to select a
quadrant of the available screen width
so once we have this we can just use
chrome dot windows dot create we can
specify this create data and then I
believe it needs a callback function but
for now let's just leave it empty all
right our extension is ready believe it
or not I think we did it in under 10 to
15 minutes so anyway let's load this and
see how it works so I'm going to
extensions load unpacked extensions
I have wicked I selected and I have
wicked over here with the icon right now
if you have a look
as grayed out and let me go over here
I'm going to close this so what was the
word polymeric so I'm gonna right click
and I get this option called
wicked and when I click on that it's
basically going to open a small window
basically one-fourth the screen width
and it's going to give me the same
information so about polymers so I can
read whatever I want to and then just
close it and if I want another word
let's say aggregate I can say wicked I
can read about that and there we go a
very simple extension and I think a some
I think some of you might find it useful
but I got to warn you though a very
similar extension but but even better
functionality already exists in the
chrome store but anyway this is
something you have created right so
there you go or wicked extension all
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
