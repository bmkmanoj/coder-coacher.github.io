to learn about interpolation now to get
us started I've created a new project
called
binding and within the project I have
generated a new component called test
component
I have also simplified the HTML in the
app component so this displays just from
app component in an h1 tag and in the
test component I've moved the template
inline so it's in the same typescript
file and the template just displays
welcome Bishwas
so if you save the project and run it
the template is displayed in the browser
from app component which is from the app
component dot HTML file and then welcome
vishwas from the test component
typescript file
alright now if you take a look at the
code the name vishwas is static so the
message will always be welcome vishwas
but what we want is the name to be
dynamic
for example we greet the user that is
currently logged in now the name may
come from a web service or a web api but
the bottom line is the value may change
at any point of time so for that what we
do is create a new property in the class
and let's call it name and assign it the
string which was so public name is equal
to vishwas
now how do we get this value into our
template the answer is double curly
braces so instead of vishwas we use
double curly braces and then inside the
braces we specify the property in our
case it is the main property and this
syntax of a property or an expression
within double curly braces is known as
interpolation in angular by using
interpolation we are asking angular to
evaluate the content inside the curly
braces and display the value when the
component is rendered in the browser so
if we save this and refresh the browser
you can still see welcome vishwas but
this time the name comes from a class
property and is not static
so for example if I change the name to
code evolution the browser updates and
we can see welcome code evolution of
course right now I am changing the name
property manually but in a practical
application the name can get its value
from a variety of sources so this is
interpolation which is the simplest way
to bind data from a class to the
template all right now let's take a look
at some more examples to fully
understand what interpolation can and
cannot do all right now close the
Explorer and also the app component HTML
because the test component types grid
file is the only thing that we are going
to be working with for the next couple
of videos all right back to
interpolation now the first example is
about expressions so I'm going to add a
new h2 tag and I will be using it to tag
only for visibility in the browser and
within the h2 tag we can type within
double curly braces two plus two now
what happens is angular evaluates the
expression and displays the result in
the browser so if we go back to the
browser you can see four which is two
plus two similarly you can perform a
string concatenation as well so I'm
gonna add another h2 tag and within
double curly braces this time I'm going
to say within a pair of double quotes
welcome and then concatenate it with the
name so it is going to be welcome
followed by the name which is code
evolution so if we head back to the
browser you can see welcome code
evolution so this is a result of string
concatenation angular will replace the
value for the name property and then
concatenate it with welcome string to
display welcome code evolution in the
browser now the next example is using
javascript properties and methods within
the curly braces so for example I can
have another h2 tag and then over here
I'm going to have double curly braces
and I'm going to type name dot length so
this will display the length of the
string code evolution which is 12 and in
the browser you can see 12 being
displayed similarly we can also use
methods for example I can have another
h2 tag and over here within double curly
braces we can have name dot to uppercase
and now the name will be displayed in
uppercase in the browser so code
evolution in uppercase apart from the
built-in javascript methods you can also
call methods define in the component
class for example let's create a new
method I'm going to call this greet user
and then we are going to return hello
concatenated with the name so this dot
name which represents this name property
code evolution now back in the template
we can call this method so I'm going to
add a new h2 tag and within double curly
braces I can call greet user now if we
go back to the browser you can see Hello
code evolution is rendered so these are
some of the things you can do with
interpolation but what are some of the
things you cannot do now the first one
is assigning the expression to a
variable so for example let me create a
new h2 tag and within double curly
braces if you try a is equal to 2 plus 2
and head over to the browser we have a
problem
rendering the HTML and if you take a
look at the console you can see that we
have a parse error template parts error
bindings cannot contain assignments so
you cannot assign the result of an
expression to a variable within double
curly braces so assignments are not
possible now another limitation is the
access to global variables such as
window screen and so on so if you try to
find out the URL of the current page
using window dot location dot H ref you
get
ever cannot read property location of
undefined so the template is not aware
of the global JavaScript variables now
if you do need to access them however
you can do it in the class and then bind
it to the template so for example I can
create a new property let's call this
public site URL is equal to window dot
location dot H ref and then in the
template we can bind this site URL so
site URL now if we go back to the
browser you can see HTTP localhost 4200
all right just to quickly summarize what
we have learned so far with
interpolation you can bind data from the
class to the template and the syntax is
double curly braces and within the
double curly braces you have a property
or an expression so you can evaluate any
JavaScript expression and the result
will be displayed in the browser you can
also perform string concatenation you
can use JavaScript properties and
methods as well you can even call
methods that you have defined in the
components class within interpolation
however you cannot perform assignments
or access global JavaScript variables
with interpolation all right that's
pretty much it about interpolation thank
