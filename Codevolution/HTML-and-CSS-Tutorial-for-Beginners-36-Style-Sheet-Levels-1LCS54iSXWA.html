we are going to be learning about the
different levels of style sheets or in
other terms the different ways then we
can specify styles for the HTML element
now there are actually three different
ways by which we can specify the style
the first one is called an inline style
sheet the second one is called a
document level style sheet and finally
an external style sheet now if you go
through some other tutorials you
probably would have encountered this at
the very beginning but I want to take a
different approach and first teach you
the different styles that can be applied
and then learn the different ways of
applying the style so anyway let's get
started and i'm going to pick document
level style sheet first anyway let me
create ok the first one is the first one
is in line style sheet the second one
has document level style sheet and the
third one is external style sheet
alright so first i'm going to be
teaching you guys document level style
sheet because this is what we've been
using all along so the document level
style sheet usually has a style tag in
the headers in the head section opening
style tag and a closing style tag and
you specified the style within this pair
of style tags so let's say we want to
apply a style to each one all the h1
elements within this document let me
make use of the h1 selector and just say
color orange and when you have an h1 tag
an h1 tag and just say header one when
you save it and refresh it we have a
style in our document that is applied so
this is called a document level style
sheet now the next one is the inline
style sheet
now the inline style sheet only applies
to the content of a single HTML element
for example we can have h2 and this is
Heather to now inst in line style sheet
is specified by using a style attribute
within the opening tag and then we can
specify the same style that we specify
within this enclosed style tags within
this pair of style tags so we can have a
style color which is let's say blue now
when we save this and refresh it we have
a header tube with blue color but here's
the difference an inline style only
applies to that particular line so once
again if we create an h1 tag this is
also orange but if you create an h2 tag
this is not blue so save it and reload
it there you go when we use a document
level style sheet it applies to all the
elements within the document so the h1
tags the first one and the second one
both have orange color now if the inline
tag though is going to apply to only one
particular HTML element and this time
it's only for the first h2 element the
second one is still going to be in the
default black color now the third one
and the most widely used style sheet is
the external style sheet so let's say
that we have 50 pages in our website and
having this particular style this right
here and 50 pages is well kind of
redundant so what we do instead is we
write this tile in a separate file and
just include that file in each one of
these 50 web pages so you know if it's
confusing give me two minutes and I'll
explain it to you
so what we do is create a new file and
this just save this as my style dot CSS
so an external style sheet needs to have
the extension of dot CSS so save it now
to specify a style like how we have been
using the style tag we can just copy the
content within the style tag and paste
it now let's say let's apply this for
the h3 element so h3 now if you want to
include an external style sheet then we
make use of a tag called link now the
link will take an attribute called
relation and for style sheets it is
going to be style sheet and the type
attribute is going to be text / CSS and
hf is going to be the link to our style
sheet so hf is equal to my style dot CSS
now save this and let's create an h3 tag
and we have h three let the color be
light blue or we already have blue I
believe orange and then a blue let's go
with light green so light green save
this create h3 this will be in light
green now let's save it when you refresh
it there you go we have an h3 which is
in light green color so by using
external style sheets it's it's very
advantageous because let's let's say
that you have 50 web pages and you have
all the h1 elements and the color orange
now later on you realize that okay
orange is not a good color I wanted to
change it to blue you're like oh my god
i need to change it in all 50 pages so
instead you can just change the color
over here so instead let's say
if you don't want a light green color we
can just change it to blue and since
this style sheet is going to be included
in all the 50 pages I just have to
change the color ones and it is going to
be reflected in all the 50 pages so
there you go this will be in light green
so I hope you guys got a basic
understanding of the different levels of
style sheets we have an inline style
sheet that applies to a single element
we have a document level statute that
applies to the document alone then we
have an external style sheet where we
declare a style separately and then we
use a link tag to included in our HTML
webpage so anyway thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
