let us go through some core concepts of
angularjs now the first thing we are
going to be learning about is modules
the angular module is where we write
pieces of her angular application it's
like a container for for our angular
code it's also the place where a
specified dependencies suppose we have
two modules and module a depends on
module B then we say there is a
dependency now let us go ahead and see
how to create a module now the module
usually resides in a file different to
the dot HTML file so let us go ahead and
create a new file and save it as AB dot
yes so da yes and and and dot yes type
variable app is equal to angular angular
dot module now the first parameter is
the name of the module let's go ahead
and name our module as my app and the
second parameter is the list of
dependencies now our module does not
have any dependency as of now so we are
going to go ahead and pass an empty
array go ahead save it let's go back to
our index dot HTML file and type script
source equals AB dot cheers to include
the Abdi's file and that's how we create
a module we have created a module called
my app and we have included it in our
HTML page now let us move on to the
second concept called directives now
what is a directive a directive is an
extension of an HTML element let us
understand with an example in a body tag
let us make use of a directive called
ng-app
and assign it the name of the module
which is my app
now directives begin with a prefix of ng
now why ng well the website says it
sounds a bit like angular you may beg to
differ but the ng app director creates
an angular application by running the
module called my app when the document
is loaded in other words the body tag is
now the owner of the angular application
and even though our module my app does
not do anything right now just by
specifying it we mean to say that
consider everything inside the body tag
as part of the angular application now
that we have learned how to create a
directive or how to use a new directive
let's go ahead and learn about
expressions now expressions are how we
are going to insert values dynamically
to an HTML page now suppose we have an
expression
well the syntax for an expression has
double curly braces and inside you can
specify either a literal or variables
for example if I type 5 go ahead
save it and if I reload the page it
types 5 now if I type 5 plus 3 go ahead
and save it and if I reload the page it
says 8 it's going to evaluate your
expression whenever we change it so
let's go ahead and specify a string
value so let's say hello and let us
concatenate it with there there save it
and when you reload it you have the
concatenated string right so far in this
video we have learnt three concepts
the first one is have
okay so the first one is a module a
module is a container for pieces of our
angular application the second one as a
directive directives begin with a prefix
ng and we have made use of the ng AB
directive which is going to create the
angular application excuse me and the
third one as expressions that we can use
to insert values dynamically into our
HTML page now if you're a bit confused
just stick with me for three to four
more tutorials and I promise you it's
going to get a whole lot better so thank
you for watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
