to a brand new series on angular now if
you are a returning subscriber you may
already know that there is an extensive
tutorial series in the channel on
angular 2 the reason I wanted to create
another series on angular is that there
are a couple of things that have not
covered in the angular 2 series which I
feel you should know as an angular
developer also as you may know as of
November 2017 angular is now angular 5
and there have been some changes as well
so in this video we're gonna have a
brief introduction to what angular is
and why you would want to learn angular
we will take a look at the history of
angular and whether you should learn
angular with all the version changes
that you see right now I also want to
discuss whether this series on my
channel will be useful to you in the
long run so let's get started
angular is a framework that is used to
build client-side applications and it is
especially great for building single
page applications where parts of the
view get refreshed asynchronously
without having to reload the entire page
so any application that relies heavily
on JavaScript angular is a great choice
now while you learn angular as opposed
to some other JavaScript framework or
library now there are a couple of points
the first one is that by design angular
promotes modular approach and hence the
application you build will have a clear
structure and by making use of
components which is a feature of angular
we can have a lot of reusable code
angular has a lot of inbuilt
capabilities such as validation routing
and so on which makes development
quicker and easier angular even makes it
possible to write unit testable and
easily maintainable code and finally
angular is also a product from the
Google team and makes use of typescript
language from Microsoft so it is safe to
angular is here to stay with that let's
take a brief look at anglers history the
first version of angular which is
popularly known as angularjs was
released in 2010 this was a huge hit and
a lot of organizations started using
angularjs to build their enterprise
applications but then in 2016
angular version 2 which was called as
just angular was released it was
announced that angularjs will refer to
the 1 dot X versions and angular without
the chairs will refer to versions 2 and
up in December 2016
angular 4 was announced version 3 was
skipped to avoid a confusion due to the
misalignment of the routers package
version which was already distributed as
version 3.3 oh but you don't have to
worry much about that and then there is
angular 5 which was released on November
1st 2017 and as of this recording the
latest version is angular 5 which is
what we will be learning in this series
now let's discuss about whether you
should learn angular with all the
version changes happening and if this
series will still hold good as the
versions change I've seen comments like
I didn't even get to angular 4 yet and
there's already angular 5 and I'm pretty
sure that this is a concern with a lot
of us so let me clear things out in any
framework there is always room for
improvement and same is the case with
angular so the Google team has decided
they will upgrade angular twice a year
and stick to semantic versioning now if
you're unaware in semantic versioning we
have a major version number of minor
version number and a patch number the
patch number which you see at the
rightmost is increase anytime there is a
bug fix or some sort of a patch the
minor version number increases when
there are added features that don't
break any functionality the major
version number
which you see on the left-hand side
changes when there is a break in any of
the functionalities and since angular
will be upgraded twice a year you can
see that the major version number
changing twice a year as well in fact
angle f6 is planned for April 2018 and
angle f7 for October 2018 but you don't
have to worry because the google team
has told that these versions will be
backward compatible and the changes you
see from version to version will not be
so great that it breaks your entire
application so you can without any
hesitation start learning angular and
angular is going to be one of the more
popular and powerful framers in the
future so definitely a good framework to
have in your pocket finally a few words
on whether the series will hold good in
the long run now as I mentioned already
the concepts in angular aren't going to
change with every version change so when
angular upgrades all I need to do is
change the title from angular 5 to
angular 6 or angular 7 and so on this is
to only ensure that people searching for
the tutorial can find it easily on
YouTube and at the end of the series I
will add additional videos for any
feature that changes with the version so
you can watch the series with the peace
of mind that what you learned will not
be wasted and you can come back to the
same series even a year from now so make
sure to subscribe to the channel and
enable notifications so that you are
alerted of the new content all right
then with this introduction let's get
started with angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
