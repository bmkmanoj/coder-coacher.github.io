discussed the four steps to fetch data
using HTTP in this video let's implement
them the first step is to make a get
request from the employee service now in
angular 5 we see a change in the module
responsible for HTTP till angular
version 4 we were using the HTTP module
but from version 5 we use the HTTP
client module the HTTP client module
provides a simplified api for HTTP
functionality for use with angular
applications let's go ahead and import
it into our application so go back to
visual studio code in the app module we
are going to have import HTTP client
module from angular / comment / HTTP and
add it to the imports array so that the
HTTP client module is accessible within
the app module
now what importing the HTTP client
module we are also registering the HTTP
service with English injector we don't
have to explicitly register it by adding
it to the providers metadata the HTTP
client module will do that for us and
now to use HTTP in our employee service
class we declare it as a dependency in
the constructor so in the employee
service class in the constructor type
private HTTP of type HTTP client and
make sure to import HTTP client as well
so we now have a local variable HTTP
which we can use to refer to an instance
of HTTP client so we are ready to make a
get request to fetch data using HTTP so
in the get employees method let's make
the request return this dot HTTP dot get
the get request takes in a URL as its
argument now because we don't have an
action
working webserver and it doesn't seem
practical to start a web server to serve
up four lines of employee data for our
example let's fetch the data from a file
which we assume to be on a web server so
within the project folder in the source
folder within the assets folder have
created a new folder called data and
within the data folder have created an
employee's dot JSON file that contains
our employee data we will serve the data
from this file instead of an actual web
server so back in our employee service
I'm going to create a new property
private underscore URL of type string
which points to assets data employees
dot JSON and in the get request let's
use this URL this dot underscore URL in
future if you do have a working web
server you can just replace this URL to
point to that web server the application
will still work as expected so our first
step is now complete we have made a get
request from the employee service the
next step is to cast the observable
which we receive as response to an
employee array now if you hover over the
get method you can see that it returns
and observable but for our application
this observable needs to be cast into a
format that represents an array of
employees so for that let's first create
an employee interface in the app folder
create a new file employee dot TS and
then add the code for an employee
interface so export interface I employee
now each employee has an ID a name and
an age perfect we now have an employee
type that the observable can be cast
into so let's go back to employee
service I'm gonna add a type to the get
request
this is going to be an array of I
employee and also make sure to import I
employee and the get employees method
will return an observable of type
employee array and make sure to import
observable from rxjs as well so that
completes our second step we have cast
the observable into an employee array
the third step is to subscribe to the
observable from the employee list and
employee detail component and the fourth
step is to assign the employee array to
a local variable so let's implement both
these steps together go back to visual
studio code and go to employee list
component here in the ng on init method
we are going to call the get employees
method and then subscribe to the
observable so I'm going to remove this
assignment and instead we are going to
subscribe to the observable returned by
the get employees method so dot
subscribe the first argument to the
SUBSCRIBE method is going to be a phat
error function that assigns the data
received from the observable to this
local employees property so the argument
is going to be data followed by the fat
arrow syntax and then this dot employees
is equal to data the left hand side is
basically the argument to the function
and the right hand side is the body of
the function we are assigning the
employee data to the employees property
let me explain what exactly is going on
in the Employee List component we have
an instance of the employee service we
use this to call the get employees
method this method returns an observable
so to receive data we need to subscribe
to it once we subscribe to the
observable the employee data arrives
asynchronously we assign that data to
our class property using the fat arrow
syntax so
let's do the same in employee detail
component as well
save this and refresh and you can see
that the application is still intact
I have even added an extra employee in
the JSON file just to make sure that we
are in fact serving the data from the
file using HTTP and not hard-coded data
from the employee service alright let me
quickly summarize what we have done
first we have included the HTTP client
module in our application next we inject
it as a dependency in the employee
service so now we have an instance of
HTTP client which we can refer to with
the HTTP variable we invoke the get
method passing the URL where the request
has to be made and this is nothing but
the file employees dot JSON now the get
method returns an observable but we need
to convert it into a type usable in our
application so we create an employee
interface and cast the observable into
an array of employees now we have a
method get employees in employee service
that returns an observable but the
observable doesn't provide the data
unless someone subscribes to it so in
the employee list and employee detail
components we subscribe to it from the
observable we get the employee data
asynchronously we assign the data to a
property in the component class and bind
it to the view and that is how we fetch
data using HTTP all right thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
