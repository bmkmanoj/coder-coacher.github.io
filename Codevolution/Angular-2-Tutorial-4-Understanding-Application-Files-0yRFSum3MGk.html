where we left off we see that the NPM
install command completed successfully
without any errors and that is great but
now that we have all the files gathered
we have all the necessary files gathered
for our angular application let's go
ahead and understand what each of these
files are and what they do now I'm going
to explain each of them in a sentence or
two only because if we dive into the
details of it it might be a bit
overwhelming to understand especially at
the beginning of this video series so if
you are really that interested in
learning more about them I recommend
that once you are through with this
video series go to the angular
documentation and learn about them ok so
the first file is the package.json file
now generally our angular applications
require certain libraries or modules for
their functioning and these are
specified in the package dot JSON file
so whenever you run npm install in the
command prompt all the dependencies
listed here are installed in our
application folder and the node
underscore modules folder to be more
precise so when you run npm install this
particular folder right here is going to
be installed now we are also going to be
discussing about the scripts but before
that I need to mention that for our
angular applications we are going to be
using typescript there's no need to
panic typescript is just JavaScript plus
some additional features so typescript
is a superset superset of JavaScript so
we are going to be learning those
additional features along the video
series so if you're comfortable with
JavaScript then that is more than enough
so coming back to the scripts over here
so if I hover over the start word over
here it says run by the NPM start
command so when you type NPM start in
the command prompt it is going to start
the typescript compiler since we are
writing
script code and it is also going to run
light or the light server which is going
to host our application so we are also
going to be starting the typescript
compiler in watch mode meaning to say
that any change in the code is going to
be automatically compiled and then the
browser is going to be refreshed then we
have the post install over here meaning
to say once we are done with installing
the dependencies zooming install the
typing star JSON file so if you go back
to when if you go to typing start JSON
it is going to say that install these
lists of dependencies once you install a
package dot JSON and why do we need
these so our application might use
JavaScript libraries that the types
could compile a contract nice so we make
the typescript aware of the libraries we
are loading so that there is no error
that is shown when we are building the
application all right the next one is
the TS config dot JSON so this contains
the configurations the guide the
typescript compiler for generating
JavaScript files now why JavaScript I
thought we were going to write
typescript code you might be wondering
that but our browsers can understand
only JavaScript so whenever we write the
typescript code it has to be converted
to the JavaScript code and the TS config
contains some of the configuration for
that next we have the system JS config
excuse me now this deals with loading of
the modules and the default file
extensions so we have we have our module
system here and we say that if there is
let's say for the app package the main
file would be main dot yes and then the
default extension if not specified is
going to be JavaScript then we have the
style dot CSS which is one thing but the
style for our HTML then we have our
index.html this can be broken down into
three
what's the first part is loading the
library so all the dot all the
JavaScript libraries are going to be
loaded over here and then the second
part is the configure system just so
that the system's yes so if you see here
system dot import app is there which we
go here it says app it is going to load
the main file so that is kind of like
entry point for our application and that
is going to be started over here and
then finally we have displayed the
application where we have the view for
our application which we are going to be
seeing in our browsers then finally
which brings us to our app folder right
the first thing is the main dot TS file
now this is where our application is
going to start from so you have a main
dot es and a main dot J's now there are
dot J's files in this app folder but
ignore them because these are the files
that are generated by the typescript
compiler so we are never going to mess
with the JavaScript files all our code
is going to go within the typescript
files which also brings us to app
component dot TS so again this is our
component or the root component that we
earlier learnt in the architecture so
this is the first component and just a
quick explanation because we are going
to be learning about components in
detail if you see that selector it says
my app so if you go to index dot HTML it
says my app over here so what it means
is that whenever you find my app tag in
the HTML replace it with this HTML code
so hello world and again you have a
corresponding J's file for that which is
going to be understood by the by the
browser and then a map things a map a
map file which is going to map between
the JavaScript and the typescript files
so
now if we go ahead and type NPM start in
our command prompt or good then it is
going to start our application let's
just give it a few seconds okay okay
yeah it's going to start the typescript
compiler it's going to start the light
server compliation changes are complete
and there we go
it says loading okay there's some
problem with it of time to load so we
have hello world displayed in our
browser so that's pretty much it about
what each of these files in the
directory structure do in the next video
let us understand how to how this hello
world actually happen what does the flow
of execution and yeah I know I'm pretty
sure some of you are thinking there's a
lot of explanation over here when are we
actually going to have some hands-on
coding but trust me there's patience and
understanding these initial concepts is
going to help you in the long run so
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget to subscribe I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
