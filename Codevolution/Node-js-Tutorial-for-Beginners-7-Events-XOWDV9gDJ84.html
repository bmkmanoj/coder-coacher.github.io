is pretty fast is because it is coded
around events now although there are a
lot of objects that emit events
depending on the situation in this video
let us see how to create our own events
and then trigger them ourselves let's
consider a very basic example when you
walk into a shop by opening the door a
tiny bell goes off that alerts the
shopkeeper that he has a customer so in
this case you opening the door is going
to be the event and we are going to
handle that event by ringing the bell so
this ringing the bell is actually called
an event handler what has to happen when
a particular event HAP occurs so let's
see how to put that into code now we
have to make use of a code module called
events when we are dealing with events
and even handlers so variable events is
equal to require the keyword and then
since events is a core module you can
just type in events then we need to make
use of the event emitter class so we
will event emitter is equal to new
events dot event emitter now let's see
let's first define what has to happen
when the door is opened so we need to
ring the bell right so very well ring
well is equal to an anonymous function
so function and then within the function
we can just log the bell goes ring ring
ring then put a semicolon now we can use
make we can make use of the event
emitter dot on so to specify what has to
happen when an event occurs so the event
we are talking about is opening the door
so door open and we're going to assign
the handler
ring bell so we are going to tell no
just that when this event occurs call
this function and then we need to
trigger that event so we are going to be
making use of even a meter dot emit and
this is going to emit our event door
open now if we save this open command
prompt and type node Abdullah ass goes
ring ring ring so our execution starts
here we are first emitting our door open
event now it checks through the code and
it finds out that when the door you door
open event occurs we need to call this
handler which is a function so variable
ring bell is our function and it goes
ring ring rain pretty great right now
it's also possible to pass arguments to
the function so let's say we have
another handler like let's let's say
that when the ring goes off ring ring
ring the shopkeeper is supposed to say
welcome so we can have another event a
meter dot emit and this time when the
bell rings
so our event is going to be bell rings
we can say welcome and we can directly
define event diameter dot on bell rings
a function right here saying function
message and then let's just logged the
message
now save this if you go back to your
command prompt no Abdo Jess so you enter
into the shop the bell goes ring ring
ring and then the shopkeeper hears that
and says welcome so just to explain it
in one go we are going to first omit the
event door open so on door open no Jess
knows it is going to help to call ring
bell so it goes here and says function
ring ring ring and once that is done we
are going to say emit bell rings you
know in fact we can just move this bell
rings on to our ring well function so
that once ring well starts executing is
going to ring ring ring and once that
ring ring ring is done it's going to
emit the bell rings event with a
parameter welcome which is then passed
into your function and then we are going
to lock the message so save it and
execute it again the swinging ring
welcome so that's how you deal with
events and even handlers and notes yes
how you create your own and trigger them
yourselves thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
