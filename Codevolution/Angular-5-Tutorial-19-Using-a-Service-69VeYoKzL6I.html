implement the three steps to use a
service in angular let's begin with step
one creating the employee service now to
generate a basic service template we use
angular CLI so in the integrated
terminal within the project folder run
the command ng G for generate s for
service and followed by name of the
service in our case it is the employee
service when the command completes you
should have a new file in the source
folder employee dot service dot TS and
if you take a look inside you have the
basic template for an angular service
now what is our service responsible for
to provide the employee data so in the
employee service class let's create a
new method get employees and we just
return the array of employees and in the
list and detail components initialize
the employees array to an empty array
empty array in the list component empty
array in the detail component so the
service now has a method that returns
the employees our first step is complete
we have created our service the second
step is to register the service with
angular's injector if we don't register
the service will be just another regular
class according to angular now there are
multiple places where you can register
the service but the place you register
is important because angular has a
hierarchical dependency injection system
so consider the example application it
has app module the app module has app
component the app component has two
components nested inside employee lists
and employee detail
here is how angular's di system will
work if you register in the employee
list component the service can be used
by the employee list component and its
children no other components not even
the employee detail component can use it
so this is not a good choice
now if you register with the app
component the app component and all its
children can make use of the service
this works fine but each module is
usually a feature area in your
application and might grow so it is
better if you register the service at
the module level by doing so components
under the app module can use it and to
register a service we use the providers
metadata so let's go back to visual
studio code in the app module include
employee service in the providers array
also make sure to import employee
service so our second step is now
complete we have registered a service
with angular's injector using the
providers metadata the third step is to
mention the dependency for this service
in the component that needs it and if
you remember from the last video the
dependency is specified in the
constructor so let's go back to employee
list component in the constructor I'm
going to use type scripts shorthand
syntax to make use of the dependency so
in the constructor private underscore
employee service of type employee
service and we also need to import it so
now we have a local variable underscore
employee service that gives us an
instance of the employee service next we
need to make use of the service instance
and fetch the employee data and the code
for that goes inside the ng on in it
life cycle hook we
haven't talked about lifecycle hooks but
the ng on in it hook gets called once
the component has been initialized so
inside the art init method this dot
employees is going to be equal to this
dot employee service dot get employees
so here is how this works we have the
employee service class employee service
class has a get employees method that
returns the employee data so in our
Employee List component we get hold of
an instance of employee service which is
underscore employee service and call get
employees method and assign the returned
data to the employees array that belongs
to the Employee List component now let
me do the exact same thing in the
employee details component private
employee service of type employee
service and then in the ng on init
method this dot employees is equal to
this dot employee service dot get
employees so now if we save this and
restart our application so NPM start
take a look at the browser and we still
have the list and details displayed but
this time we are doing it much more
efficiently of course we might have
different views to display the list and
details and also make use of routing to
switch between the views but I wanted to
focus solely on how to use a service and
this is how you do it create a service
register it with the injector and
declare it as a dependency in the
component that wants to use it alright
one last topic of discussion is about
the injectable decorator this right here
why is it required well injectable
decorator tells angular that this
service might itself have injected
dependencies so if you ever want to
inject a service into another service
injectable decorator is a must right now
the employee service doesn't have
dependencies so the injectable decorator
is not necessary but the employee
service might have dependencies in the
future and that is why it is recommended
to add this injectable decorator as soon
as you create a service class and since
angular CLI follows best practices it
adds the injectable decorator when you
generate a new service now you might ask
so how come we don't use the decorator
on the employee list or employee detail
component we don't see an injectable
decorator here right and the class still
makes use of the employee service well
that is because components have the
component decorator that lets angular
know hey I might have dependencies and
might make use of the dependency
injection system but for a service we
don't have that component decorator if
you remove the injectable decorator as
well it becomes a plain type script
class nothing to do with angular and
that is why injectable is required only
for a service and not a component all
right that is what I wanted to cover
about services let's take a look at HTTP
and observables in the next video thank
