is possible to specify certain default
values that must be entered in a
package.json file for example for every
project that we work on let's say we
want the author and the license to be
vishwas and MIT so let's see how to set
a default author name and a default
license for our package.json file now
let's go back to your command prompt and
to set a default author name the command
is npm config set in it - author - name
followed by the string so i'm gonna have
the author name as which was so i'm
gonna enter and now the default value
will be set now we can also set a
default value emitting this config
keyword so we can still say npm set in
it and this time let's set the license
so npm set in it license and we're going
to set this to MIT so now i'm gonna run
this and there you go
the default value is set so let's verify
i'm going to delete the package.json
file and let's rerun npm in it so npm in
it - - yes so that we don't have to
answer any questions and this has to be
NPM so when I run this it was going to
create the package dot JSON file and now
if you have a look the author name is
vishwas and licence is MIT so for any
project from here on if I run the NPM
init command it is going to have vishwas
and MIT as the author and license now to
check what are the default values that
have been said we can use get keyword so
the command is NPM config get in it -
author - name and when I press ENTER it
is going to give me vishwas and again we
can leave out this config keyword if you
wish to so I'm gonna say NPM get in it -
license
and there's going to give me the default
license that has been set which is MIT
now if you feel that you don't need a
default value anymore then we can delete
a default value and for the and the
command for that as NPM config delete in
it - license so let's delete the default
license there you go that has been
deleted and let's also delete the
default author names NPM config delete
Annette - author a you thr - name and
there you go the author is deleted as
well so now let me just delete
package.json file and rerun NPM in it -
- yes and there we go we have the
package.json file we have removed the
defaults that we had set so the author
is not vishwas anymore and the license
it is not MIT anymore ISC is the default
that comes with NPM so there was a quick
video on how to set some of the default
values in a package star JSON file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
