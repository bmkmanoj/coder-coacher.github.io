learn about the span tag and the div tag
now let's start let's start off with the
span tag let's say we have a paragraph
so in our body tag a new paragraph and
let's write this is a tutorial on HTML
and CSS all right now here's the thing
we know how to change the style of a
paragraph we can write a piece electr
and applied the required style now let's
say we want to increase the font size
but this time not of the entire
paragraph but only a portion of the
paragraph let's say we want to we want
to have HTML and CSS bigger then up the
rest of the text inside the paragraph
and in a different color now in such a
scenario we make use of an attack called
the span tag all right and here's how we
use it so we want to apply a style t
only HTML and CSS so first we're going
to wrap that text with an opening span
tag and a closing spend time and then
within our style tags we can apply a
style to this span tag so we have span
as our selector and we can have font
size font size let's say twenty eight
pixels and color color let's go with
light green all right now when we save
it and refresh it here's the output so
we have this is a tutorial on HTML and
CSS but this time we have applied the
CSS or we have applied the style only to
a portion of the paragraph tag so
whenever you want to apply styles to a
part of an element then we make use of
this band time
now on the other side we have another
tag called the div tag and div tag is a
short for division and it is used it is
usually used to group together elements
so let's say we have an h1 tag each one
and this is Heather one and let's say we
have h to this is header to all right
now we change your mind and we decide
that we want h1 h2 and the paragraph tag
all to be and a color of let's say
orange so one way to do it is
individually apply the orange color to
h1 and then h2 and paragraph or wrap
this text with a division so a div tag
at the starting you open a div tag and
at the end you close the div tag and
within our style within the within our
style tags apply the style to our div
tag so we can have color and what was
the color we had in mind orange all
right now you when you save it and
refresh it so here's what happens we can
apply a particular style to a group of
tags using the div tag and since we have
used a span tag within the div tag that
is going to apply its own style within
the div tag so a span tag takes
precedence over the div tag and that is
why we have this is Heather one this is
headed to and the paragraph in orange
color but when it comes to HTML and CSS
we have a different color on its own now
the div tag doesn't convey any semantic
meaning about it about its content like
you know a peeped p is for a paragraph
and each one is for a heading of level 1
and H 2 is a level 2 heading
but do the div tag is mainly used to lay
out the structure of your web page so
for example we can have a div for your
navigation and then we have we can have
a div for the main content of the web
page and then a div for the footer of
the web page so that way you can group
together elements and apply a particular
style to all of them so that's all i've
got about span and div tags but make
sure you you understand it thoroughly
because div tags are going to be there
is something that you're going to see a
lot of when you view the page source of
any web page so yeah that's pretty much
it thank you guys for watching don't
forget subscribe and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
