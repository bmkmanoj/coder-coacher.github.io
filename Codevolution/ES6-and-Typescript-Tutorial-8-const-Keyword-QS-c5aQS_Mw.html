to be learning about is the Const
keyword and the consequent is used to
create read only named constants and the
Const keyword is similar to the let
keyword in the sense that constellations
are also block scoped and they are not
hosted however a value must be
mandatorily set with constellation and
this value cannot be changed at the
later point within the same scope so let
us see what I mean by that let's create
LED num1 and this is completely fine we
can have a let declaration however when
using the constellation let's try out
Const num2 now it has a red underline it
says that constellations must be
initialized so apart from having a
variable declared we also need to
initialize it when using the Const
keyword so conce num2 is equal to ten
works completely fine now there is a
catch when declaring declaring an object
with the Const keyword let us see what
that is let's create a new object obj1
is equal to let's say name and code Mon
let's consult that log obj one dot name
and let me change this to cond okay let
me change it to Const obj1 okay
so let's save this and over here we have
the word code Mon now there's two things
that we can do the first thing which
won't work is assigning a new object to
obj one so obj one is equal to this does
not work if I hover over it it says left
hand side of an assignment expression
cannot be a constant so either we have
to remove this Const and replace it by
left or we have to remove this right
hand side that is one thing now what
does work is assigning new values to the
properties of the object so obj1 obj2 on
dot name can be set equal to Chandler
and we can have console dot log obj one
dark name now when I save this or here
we see Joe Duan and Chandler so just
remember with constellations you need to
initialize at the point of declaration
and you cannot reassign a value with
object declared using the Const keyword
you cannot assign a new object however
you can assign a new value to the
property of the object so that's pretty
much what I wanted to cover about the
concert thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
