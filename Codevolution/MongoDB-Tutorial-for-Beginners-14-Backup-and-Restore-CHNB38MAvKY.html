have a look at how to create backup and
restore data in MongoDB the first thing
wants to do is open command prompt and
connect in one go to instance right
we're done let's go ahead and minimize
that
the second thing open command prompt and
connect the Mongo shell all right done
let's minimize that third one it's open
command prompt but this time as an
administrator and let us navigate to the
bin directory of MongoDB so the bin
directory longer do we go ahead copy
that CD achievement directory so we're
currently in the bin directory now let
us see what we are working with let's go
back to Mongo shell and type show DB's
now we have company database a local
database by default and the new database
so company company database and new
database are the databases that we have
created and each of them contain
documents let us see how to create a
backup for these databases now go back
to your administration window and type
Mongo dump now this modem is the same
Mongo dump you see here so type one go
dump the Mongo dump is going to create
data or the backup in a folder called
dumb and one folder each for the
database that we have so we have a
company database and M and the
collections related to that and the new
database and the collections related to
the new database so that's how you
create backup of databases now let's see
how to restore data let's go back to
Mongo shell and delete these two
databases so use company DB da drop
database
let's use new database and then drop
that database so when you say show DB's
we only have local database let's go
ahead and restore the two databases so
go back to your admin window and type
Mongo restore done
so what Mongo restore does is goes
inside the dump folder checks for the
databases and then restores them now if
you go ahead and say show DB's again we
have the company database as well as the
new database so that's how you create
and create backup and restore databases
but what if you want to take backup of
only a particular database say the
company database now the command for
that is CD sorry Mongo dump and specify
the DB option and the database name
let's just delete the dump for now yes
go back Mongo damn - company so it
creates a dump folder but this time only
the company folder is created now let's
see how to restore only a single
database to go back to your Mongo shell
and say use company and then drop the
database so show TVs will give you only
local and new database and let's restore
the company database go back to your
admin window and type Mongo restore and
we need to specify the database name so
- - TV company I mean they specify the
path from where the restore has to
happen so dump slash company the
restoring company employees so done now
when we go ahead and say sure TVs we
have the company database back and
finally let us have a look at
how to backup and restore only single
collections from a database now let's go
back and delete the dump folder actually
let's just have dumb folder go back to
admin window and let's say Mongo dump
now let's deal with the new database
that we have so we have a database
called new database and in the new
database we have a collection called
new collection new use new data base
show collections so we have new
collection as a collection let us see
how to backup and restore new collection
so go back to your admin window say
Mongo dump - - DB new database so we are
specifying in our new database the
collection is present and the collection
is - - collection and then new
collection so when we press enter it's
going to create a new folder here called
new database and we have the new
collection that piece on document now
let's see how to restore that so DB dot
new collection dot drop true so show
collections I don't have the new
collection anymore let us see how to
restore that so one go restore okay let
me just type it out Mongo restore
specify the database
- ivenn DB new database - - collection
that is new collection this time we need
to specify the particular file so it is
and dump folder new database folder
and the main this new collection dot
reason so done now when we say show
collections we have the new collection
back alright guys so that's how you
create a backup and restore a single
collection or a single database or
multiple databases thank you for
watching please subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
