variables is inevitable so in this video
let us have some of the ways we can
declare variables in typescript now the
first example is what we've been doing
in JavaScript which still works in
typescript so we can have variable X is
equal to 10 so first we declare using
the war keyword but this could also be
let are Const I'm using war so that we
can relate it better to JavaScript now
war keyword is followed by an identifier
and then the assignment so we are
declaring a variable X and assigning a
value 10 but a very important concept
that applies in typescript
is type inference since we have assigned
a number 10 typescript is going to infer
that X is of type number now if I hover
over this X you can see that var X colon
number so I can similarly have string
and boolean declarations so our Y is
equal to let's say hi and VAR z is equal
to true so now when I hover over Y it
says VAR y colon string and var said :
boolean so typescript is going to infer
that x y and z are of type number string
and boolean respectively now the second
example is where we explicitly specify
the type of a variable for that we make
use of annotations so we can have VAR a
then we use this colon which is the
annotation which indicates that we are
going to be specifying the type of the
variable on the right hand side so or a
colon number is equal to 10 so these two
declarations are exactly the same the
first one is a type inference the second
one as we are explicitly specifying the
type and the initialization is not
mandatory
so we can have war be : string and type
script will know that the value of B has
to be a string throughout the code so
two points mainly the first one type
inference where you declare a value and
initialize that and typescript is going
to infer the data type of the variable
and the second method where we
explicitly specify the type of the
variable and this time initialization is
not compulsory to know the type of this
particular variable so that's pretty
much it for this video thank you guys
for watching don't really subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
