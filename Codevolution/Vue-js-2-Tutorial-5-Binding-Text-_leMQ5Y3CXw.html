the view instance to the HTML template
the first one is using the mustache
syntax which is also known as the double
curly braces and this is the approach we
have already seen if we have a data
property called name you just include it
within a pair of double curly braces in
your HTML and view takes care of binding
the data so we have a name of value
vishwas and when we bind this we get
hello vishwas in our browser now the
mustache syntax can be used as part of a
larger string like in this example hello
name or it can also be the only content
of the HTML element for example I can
remove hello save this refresh the
browser and it still works it is also
possible to have multiple mustaches
within a single HTML element let's say
we create a new data property let's call
this greet and let's say hello and in
the h1 tag we can add double curly
braces and specify greed now if you have
a space over here
save it and refresh we should be able to
see hello vishwas so all these
approaches work just fine the second way
is using a directive and a directive is
nothing but a special HTML attribute and
in moochers each directive has a V dash
prefix now the directive use for binding
text is V dash text so let's take a look
at an example and understand this better
let's create a new property I'm going to
call this app name and this is going to
be code evolution now if we have to bind
this using the v-tex directive here is
the syntax let's create a new div tag to
this div tag we add the directive V dash
text and then to this directive we
assign a value of the data property and
this time it is going to
appname the property we just created and
notice that the inner text of the HTML
element is left blank this is because
the v-tex directive replaces the data
property value as the inner text of this
particular HTML element so let's save
this and refresh and you can see the
data binding there you go you can see
code evolution now the only drawback of
v-tex directive is that it replaces the
entire text content of the HTML element
with the data property value so if I
wanted something like my app name is
followed by the application name it is
not possible with the v-tex directive
let's save this and take a look at the
browser now if i refresh it you can see
that it still says code evolution this
particular text over here is not visible
that is because the v-tex directive
replaced code evolution with the entire
text content of this div tag so that is
about the v-tex directive to summarize
we have two ways to bind text we have
the master syntax and also the V text
directive you can use the mustache
syntax to bind partial or full text
content in an HTML element whereas V
text director can only be used to bind
full text content now the cool thing
about data binding is that the UI
reactively updates anytime there is a
change in the value of that particular
data property so in the browser console
if I update this name to a new value you
can see that the UI also reflects that
updated value let's take a look let's go
back to the browser I'm gonna inspect
element go to the console and the way we
access the data property is by using the
reference given to our view instance in
our case it is VM so it is going to be
VM dot followed by the data property now
if you want to change the name it is
going to be named and we can assign it a
new value I'm going to say
you value and you can see that the
browser or the UI automatically reflects
that change in the data property value
so hello new value this is really
helpful when you're you I should update
based on some input from the user but
sometimes you may not want the UI to
reflect any change in the data property
value for that view provides another
directive so let's take a look at that
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
