number 26 now before we start off though
on borders I need to explain the CSS box
model now according to this box model
every HTML element can be considered as
a box now this box has the following
four pieces content up adding a border
and a margin for example let's say
consider that you're wrapping a gift for
your for your friends birthday so what
to do is you have the main content and
let's say it's it's a gift that is made
out of glass and it's very fragile so
what you do is you add some sort of a
padding of some kind of paper let's a
newspaper so you wrap that gift around
with newspaper which is the padding and
then you enclose it within the gift box
now this gift box is like the border in
our box model and finally if you place
your gift next to your friends get the
amount of space between the two gift
boxes is nothing with the margin and
this box model is a very important
concept in CSS so let's learn these one
at a time and let's start off with the
border now the first property that we
can have for a border is the border
style so let's create for an h1 element
the different types of borders that are
possible so as I mentioned the first
property is border style now the
possible values well there are several
values that we can assign to a bordel
style the first one let's consider a
dotted value let me create an h1 element
and box model let that be the text when
you save and refresh it so there we go
we have an h1 tag box model and this is
going to have a border and the style of
this border is going to be dotted we can
also have a dashed border by specifying
dashed as the
you so when you refresh it you have a
dashed border we also have solid when
you say with refresh you have a solid
border around the h1 tag now there are
two more values inside which kind of
gives you a 3d look we should refresh it
there you go it looks like the box model
is embedded inside some sort of a box
and we also have outside so when you
save it reload it and there you go the
box model now looks as if it is elevated
from the web page now the second
probability that we can have for our
border is the word of it so border wait
and let's say we can figure something
like 10 pixels let me just quickly
change this to solid so that it is
easier to notice the difference and
there you go so we have the width of the
border 10 pixels now it is also possible
to specify a color for our border so
border color and let's say orange when
you save it reloaded our border is now
going to have an orange color now here's
the thing though you can individually
specify the border style wet and color
for each or the four part of the border
so you have a left border you have a
right border you have a top border and
abort the border now let's say we want
to assign a specific color only to the
left border so water left color let's
say this we need it in green and then
order bottom color let's say we could
have this in blue color now when we save
it we can also have a right color but
yeah let's go with three for now
so what happens is that the top color is
going to be orange which is the original
border color and then we have specified
that the left should be in green and the
bottom should be in blue so we have a
left border in green color and the and
the bottom border in blue color now this
individuality can be applied to bottom
style and bottom width as well so you
can have bottom top width or bottom
Saudi border bottom with border top
width and so on now one last thing is
the shorthand notation of the border
property so we can have something just
like instead of specifying a whole lot
of things border and then you can
specify first the width so let's say
five pixels then you can specify the
border style let's say a solid style and
we can specify a color let's say blue
now when you save it and reload it so
what that does is it is going to create
a border there is five pixels in red it
is going to be of a style solid and a
color blue so this is the shorthand
notation that comes and handy a lot of
times but yeah that's pretty much it
about borders in the next video let us
learn about padding so thank you guys
