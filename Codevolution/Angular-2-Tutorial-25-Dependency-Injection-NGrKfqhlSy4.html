25 and in this video we are going to
learn about dependency injection now to
get a better understanding of D I have
split the video into three parts the
first part I'm going to explain a bit of
code that doesn't make use of di and
mention its drawbacks in the second part
I'm going to talk about dependency
injection as a design pattern and
explain how it takes care of the
drawbacks and in the third part I'll
talk about dependency injection as a
framework that angular provides so let's
start with the first part let's have a
look at some code that doesn't make use
of dependency injection alright so we
have a class car and for simplicity
let's assume that we just need an engine
and few tires to build a car and the car
constructor itself creates its own
copies of engines and tires so the two
dependencies engines and tires are
instantiated within the card constructor
simple enough right
but this code has a few problems now the
first one let's say that the engine
class evolves and its constructor can
now accept a parameter but when we
change the engine our car is broken so
we need to change the code inside the
class car to accept a parameter in the
engine constructor and similarly if we
accept a parameter for the tires
constructor we need to go and make a fix
again in this car class so the very
first drawback is that our code is not
flexible anytime the dependency changes
we need to change the car class now the
second drawback is that this code does
not really favor testing now anytime we
create a car we get the same engine and
the same tires so what if we want to
test how a car would behave with let's
say an old engine or a new engine or
maybe different types of tires
now this is not possible at all and even
if even if we did create a different
engine or maybe different tires
what if they in turn have some
dependencies how do we create those
dependencies so basically we are not in
control of our code and this is where
our second part of the video that is
dependency injection as a design pattern
is going to help us let's have a look at
that now basically di is a coding
pattern in which a class receives its
dependencies from external sources
rather than creating them itself so
let's have a look at the code with di
and understand this definition now if
you have a look we have moved the
definition of the dependencies from
inside the constructor to the parameters
of the constructor so the card class
doesn't create the dependencies anymore
it just consumes them the creation of
the dependencies is going to be done
externally to this class and by doing
this both the drawbacks we had
previously are solved so to create a car
we will have something like this so we
have wire my engine equals new engine
my tires equals new tires and my car is
going to be new car and we are just
going to pass my engine and my tires as
parameters and if there is a change in
the engine constructor we just add it
like this and even though this
definition of the engine changes the
definition of car doesn't change and the
similar scenario with tires even though
we are adding a parameter to the
constructor of my tires or tires Clause
my car still remains the same so even if
we make changes to the dependencies the
car class is not undergoing any fix and
the same goes with testing as well now
we are in complete control of the
dependency so we can pass in mock data
to the constructor to suit our test
cases for example we can pass old engine
and old tires and create an old car
because we can do so and we can pass in
new engine and new tires and we can test
for a new car so whatever the data that
we are passing the definition of the car
class doesn't change we can test for
multiple scenarios using this approach
so that is about di as a design pattern
but now we have another problem at hand
so with di we create a car by passing
the dependencies as parameters but
here's the thing we as the developer
need to create those parameters first so
right now we just have two dependencies
so we are fine but what if the car had
let's say 10 or 20 dependencies we need
to create all those dependencies before
passing them as parameters and what if
those dependencies in turn have
dependencies on something else
then we first need to create those
dependencies and as the number of class
or dependencies grow it becomes really
really difficult for us to manage the
code for example have a look here I have
my car again but this time it has
multiple dependencies my engine my tires
dependency a dependency B and so on
until dependency Z so we need to create
all these dependencies ourselves and if
you have a look here now dependency Z
has another dependency on dependency a B
so we first need to create dependency a
B and then pass it as a parameter to
dependency Z so this becomes really
really difficult for the developer and
this is where di as angular's framework
comes into picture now angular's di
framework is like hey give me some
initial information that I need and I'm
going to manage all the dependencies for
you so if you want a car just ask for a
car don't worry about its engines or the
tires or any of their dependencies I'm
going to take care of all that and give
you a car so the DI framework makes a
double
first job that much more easier if I
want a car I just ask for it I don't
have to know how to create a car I don't
have to know if the car is dependent on
anything else or if those dependencies
are again in turn dependent on something
else that is the power of di framework
in angular now let's see how to make use
of di framework to implement services in
angular now there are three steps the
first one is you define the dependency
the second step you register the
dependency with angular built in
injector now that is nothing but a
container of all the created
dependencies and finally the third step
is you just list the dependency in the
class that needs it and angular will
inject those dependencies so three steps
create register inject that is all there
is to it
so let's relate this back to our angular
application we have and see how to use
the services now the three steps again
the first step here our dependency is
the employee service so define the
employee service class which is going to
provide access to shared data the second
step register it with angular
injector the third step declare it as a
dependency an Employee List component
and employee detail component why
because they need the employee data and
employee service is going to provide to
provide that to them so Employee List
and employee detail have a dependency on
employee service for their data so I
don't know prove pictorially it kind of
looks like this this is the angular's
injector and it has employee service and
employee list and employee detail are
the components and they go like hey I
have a dependency on employee service
can you give that to me
and then the injector goes like sure man
I can provide it to you and then it
injects employee service and employee
surveys to employee lists and employee
detail and one really important thing to
keep in mind is that angular will create
only a single
instance of the service and injected to
both the components so employee service
will be a single instance provided to
both employee list and employee detail
it is called as single done service so
that is said about di and if this video
was a bit too much I recommend you re
watch the video twice or thrice and I'm
pretty sure that you guys will get a
good understanding of di and services so
with this background let's write some
code in the next video to implement this
employee service so thank you guys for
watching and don't really subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
