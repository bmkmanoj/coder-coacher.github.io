15 and in this view we are going to get
started with the angular part of the
video application and in particular we
will start with angular routing so we
will create the different components and
set up the corresponding node along with
the UI to navigate to those runs now if
you recollect from the demo application
from video number 4 we are going to have
two main compliments a home component
and a video center complement so the
home component can be anything to be
honest but we will just add a banner
that says video player and in the video
centered component we will display the
video left and the details so the first
step is to create the two component and
again we will be using angular CLI
folders so open command prompt in the ng
app folder which is our project folder
and run the command mg g t home this is
the angular CLI command to generate a
component cheese temper generate C
stands for component and cone is the
name of our component similarly we are
also going to create a video single
component so ng g c video cinder so the
angular CLI command creates two folders
in the app folder one for each component
so if i navigate inside the source
folder within the app folder you should
have a home folder and a video center
folder within the home folder we have
all the files related to the home
component and within the video center
folder we have all the files related to
the video center component now our next
step is going to be configuring the
adult to these two components so open
apps routing module now I'm going to
copy paste the route and explain what
the rules are so now we have three tabs
the first tab is an empty path and we
really directed to the Home tab and what
is the home path it is nothing much
rendering the home company and similarly
for the videos tab we are going to
render the
a similar component now we have the rest
could be here because we need to import
these two components so important
component and import video center
company so now allows a setup in the app
component let's add the UI to navigate
to these jobs now again for styling we
will be making use of bootstrap
so first let's add that to this project
open command prompt and in the command
prompt I'm going to run the command npm
install - - slave bootstrap and in
angular CLI dot JSON type let's tell
angular to use this bootstrap as well so
we're here in angular CLI dot J's on
navigate to style and just below sides
of data we are going to include the tab
to to bootstrap so this is going to be
the path right not getting this right
there you go so this is the path to
bootstrap CSS now let's go back to app
comm app company dot HTML and create the
UI so we're here in AB dot company dot
HTML right now we just have the title
and again I'm going to copy paste code
and explain what that code does so lets
me copy and paste it alright so first we
have the bootstrap class again navbar in
your container fluids navbar header nav
bar brands and we just want a real pair
that refreshes or doesn't target
anywhere and then we have again some
more bootstrap styling and this is where
our code comes or angular code is
written so we have a button or an anchor
tag that that is all and when you click
on that you go to the Home tab and the
Home tab is nothing like rendering the
home component and similarly we have
another anchor tag that displays the
text later and then you click on
playlist
it is going to go to videos tab and what
is the videos tab it is nothing but
rendering the video center component
alright now we are ready to test the
logging feature at first you need to
execute ng build command again because
we have modified our angular application
so go back go back to command prompt and
run ng build and that our build is
complete let's go to the browser and
intensive so localhost colon 3000 there
you go we have the navigation bar we
have our brand video player lexicon this
basically nothing happened and then we
have the full text and playlist text
basically these two are linked now when
I navigate to just localhost 2000 we are
navigating back to look at history tells
in flash home and that is how home words
so this is the home component ticker
now when I click on playlist it says
video center work and the URL gets
updated to slash videos so if you check
over here in a routing module we have a
home pad and a videos path corresponding
film component and the video centric
company when there is nothing
it gets redirected to home complement so
nothing gets redirected to whole
playlist goes to videos and home go
straight home and home component gets
rendered playlist component renders
video centered complement alright in the
next video let's add more code to the
home component and the video center
component so thank you guys for watching
your credit subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
