page we first needa specified that in
the manifest file so over here I'm going
to have options underscore page and this
is going to be options dot HTML so now
let's go ahead and create the UI for our
options page so I'm going to create a
new file options dot HTML and we're
going to have some pretty basic HTML so
first the doctype there's going to be
HTM okay there's going to be HTML and
then we're going to have the HTML tag a
head tag and then we're going to have a
title tag that's going to say budget
manager options and then we are going to
have to include our JavaScript and for
that I'm going to just copy from this to
copy options dot HTML paste it and I'm
just going to change pop-up to options
and the JavaScript we will be
implementing this in the next video
so we have our scripts in place now we
can go to the body and we're going to
have an h1 tag that's going to say
Budget Manager options and then an h2
tag now this is going to have a limit
and we are going to input ID is equal to
did I get that right so input type is
equal to text ID is equal to we're going
to call this limit and then we don't
need the name and value okay and then we
need two buttons let's go over here and
then input type equals submit we're
going to have an ID and there's going to
be same limit we don't need a name
let's have a value that says save limit
and then we're going to have something
similar so input type equals submit
instead of save limit we're going to
have reset total and the value is going
to be reset total so now let's reload
our extension and have a look at our
options view I so I've reloaded this and
if you see here an options link also
appears so when I right click on this I
get this options and when I click on
that we have our budget manager options
we have a limit to enter over here and
two buttons so of course these buttons
don't do anything right now let's
implement the functionality in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
