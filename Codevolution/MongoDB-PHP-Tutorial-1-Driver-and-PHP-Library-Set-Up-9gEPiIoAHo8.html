to a short tutorial series on how to use
MongoDB with PHP now the folks at
MongoDB decided to change the MongoDB
driver for PHP so I decided to make a
sublet tutorial series just to let you
guys know how to use the updated model
driver with PHP now I highly recommend
you go through the MongoDB series for
beginners in my channel before watching
the series okay so before we get started
we have some initial setup that has to
be done now the first thing obviously is
you need to have downloaded and
installed MongoDB now I have the version
3.2 for the 32-bit version because my
computer is 32 bit and the second thing
is you need to have zamp installed so
that we can work with PHP and third
thing or next what we have to do is
install the PHP driver that MongoDB
provides so in Google type MongoDB
drivers now open the first link and over
here if you scroll down to the bottom it
says drivers and if you scroll down more
you have PHP now next to PHP you have
the releases now click on releases and
this is going to provide you a list of
dll's now we are going to be making use
of the latest version one point one
point seven so click on the windows DLL
downloads and this is going to redirect
you to another page now we have the DLL
list over here but to know what DLL to
choose open let me start speech be
Apache let me go to localhost flash 8080
okay now over here I have five point six
version so
- go back - okay here we are so we are
going to be making use of five points
okay sorry we're going to be making use
of PHP five point six
now within five point six we have
several options now x86 432 or x64 for
64-bit now I have a 32-bit so let us
down to the first two names now the
first one is non thread-safe
and the second one is a thread safe now
if you go to your zine folder and then
go inside PHP now you can have a look at
so PHP 5ts DLL that means to say it's
thread safe so over here we are going to
install 5.6 thread safe for the 32-bit
machine so if you have a 64-bit machine
go for the 64-bit one so I have already
downloaded it or the zip file I already
have it downloaded it so I already have
it downloaded so let me extract over
here okay this is going to provide me
with the PHP underscore MongoDB DLL so
to associate this DLL with our PHP in
zamp copy this go to C dry Zam or
wherever samples installed for you go to
PHP go to e xt folder and paste it over
here so you have the PHP MongoDB DLL
along with the rest of the DLLs now
let's go back over here we need to
scroll all the way down to the php.ini
file so this will usually be above the
PHP dot ini development so edit with
notepad plus plus and do a find on
Windows XP or Windows extension so this
is going to give us the list of
extensions over here right below let's
go with MySQL since it is an
alphabetical order what you have to do
is copy this file name so
copy this and over here in notepad plus
plus right above my SQL extension type
extension is equal to the PHP MongoDB
dot yellow now save this and we'll have
to also restart our Apache server ok so
that's pretty much it how to install the
driver that is going to get us started
but here's the thing the driver is going
to provide the bare minimum to work with
PHP so the recommended way is to use the
PHP library that comes along with
MongoDB driver that provides a more
full-featured
API that we can use so to install the pH
or to download and install the PHP
library we make use of composer
now composer is something similar to
node package manager or NPM so for PHP
it is composer so and by the way I'm
going to be dropping down the links for
each of these sites in the description
below so go to get composer orgy
click on download and click on download
and run composer setup exp exe now I've
already done this so I already have
composer installing my computer so let's
go to C Drive Sam HD dogs let's create a
new folder or project that we are going
to be working with let's call this PHP
MongoDB now let's open command prompt
over here so right click holding down
shift open command window over here and
we are going to be making use of the
composer to download and install the PHP
library so any library that you want to
associate with your PHP project composer
is going to help you with that now I
have this particular line over here or
the command that needs to be executed
I'm going to be pasting this in the
description as well so copy this
and pasted and this going to take a
couple of seconds but it is going to
create all the documents that is
required so that we can work with PHP
and MongoDB so the PHP library is a
dependency for our project so composer
is going to download it and install it
ok so we are done so that's pretty much
it
all the initial setup that we need to
get started just to recollect
downloading some MongoDB second step
download and install Sam third step
download and install the appropriate
MongoDB driver for PHP and fourth step
download composer so that we can install
the PHP library fifth step create the
folder that we want to work in and
download the PHP library for MongoDB
using the composer so in the next video
let us see how to get started with by
working on some of the operations on
MongoDB so thank you guys for watching
and I'll see you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
