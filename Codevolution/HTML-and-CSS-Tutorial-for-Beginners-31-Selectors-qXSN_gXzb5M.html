we are going to be learning about
selectors now what I mean by that is we
are going to be learning the different
ways in which we can select the HTML
elements so that we can apply some kind
of a style to them now the first
selector is called an element selector
and this is something we've been using
for the past few tutorials so you should
be very familiar with it so let's say we
want to apply a style to the paragraph
tag we use the paragraph element as the
selector and then we specify some sort
of style so let's say a color and let
this be in blue and we create a
paragraph within the body this is
paragraph 1 let's say and save it and
when you reload it we have this is a
paragraph one in blue color so that's
how an element selector works the second
type of selector is an ID selector
excuse me now consider the situation we
have let's say multiple paragraph
multiple paragraphs this is power to and
then a new paragraph this is Kara three
now let's say that okay I'm writing some
sort of an article and the first
paragraph I wanted to be in a blue color
the second paragraph in red color and
the third paragraph in green color now
right now we cannot do that because the
path the paragraph element selector is
going to apply the color to all the
paragraphs so if we save it and refresh
it we have this is paragraph 12
disappear graph three all and blue color
now what we can do is assign an ID
attribute or have an ID attribute in the
opening tag and let's specify a value to
this ID let's say this is paragraph one
so para one now if you want to specify a
style to just this paragraph then we can
select this paragraph using this ID
so we have a hash symbol and then
followed by the ID value so PA RA one
now what this does is just going to
select only the first paragraph and
apply the color blue when you save it
and reload it so we have the first
paragraph and blue color the second and
the third with no default with no blue
color but the default black color so
that's how ID selector works you assign
an ID to the HTML element to which you
want a style to be applied and then you
can specify the particular ID selector
using the hash symbol followed by the ID
value now the third type of selector is
a class selector so once again consider
the situation where there are on 30
students who are willing to take up the
HTML and CSS class so what a teacher
does is put them all together in one
class and then start teaching so that
all the 30 students are going to learn
at the same time now a class selector is
something very similar you just create a
class and apply a style to it and you
assign that class to all the HTML
elements to which you want that same
style to be applied let me show you what
I mean now to create oh let me just
quickly to leave this ID to create a
class we use a dot followed by the name
of the class so let's say this is going
to be right paragraph so everything this
read paragraph style are voluminous this
read paragraph is is a class and it's
going to have a style which is red color
now if I want to apply this same class
to multiple elements then we use a
keyword called class and then its value
is going to be this class name so red
hair when you say what
and refresh it you see that the first
paragraph is now in red color now in the
same way if we have a class once again
is equal to red power ok para and
refresh it now you have the first and
the third paragraphs in red color now in
the same way you can create multiple
classes and assign them to multiple
elements and they're all going to have
the same style that is defined within
the particular class so a read paragraph
class is going to assign this color red
to all the elements to which it is it is
defined as an attribute now the final
excuse me the final selector are
actually not final one but the next
lecture is called the universal selector
so let's say we have an h1 tag 8 h 1
hello and then an h2 tag hello and then
an H Y tag let's say small all right now
what if we want let's say we want a font
type or a font style or a font family to
be applied throughout a Reb document so
what we do is use a universal selector
now that is represented by the star
symbol now if I if we specify the star
it means that select every element and
apply the style red color so when you
save it and refresh it we have each and
every HTML element that has been colored
red so just a quick recap we have an
element selector like a paragraph
element that move with which we can
apply a style we have an ID selector
when we have a unique ID within the web
page and we want to assign a star to
that particular ID we have a class
selector and finally we also
the universal selector now that's pretty
much it for this video in the next video
I've got a few more lectures and we'll
see how to deal with them so thank you
guys for watching and don't face
subscribe i'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
