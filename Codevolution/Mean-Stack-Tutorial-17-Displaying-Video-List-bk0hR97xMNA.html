display an alley of hard coded videos
now just like how we had a video
represented by a model in express we are
going to represent a video using a class
in English so let's use English
real-life to generate a video class
let's open command prompt again and the
command to generate a class is in G G or
generate field for class followed by the
class name now this is going to create a
type good v video dot here so in video
three of code I'm going to open video
dot PS file and this video does here
files is going to contain the video
class so again I'm going to copy paste
the code now each video in angular is
going to have an ID a title a URL and a
description so this is to mimic the
fields in MongoDB alright now one thing
you have to make note of is that we will
be handling most of the functionality in
the video center component the video
list component is responsible for just
displaying the list of videos and then
the video details component is
responsible for just displaying a
detailed view of the particular video so
our array of hard-coded videos will be
present in the video center component
and this alley will be passed as an
input to the video list component which
will then display the list so let's see
how to do that now I have already
created created an array of four videos
in video centre component so videos
array is going to be of type video which
is what we just created so I'm going to
improve this class so that should get
rid of the red squiggly so we have video
which is an array of video and
each video has an ID a title URL and
then the description and we have a list
of four videos over here declares in
videos in the consonant now in video
Center component HTML we are going to
subscribe that there is an input to the
video list and for that we use property
data by me so videos in square brackets
is equal to what is the name of our
property videos and in the video list
component so video list and then video
list component dot PF over here they
specify that this component has an input
so input and within square brackets what
is the input it is the videos array so
the property specified over here is
going to have to match this input
property and then in video list
component HTML we can display the list
of videos using the ng4 directive so
again we are going to make use of some
bootstrap styling so naps now help and
nab stag so this is just going to stack
the list of videos vertically and then
you use the ng for directives and for
each video in the videos added your just
we are just going to display the title
alright now we can build and test our
application so let me go back to command
prompt and type ng build now let's go
back to the browser reload this now if
you have a look over here I have title
one title to title three entire four and
this is nothing but the titles of the
four videos title one title to title
three and then a title for now let me
quickly explain how this works so far so
in the video center component with this
we have declared an array of videos so a
list of four videos in video centers
component HTML
where we have nested the video list
component is despite that there is an
input and what is the input it is
nothing but the array of videos that we
have declared now this is going to be
accepted in video list dot component
because we specify over here in the
input array so the videos are input for
this component so now that we have the
input we can use that over here in the
ng4 directive it plates over each of the
video but just display the video title
and then we make use of some bootstrap
styling to display vertically and that
it helps that is how we have the list of
four video titles displayed vertically
alright in the next video let's create a
detailed view for each selected video so
thank you guys for watching don't forget
and I'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
