look at symbols in es2015 so in es5 we
have the existing primitive types
strings num boolean null and undefined
but now es2015 introduced a new
primitive type known as symbols and the
purpose of a symbol is to generate a
unique ID but the funny thing is that we
never get access to that ID and there is
sort of a good thing as we are going to
be seeing later on in this video so let
us understand how to create a new symbol
and what could be the possible use of
that symbol so to create a new symbol we
invoke the symbol function so let s
equals symbol now if you try to use the
new keyword here it is going to throw an
error and we are going to be ignoring
the red squiggly for now so let s equal
symbol and now when we try to log to the
console type off s let's save this head
over to the browser
it says symbol so now in ES 2015 we have
a new type known as symbol and we can
also pass an optional symbol description
while creating a symbol so within
parentheses we can specify a string so
we can just call this first symbol and
now when we log symbol or s dot to
string we can get access to this
description so when I save this and
refresh there you go a symbol with
description first symbol so when we call
the to string method on the symbol we
get the description okay so now let's
create two more symbols let s 2 as equal
to symbol and let s 3 equals symbol now
I'm going to log to the console s 2
triple equals s 3 so what do you think
the output is going to be true or false
so let's save this and head over to the
browser it's false so therefore a symbol
always creates a unique ID so this
symbol has a different ID from this
symbol so s 2 and s 3 are different but
now let's pass a description test and
over here let's pass the same
description test so now what do you
think the output is going to be let's
save this it's still false so it doesn't
matter what the description is a symbol
is always going to create a unique ID
now let's say that we have created a new
symbol but we need to get hold of that
symbol so that we can use the same
symbol again in a different or the same
file so for that purpose we have a built
in symbol registry so to add a symbol to
the registry we use the symbol dot form
method so we can create a symbol also
using symbol dot form so let s 4 is
equal to symbol dot 4 and we need to
pass a description so let's pass this as
reg symbol or registry symbol and here's
the thing though symbol dot 4 doesn't
add the symbol right away
it checks if a symbol with the key reg
symbol already exists in the registry if
it does it will return that symbol over
here to s 4 if it doesn't exist then it
will create a new symbol in the registry
so let's also do let s 5 is equal to
symbol doubt for symbol symbol dot 4 and
let's use the same reg symbol so now
let's do a log to the console S 4 triple
equals s 5
so when I save this and head over to the
browser symbol is not defined let me
change this to caps change this also to
caps and let's save this and there you
go it's true so what happened here is
that when we did a symbol dot for on the
first time a new symbol was created in
the global registry with this
description and when symbol dot four was
called again with the same description
this symbol was retrieved and stored in
s file so now S 4 and S 5 both the
symbols are the same we have no clue as
to what the ID for these two symbols are
but we just know that they're equal now
let's say we want the key that was
associated with the symbol when the
symbol was added to the global registry
so for that we have another use we have
another method to make use of called
symbol dot key 4 so let's say console
dot log symbol dot key for let's pass s
4 so when I save this and head over to
the browser symbol is not defined okay
let me change this back refresh and read
symbol so the symbol that key 4 is going
to give us a key for a symbol so when we
come across a symbol and we are not sure
what it is used for we can use this
method to get the description so now I
know that this symbol was actually used
to set up a symbol in the global
registry it's a red symbol okay
now that we know symbol is used to
create a unique ID a good place to use
them or use symbols is in object
properties so we can have a new symbol
let F name is equal to symbol and then
we can create a new object that person
is equal to
and by using the bracket notation we can
use the symbol over here F name as the
property so f name : Chandler as the
name excuse me
so now we have created a unique property
inside this object so we never have to
worry about our code conflicting with
existing methods or being accidentally
overwritten
because this property is always going to
be unique and the the last thing I would
like to point out is that when we try to
lock the console object dot get on
property names and past person okay let
me change this to person and when I save
this we don't get this property first
name listed out because it is in fact a
symbol so we need to use another static
method which is now present in es6
namely get own property symbols so
instead of names symbols and let's save
this and there you go
symbol and if I pass let's say first
name and save this there you go symbol
or first name so this is the new static
method in es6 which we can use to list
the symbols used for an object so that's
pretty much it about the basics of
symbol thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
