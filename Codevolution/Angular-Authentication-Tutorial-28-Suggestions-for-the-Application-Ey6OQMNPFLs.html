watching some of the videos you were
thinking can I improve this or should we
not take care of this scenario as well
and so on like I mentioned in the very
beginning I really wanted to keep the
application simple while still
explaining the concepts that were
necessary there is always room for
improvement so let me list a few things
that I think you should work on to
better your understanding of what you've
learned in the series first is
encrypting the password make sure you
don't store the password as plain text
in your database encrypted and decrypted
second whenever you return user details
make sure you do not return the password
field it definitely is not necessary for
the front-end we were returning the
password initially in the series but
then of course we started returning just
the token a point to keep in mind for
future applications next improve
registration right now we don't check if
the email already exists in the database
but make sure to check and return an
appropriate response which brings us to
error handling add error handling most
of the places we just log to the console
what the error is instead add a catch
error block throw it to the component
and display an appropriate error message
in the view so that the user understands
what is going wrong next is not so much
as an improvement as it is adding
functionality to understand better how
authentication works so add a new view
where registered users can create a new
event and submitted let the events be
stored in the database instead of being
hard-coded at another view which
displays all the events created by that
specific user if you remember well we
were adding the user ID as the payload
to the JSON web token this is where it
comes to use create an
API that fetches all the events created
by the logged in user ID
all right so there's tons more
improvements you can make but I will
leave it up to you to decide anyway
thank you guys for watching and hope you
found the series to be useful make sure
to LIKE comment and subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
