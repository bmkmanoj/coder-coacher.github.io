server module so I just first create a
file called savages so file new file
save server yes now we've already seen
how to implement a basic HTTP server so
the first line is going to be requiring
the module so very well HTTP is equal to
require and then AC DB now we call the
create server function of the HTTP
module so it's DP dot create server and
this returns an object which has a
method call listen which specifies the
port number so we're going to be
listening on port 80 8 8 8 so we have
created the server that does nothing
let's go ahead and see how to listen to
request
so in our create server function we can
specify an anonymous function the
function request response then first
line is going to be response dot write
head we are going to be telling the
status was ok so state is 200 and then
an object which specifies the content
type sorry about that
content type is going to be text slash
plain and then we are going to your
response dot right hello from our
application then response dot and
so nothing new so far we've already seen
this in one of the previous videos so
save it open
come on front and then type node server
done is this going to start if you go to
your browser
it's DDP localhost 8080 date so we got
the response hello from our application
pretty good now one thing is writing the
code for the server but the second thing
is understanding why we write code in
this particular way and that's very
important the reason is that we don't
want no js' to start the server start
the server and then just pause the
execution doing nothing until the next
request arrives we also don't want the
scenario where we accept a second
request only when the first request is
completed we want to make use of the
asynchronous event even model using this
callback functions in node.js so by
making use of this function here it is
going to respond only when a request
arrives and when there is no request it
is just going to continue executing the
remaining part of the code so let me
show what I mean by that if I add a line
so let's say console dot log and request
received and then after the after
creating the server let's say console
dot log server started on local first
poured a delayed now go ahead and save
it
let me go back and execute all right let
me restart my ctrl C and then node
server yes then we get service started
on localhost 8080 and when we refresh or
we when we make a request it says
request received now the second request
received is actually a request for the
fav icon you can ignore this for now
we are not really bothered about it so
just consider the one request received
so what happens here is that we are
telling no chairs when only there is a
request to the server then respond with
data if there is no request you can
continue executing other code which is
what we want we don't want a server to
be created waiting for a request locking
the execution of the remaining part of
the code so that's how you create a
server and why you wrote while you write
code in this particular fashion using
functions callback functions but let's
try to keep this in a and let's try to
keep our server creation in a single
line so let let me just refactor it so
remove this function and let's say on
request and then let's create our
function so function on on request and
this is going to be passed on to our
create server function so save it and
then if we execute no server so we have
started on am now started on Cordina
dated when we refresh it we get the
request received so that's how you
create a server and in the next video
let us see how to organize our code of
it thank you for watching don't forget
to subscribe if you're enjoying the
videos please leave a comment and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
