we are going to be learning about
classes in es2015 now to define a new
class or use the class keyword followed
by name of the class so class keyword
followed by name of the class and then
of course we have the curly braces and
once we have a class we can have an
instance using the new keyword so let P
equals new person okay so when you try
to log type of class so type of person
let's see what that would put this it's
a function so classes are in fact just
special functions but the only
difference is that classes unlike
functions are not wasted let's see what
I mean by that so let's have a new
function so function employee and then
let's try to call that function now so
let's save this have a look at our
console works good now let me try to
call this function even before the
declaration so save this console no
errors again so let's see the same
scenario with the class so we have a
class person now let me try to call or
instantiate this person even before it
is declared that p1 equals new person
now when I save this there you go we
have an error person is not a
constructor so classes are just very
much similar to functions except that
they are not hoisted so let me pull two
functions away and let me remove this
and let me also remove this okay so now
consider a method inside a class so
let's have a greet method and now what
we are going to do is try to console.log
P dot agreed and let's triple equal that
to person dot prototype sorry but then
person dot prototype dot greet save this
if you have a look at the console it
says true so adding a method to the
class is the same as adding a method to
the prototype object so if you're good
with JavaScript you should be able to
understand about the prototype so
therefore what I would like to imply is
that the class syntax is not introducing
a new object model to JavaScript it's
only a syntactical sugar to the existing
prototype based inheritance so we'll see
more about classes in the coming videos
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
