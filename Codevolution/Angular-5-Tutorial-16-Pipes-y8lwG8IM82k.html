about pipes in angular pipes allow us to
transform data before displaying them in
the view let's take a look at some of
the built-in pipes with examples and
let's begin with the different pipes
applicable on a string type property now
I have created a public name property
and set it to code evolution and I've
bound it to the template using
interpolation so in the browser right
now we just have code evolution
now the first pipe we have is the
lowercase pipe which converts a string
to its lowercase representation so we
have name followed by the pipe operator
followed by the lowercase pipe so now if
we take a look at the browser you can
see code evolution all in lowercase
similarly we also have an uppercase pipe
so instead of lowercase if I change this
to uppercase code evolution will now be
displayed in uppercase next we have a
title kiss pipe as well so I'm going to
create a new h2 tag and we are binding
the message property which is welcome to
code evolution so you can see here that
T and C are in lower case and this will
be converted into uppercase for title
case so in title case the first letter
of every word will be capitalized so if
I go back to the browser you can see
that welcome to code evolution is in
title case now you might also want to
display a part of the string in which
case we can make use of the slice pipe
so again we are making use of the name
property and passing it through the
slice pipe now this pipe takes an
argument you specify a colon followed by
a number that indicates from where the
string has to start so for example if I
mentioned 3 this gives you a string that
starts from the index 3 or code
evolution starting from index 3 so if
you take a look at the browser you can
see evolution so in code evolution this
is 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 and this is the third index
so evolution is printed out now you can
also specify a second argument which is
the limit so from 3 I want up to but not
including the 5th index so this is going
to give us the character at position 3 &amp;amp;
4 only so if you take a look at the
browser you can see e and V so this is
3rd and 4th but not including the 5th
letter so that is the slice pipe now we
also have a JSON pipe which gives you a
JSON representation of the object so I
have created an object called person and
let me show you how the JSON pipe works
so we bind person using interpolation
and then pass it through the JSON pipe
so if you now take a look at the browser
you can see the JSON representation of
that particular object first thing John
last name doe so those are some of the
pipes applicable for a string property
type next let's take a look at numbers
for numbers we have the number pipe and
this pipe takes one argument in a
specific format so let me copy paste a
few HTML elements and explain how it
works all right so we have 3 h2 tags and
we are using interpolation we have a
number 5 point 6 7 8 then the pipe
character and then the number pipe now
this number pipe takes in an argument in
a specific format so this is a string
representation so within single codes we
have a digit followed by a dot followed
by a digit again a dash and then a digit
again so what do this time for the first
one is the minimum number of integer
digits this is followed by a dot and
this again is followed by the minimum
number of death
digits a - and the maximum number of
decimal digits so if you take a look at
the first example one point two - three
so I want minimum one digit in the
integer place five okay we've got that
minimum two digits in that decimal place
so six seven okay we've got that and the
maximum number is three digits in the
decimal place so six seven eight so if
you take a look at the browser it is
going to display five point six seven
eight there is no change whatsoever so
let's take a look at the second example
and you can make out the difference in
the integer place we have specified the
minimum digits to be three so we just
have one digit so it is going to append
two digits to this fight it is going to
become zero zero five and we are saying
we need minimum four digits in the
decimal place we currently have only
three so a zero will be appended towards
the right in the decimal place so six
seven eight zero so if you take a look
at the browser it is going to be zero
zero five point six seven eight zero so
that is the second example the third
example we say that we need three digits
in the integer place so this becomes
zero zero five but we need maximum of
only two digits in the decimal place we
have specified two as the upper limit so
six seven eight has to be replaced with
just a two-digit value so in that
scenario
seven eight gets rounded off to six
eight so if we take a look at the
browser you can see that zero zero five
point six eight so this is how the
number pipe words we have a specific
format with which you can vary the
number of digits that you want to
display in the template alright next we
also have a person pipe and this is
pretty straightforward so we have a
number point two five the pipe character
followed by the person pipe so if you
take a look at the browser it gives the
percentage representation of the number
point two five is 25%
next we also have a currency pipe so you
might want to display prices for your
products in which case we can use the
currency pipe so let me show you a few
examples of the currency pipe so I've
created a new h2 tag again the number is
0.25 but this time I'm passing it
through the currency pipe so if I save
this and go take a look at the browser
it says 0.25 dollars now by default the
currency is US dollars but you can also
specify the country as an argument for
example I'm going to specify that the
currency has to be Great Britain pounds
so the code is GBP so if you take a look
at the browser
it says 0.25 pounds now you can take a
look at the iso currency codes to get
the string representation for all the
countries that you are looking for now
if you take a look at the browser
it shows the currency symbol but if you
want the currency code itself and not
the symbol then you can pass a third
argument so I'm gonna put a colon again
and then I'm going to say code so if you
take a look at the browser
it says GBP 0.25 and the same way if I
change GBP to euros so EU are it says
euros 0.25 all right so that is some of
the pipes that you can apply to numbers
finally we have the date pipe to work
with different date formats so I'm going
to create a new property
public date is equal to new date and
then let's bind it to our template now
if I save this and take a look at the
browser you can see the date now this is
something we cannot really use in our
application so let me go over a few
formats the first one is a short date
format so I'm going to add the pipe
character date pipe colon followed by
the format so this is going to be a
short format so if I take a look at the
browser it says 12 3 17 9 49 p.m. and
similarly if you want only the date and
only the time we can also do that as
well so instead of just sharp I can have
short date and short time so now if we
save this and take a look at the browser
you can see that we get just the date or
just the time now similar to the short
format there is also medium and long so
you can have medium medium date medium
time long dead and long time as well the
usage is same so I'm not going to go
over all of them
I recommend you take a look at the
official documentation and pick the
format that suits your application needs
so that is about the date pipe but one
key point to remember about pipes is
that the pipe operator transforms the
data only for the view it does not
change the value of the property in the
class well alright then that is about
built in pipes in angular thank you guys
