middleware to verify the JSON web token
a middleware is nothing but a function
that gets executed before the
user-defined handler is executed so
let's create a verify token middleware
in the backend
open the file API GS and over here let's
create a new function verify token the
function has access to the request
response and next within the function
the first check we make is whether the
authorization key is present as part of
the header so if not of request dot
headers dot authorization which means to
say if it is not present we return a 401
status with the message that the request
is unauthorized
so res dot status of 401 dot send
unauthorized requests next if the
authorization property is present let's
extract the token value from the bearer
token so let token is equal to request
dot headers dot authorization dot split
on a space and then we are going to
extract only the first index so what is
happening here is we split on the space
which results into an array with the
string bearer in the 0th index and the
actual token in the first index so the
token variable is going to contain the
actual token value now it might so
happen that the token is not present so
we check if it's not a null string not
an object it will be a string if token
is null we send the response that it is
again on authorized if the token is in
fact present we verify the token using
the JSON web token
so let payload is equal to dot dot
verify we passing the token and then the
secret key this is the string secret key
the verify method returns the decoded
token only if it is valid so if the
token is invalid it implies that there
is no payload in which case we again
return a 401 status so if there is no
payload return status of 401
unauthorized request however if all the
conditions pass we assign the payload
subject as the request user ID and then
pass on the execution to the next
handler so request dot user ID is equal
to payload dot subject then we call next
all right that's pretty much our
middleware let's add it to the special
events route
so in router dot get special events the
second argument is going to be the
middle well verify token so what happens
is that when we make a request to the
special events route first the token is
verified and only then the code in this
particular API gets executed so if a
user tries to send an invalid token the
API code does not even get executed the
middleware responds on its own with a
401 status all right now that the
middleware is done let's head back to
the front end and handle the 401 status
code so open special events dot TS and
instead of logging to the console the
error let's handle it better if error is
an instance of HTTP error response and
if error dot status is equal to 401
which is sent from the server we are
going to redirect to the login rod for
which we need angular's router so
first imported and then injected and
just to quickly pointed out HTTP error
response was automatically imported
right now we are going to redirect to
this dot router dot navigate link
parameters array the login route so if
the verification failed in the back end
the front end will navigate to the login
component instead of a special events
component let's save this and test it
out in the browser so make sure to
restart your node server node server
before going to the browser I'm going to
open routing module and over here I'm
going to comment out they can activate
guard for now this way we can make sure
that we are verifying the token in the
backend and the odd guard is not
preventing sending the request to
special events now in the browser go to
the application panel and over here you
can see that we don't have any token
that is set now if I try to navigate to
the members out we get redirected back
to login if you check the console you
should have a 401 on authorized error
so our verify token middleware is
checking to see if a token is present if
it is not present it is returning a 401
status if I do login though so let's go
with a at a comm and then the password
of a and login we should now have the
token said and now we should be able to
navigate to the members route there you
go all right let me enable the
authentication guard again and we should
be good our authentication is now
complete we have an odd guard to check
for the token in the front-end and we
have a verify token middleware in the
backend to check if a token is valid or
not alright here is an exercise for you
all try changing the value
of the token to an invalid token and
submit the request you should get a job
Malcolm exception with a 500 status so
try to replicate the scenario and how to
handle that exception in the next video
let's finish the application with some
UI logic for a logout button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
