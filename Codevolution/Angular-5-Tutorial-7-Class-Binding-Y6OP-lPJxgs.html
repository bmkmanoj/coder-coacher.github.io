take a look at binding classes to HTML
elements in angular now to get us
started I've created a few classes a
text success class that has a font color
of green a text danger class that has a
font color of red and a text special
class that has a font style of italics
and in the template I have an h2 tag
that says code evolution now the regular
way to apply a class to this element is
using the class attribute so we can say
plus is equal to text success and if you
take a look at the browser code
evolution is now in green font color to
use flash binding however we need to
declare a new property and assign to it
the class name so in the test component
class I'm going to create a new property
I'm going to call this success class and
assign to it
text success then in our template we can
use the square bracket syntax to bind
the class so create a new each to tag
with code evolution as the text and then
we are going to have class within square
brackets and to this assign success
class property now if we take a look at
the browser you can see that the result
is the same we have code evolution in
green color but what happens when we use
both a class attribute and the class
binding in the same HTML element let's
take a look I'm going to create another
h2 element and add a class of text
special and a class binding to the
success class property now if you save
this and take a look at the browser you
can see that the text is in green but it
is not in italics
so a regular class attribute becomes a
dummy attribute in the presence of class
binding you have to use one or the other
but not both
right there is another syntax to class
binding and what this syntax does is
apply a class based on an expression
that evaluates to be either true or
false let's take a look at an example
I'm going to create another h2 tag and
I'm gonna create a new property as well
I'm going to name this has error and set
it to true now I want to apply the text
danger class to this h2 element based on
whether this has other property is true
or false for that the syntax is within
square brackets class followed by a dot
followed by the name of the class that
we want to conditionally apply in our
case it is text danger and to this we
assign an expression that evaluates to
true or false so this is going to be has
error property right now has error is
true which means the text danger class
will be applied to the element so if we
take a look at the browser you can see
that the text is in red so it is
possible to toggle the text danger class
by changing the value of this has error
property so if I change hazard to false
you can see that the text danger class
will no longer be applied and code
evolution is in black color and this
works fine when we want to conditionally
apply a single class but if you want to
conditionally apply multiple classes
angular provides us with the ng class
directive now a directive is nothing but
a custom HTML attribute that angular
provides so let's take a look at an
example now to use this ng class
directive let's begin by adding new
properties to our component class so I'm
gonna add public is special and set it
to true and I'm also going to add an
object and this is going to be message
classes we are going to have text
which is a class that we have defined
and this is going to be not of this dot
has error text danger class and this is
going to be set to this dot has error
and finally text special class that is
set to this dot is special and then in
our template we are going to add a new
h2 element and we are going to use the
ng class directive the syntax is within
square brackets you use the keyword in G
class and to this you bind an object so
this is going to be message classes
object that we have just created so what
happens is that angular identifies
message classes has to be applied to
this element in the object it checks
which classes are set to true right now
has error is false so not of this dot
has error is true so text success class
will be applied is special is also true
so text special class will also be
applied so if you take a look at the
browser code evolution at the very end
is in green and italics and if i set has
error to true the browser is going to
refresh text danger gets applied and the
message is now in red and italics so
class binding is really useful because
it allows you to dynamically add or
remove classes to HTML elements based on
certain user interactions or state of
your application you can change the
classes being applied by changing the
properties in your component class
alright with that let's take a look at
style binding in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
