previous video will let have to use the
anchor tag to to link two different web
pages now in some scenarios for example
when a web page has really long content
that is favorable to create links within
the web page so what we do is create
some kind of a bookmark using an
attribute called ID and this bookmark is
just like how you have a bookmark when
reading a novel now we don't want to go
through one page up to the other you
just keep a bookmark and then when you
come back the next time you can directly
go to the page where you left off last
time so I have created I have edited the
above Chandler web page so about
Chandler web page using the content from
the wikipedia page so that we have lots
of content that is crawlable so let's
say we want to read about his career now
what we don't want is to scroll all the
way just to read this instead we are
going to create a bookmark for the
courier tag so enchanted on HTML if you
scroll down all the way we have the
carrier over here which is surrounded by
the h2 tag so to create a bookmark we
are going to make use of the ID
attribute so let's say let's give it an
ID so ID is equal to well since it's
about the career let's say career and n
are and that's at the top we can say
after back to friends we can create
another anchor tag so and this time
instead of specifying an HTML file as a
link we are going to specify that
bookmark or the ID but it has to be
proceeded with the hash sign so put a
hash and then courier as the ID and
between the two opening and closing
anchor tag you can type career
Chandler's career okay let's go with
Chandler's career the Chandler's career
when we go ahead and save it and reload
this file go to the top we have a link
called shonda's career right when I
click on that we are taken to this
carrier pretty neat now if you want to
link if you want to link to a particular
ID or a bookmark from a different page
so let's say we have our index dot HTML
and we create another link called a and
then an anchor tag now this is going to
be Chandler dot HTML and then career so
you specify the link where this ID is
present so channel dot HTML then put a
hash sign and then the ID value so which
is carrier and then we can go ahead and
type Chandler's career save it and
reload it let's go back to our friends
so Chandler's career and it takes us
straight to the career so that's it
about links at least the basics of it
and if you guys have any questions leave
a comment and leave a comment below so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
