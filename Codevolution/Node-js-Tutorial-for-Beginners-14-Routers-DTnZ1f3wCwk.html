example tutorial now consider a
restaurant and we have a few tables on
the restaurant then there's this guy
usually at the door who greets the
customers not really sure if he has a
name but if you guys know what his goal
then please leave a comment anyway so
what he does yes
let's say a customer walks in and says
table for two please
then this guy takes them to the table
that has two seats now let's say the
next customer walks in and says table
for four please
then this guy again takes the customer
to a table that has four seats and let's
say a third customer walks in and say
it's table for eight please then the
customer is taken to a table which has
eight seats by this particular guy so
depending on what table the customer
requested for this guy right here takes
them to the appropriate place now in our
node.js world this guy right here is
going to be a router module so depending
on which URL the user requested from the
server the router module decides how to
react to it so to create a router module
we need two things the first one is the
request URL the second one is the get or
post parameters now remember the request
object we pass while creating a server
well this information can we extract
extracted from that request object and
but for example if we had this
particular let's say HTTP Lucas a
deleted slash whole question mark
channel equals statement then this whole
is going to be our path and then this
channel equals joke bond is going to be
a parameter but we need to interpret
this information from the request object
so we will be using two additional
modules the first one is called a URL
module the
second one as the query string module so
enough of chitchat let's start coding a
router GS module so going back to our ab
dot chairs we first let's sorry going
back to your server yes we need to first
figure out the URL path that was
requested to the server so in our server
dot yes we are going to be requiring a
new module so very well URL is equal to
require this is going to be a core
module so just URL now we within the
function we are going to say variable
path name is equal to the URL module
cache method and we are going to be
passing the request objects URL so
request dot URL and then we are going to
be extracting the path name and in our
console dot log let's say request
received for and then happening all
right now you can go ahead and save it
and now let's create a router module so
file and save it as router dot j/s and
in a right ogs let's just have a basic
function let's say function route and
let's pass the path name let's pass the
path name where we are going to route
and let's just log for now that routing
a request for this pat-pat name
all right and then let's go ahead and
export this function so experts dot rad
is equal to route excuse me fair enough
now a server now our server needs to be
aware of this router module so we need
to inject this dependency by the way
I've got a video on dependencies and the
angularjs series you might want to check
that out so anyway to create this
dependency route is going to be passed
as a parameter to our start server
function so let's say route and then
once we have received the request for
that particular path name
let's route it so route of paddling
we're wait a minute how does the server
know about route so how well are we
specifying this route so let's go back
to our app dot yes and let's require our
router module so variable router is
equal to require but since it is created
by us dot slash router and then to your
start server function we are going to be
passing router dot route so what we have
done here is we have our app dot GS
which is the entry point we are going to
call server dot start server using and
by passing this route method now in a
server yes this route is going to be
passed and by calling this route with
path name it is actually going to say
routing a request for the particular
path name so let me save it router
Dodgers let me save server Dodgers let
me save AB Dodgers
let's go ahead and open a command window
here and when we type node at dart Jess
let me quick okay all right I already
have a server running sorry about that
so let's say no I've got Jess and it's a
service started on localhost port 8080
and when we go back to our browser and
refresh and if you have a look at that
command window it says request received
for the home page and then request
receipt for fav icon that so this the
favicon request I was talking about
which we are going to ignore so
if we change our if you change a t-888
to slash hole then it's going to say
requests received for hole so so far we
have created a router which can
distinguish between the URLs that the
server was requested for and in the next
video let us see how to handle this
particular URL request so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget subscribe
I'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
