us see what are the different things
that we need to start building our
building our angular application the
first thing you have to do is download
and install node now node comes with a
tool called NPM or node package manager
and this tool is basically required to
install all the dependencies or modules
and start our server and so on so go
ahead and download and install the
appropriate version of node for your
machine and that should also install NPM
for you the next thing we need is an IDE
or a text editor for this video series I
am going to be making use of Visual
Studio code which I found very helpful
but feel free to use webstorm or atom or
sublime or even notepad plus plus
anything of your choice to be honest
alright now for some good news and some
bad news the mad the bad news is that
even the simplest of angular
applications require a lot of files and
configuration it is not like an HTML 4h
HTML file where you save a file with dot
HTML extension and you're good to go no
but the good news is that I have all the
required files in my github repo so that
you can download and get started and the
link is going to be in the description
so go ahead and download it and you're
going to have a template folder with you
now the last thing to do is install all
the dependencies for our application so
navigate within the template folder and
open get ok you can use command prompt
or git bash now type NPM install
now this is going to install all the
dependencies and the directory structure
will be complete now this is going to be
quite time-consuming so I'm going to end
this video right here so that I don't
have to take you through the entire
installation but if you are done with no
NPM errors I think you should be good to
go so in the next video let us
understand the directory structure and
begin with our hello world application
so thank you guys for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
