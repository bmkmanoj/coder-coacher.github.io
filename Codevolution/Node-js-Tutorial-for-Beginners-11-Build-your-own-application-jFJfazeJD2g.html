number 11 of our no J series now it's
time to finally build our very own
node.js application I figured it's
better to learn a few concepts of nodejs
by building an application in parallel
but keeping in mind that this series is
for beginners we are going to be
creating a very simple application so
what are we building here we are going
to be building a review application it
does two things
when a user enters the URL localhost a
deleted slash home we are going to be
displaying a review form where the user
can input a review and click on submit
and then when he clicks the submit
button is going to be taken to localhost
eight eight eight eight slash review
where the review is going to be
displayed now even though this can be
achieved with some very basic code we
are going to be diving deeper into
node.js and build the application by
understanding a whole lot of concepts so
how do we go about implementing this
application we are going to be breaking
our application into four parts the
first one is the server and we need we
need a server for the user to make
requests second one is the view now this
view logic is required to display the
response from the server
third one is routers so routers are
there to handle different requests
depending upon what URL the user is
going to enter in the browser and
finally we need to have request handlers
to fulfill the requests that arrive at
the server and that have been routed
using the router so from the next video
we are going to start implementing each
one of these parts separately and then
combining all the parts to build our
application so thank you guys for
watching and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
