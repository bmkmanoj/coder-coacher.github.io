the routing parameter using the snapshot
approach what this approach has a
limitation so in this video I'm going to
demonstrate what that limitation is and
also how to overcome that limitation now
in our application we always navigate
from the department list component to
the department detail component so let's
improve this and add a previous and Next
button inside our department detail
component so that we can go back and
forth between the different departments
so let's implement the functionality in
our code so over here in department
detail component underneath this h3 tag
I'm going to add two links so angry tag
and the first anger tag is going to say
previous the next one is going to say
next now anytime I click on previous I
need to move to the previous department
and anytime I click on next I need to go
to the next department so what we need
to do is listen to this click event so
we are going to assign a handler and I'm
going to name it as go previous and
similarly for next button I'm going to
listen to click event and I'm going to
assign a handler go next so now before I
define these functions if you remember
whenever we navigate from code we need
to use this router service so this dart
router navigate and then we pass in the
link parameter sorry so let's go ahead
and do the same first thing we need to
do is import the router service from
angular slash router and then inject it
as a dependency in the constructor so
private router of type router so now I
can define go previous and go next
so go previous is the method now what we
need to do here is retrieve the previous
ID and then navigate to it so I'm going
to do let ID I'm going to call this
preview
I D so let previous ID is equal to if
you remember we have this dot Department
ID which we are displaying in the view
and that is going to contain the current
ID so if I subtract one from it I'm
going to get the previous ID so let
previous ID is department ID minus one
and then I'm going to go back here and
then just copy this code this dot router
dot navigate to Department so let me
just move this back and instead of
passing Department ID we are going to
pass in the previous ID now the same
thing I'm going to do with go next
method so I'm going to say instead of go
previous go next and instead of previous
ID we have a next ID and instead of
decrementing we are going to increment
it and we are going to pass this next ID
as the parameter so let's save this and
let's test if our application works so
I'm going to go back here our
application just reloaded if I click on
angular it says you selected with ID
equals one and the same is reflected in
the URL if I click on node ID equals two
and department or in the URL
it saves two but now let me click on
this next button alright I did click on
this button if you did not hear my mouse
click but as you see our application is
not working as expected so let me
analyze the code and explain to you why
it doesn't work so let's start with the
button click now when we click Next the
ID is incremented and then we call
router navigate and we pass in the new
ID so let's let's check if this part of
the code is working so if you have a
look at the URL we did navigate to the
next department but our view logic is
not working which means the ng on it on
init method is not working and let me
explain why now angular is pretty smart
angular is going to create this
department detail component
only if you navigate from some other
component to the department detail
component or in our case from department
list to department detail but angular is
not going to recreate the same component
if you are navigating back to itself or
in our case from department detail back
to department detail so in the first
case ng on in it is going to get called
because the component is created but
when we navigate from department detail
to itself the component is just going to
be reused it is not going to be
recreated and hence ng on init method is
not going to get called again so since
we have this router snapshot in ng on in
it this doesn't get called a doll so
this is the limitation of the snapshot
approach when we are navigating from a
component back to itself and we need to
retrieve this ID or the parameter then
it is going to be a limitation now what
is the solution to this the answer is
the param variable now let me just
comment the NGO in it that we have
already coded so that you can compare
and contrast and let's implement a new
entry on it now anytime we need to
retrieve the parameter we are going to
use the patterns observable so over here
I'm going to say this dot route dot
parents of this patterns if you see here
is going to return an observable
so an observable only sends us data when
we subscribe to it so dot subscribe and
the SUBSCRIBE method is going to take in
an arrow function so the parameter is
going to be patterns and let's strong
type this to be of type patterns so
apart from router
let's also import patterns now this is
going to have the fat arrow syntax and
then the body of the function so over
here I'm going to say let ID is
equal to parse int so that we can
convert from string to an integer
parents of ID and I'm just going to re
explain what this does but let me first
complete the code so this dot Department
ID is equal to ID so this parents
observable is actually capable of
detecting any change to the route
parameter and even when we navigate back
to the same component it can detect that
change so even though ng on in it is
called only once it is fine because this
parent observable can handle the change
so basically the route service gives us
access to all the parameters and that is
going to be returned as app atoms
observable and we are going to subscribe
to it when we subscribe we get all the
parameters and out of all the parameters
we just need the ID parameter we convert
it into an integer and then assign it to
the department ID that we display in our
view so let me save this and now let's
test our application so I'm going to go
to departments I click on angular I get
one I click Next you see the URL is two
and so is the view I click on next three
and three
I go previous two and two so that is how
the params
observable approach is going to overcome
the limitation when you navigate to a
component itself so just to quickly
quickly summarize what we did we added a
previous and Next button within the
detail component so we navigate back to
it but the parameter is going to change
every time now the snapshot approach
cannot handle this so we need the param
subserve allah proach so using the route
or activated route service which we
refer to as route in here we use the
param sub-zero
we subscribe to it we get hold of all
the patterns but then we just filter out
the ID param and then we assign it to
department ID so anytime
you navigate from one component to a
different component you can use the
snapshot approach it's fine but if
you're navigating back to the same
component and and still passing route
parameters then make sure you use the
paradigms observable approach all right
that's pretty much it for this video
thank you guys for watching don't really
subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
