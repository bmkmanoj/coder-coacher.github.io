about the set type which helps us to
manage a list of values but when we need
some sort of an association between
information and values then we need the
map type so in es2015 map as an ordered
list of key value pairs and in maps both
the key and the value can be of any type
unlike objects where the type of the
property is always a string now let's
try to understand about maps and their
methods with a few example few examples
so first up to create a new map we knew
it so let my map is equal to new map now
to add an item we use the set method so
my map dot set and we within parentheses
we specify the key value pair of the key
is going to be first name and the value
is going to be chandler now we can also
have numeric values so my map dot set
age which is 30 I have to retrieve a
value that is set we can use the get
method so my map or in fact let's try to
log this onto the console my map dot get
and we have to pass the key so ethnic
and this is going to retrieve the value
associated with first name so when we go
to the browser and I need to build this
so ctrl shift B ok so we have Chandler
now we can also use objects as keys
within a map so let me create let o be 1
is equal to empty braces let OB 2 is
equal to empty braces and we can have my
map dot set will be 1 and then let's
have a value of 10
and similarly my map dot said OB
two-and-twenty now we can do the same to
retrieve the values so log my map dot
get OB one so when we save this we have
the value 10 now we can use the size
property just like sets to know how many
key value pairs are present in a
particular map so we're here I'm going
to say log my map dot size so right now
we have four key value pairs and there
you go for now the next thing is we can
use the hash method to check if a key
exists in a map so we can say log my map
dot has does it have a key called first
name so when we save this it's going to
return true so if it did not exist it
was going to return false
now we can also have or we also have a
delete method to remove a key value pair
so I'm going to delete this before size
and has so that we can verify if it's
working so my map dot delete and we
specify the key so we're going to delete
first-name
so now when we save this and refresh it
so the number of elements or key value
pairs was reduced by one and we don't
have first name in the map anymore so it
returned false and finally we have a
clear method that removes all the key
value pairs from a map so over here I'm
going to have my map dot clear so when I
save this and we refresh our browser we
are going to have zero elements so
that's pretty much it for this video
thank you guys for watching I'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
