number 16 and in this video we are going
to be learning about forms now let's
consider this example you go to a
hospital for some reason and there you
are given a form to input your details
now if you go to a website let's say
Facebook then you have a registration
form where you have to input your name
email password and then click on a
submit button or let's say in some of
the website you have to enter a feedback
form
so let's say you have to provide your
comments so basically what a form is is
is that a form is used to collect input
from a user now there are two steps when
dealing with forms though and the first
step is to accept input from the user
and then the second step is to process
that input data now in this week in this
video series we are going to be learning
only the first step which is learning
the different ways that we can accept
input from a user with the help of forms
and the second step of processing the
input it calls for some kind of a
scripting language that we have not
learned yet so we are going to be
focusing on only accepting the input
from the user
all right so to create a form to accept
input data we need to use a form tag so
let me just quickly save this file as
let's say form start HTML and let me
quickly remove the h3 tag and the list
okay so to create a form we are going to
be using the form tag now let's say we
want to create a registration form so to
accept any kind of input from the user
we need to include a tag called input
tag now this input tag is going to take
an attribute called type which is going
to decide the way
how we are going to accept the X of the
input from the user
now let's say we want to accept the
username from the user let's say we want
to accept a username so for that we need
to specify the type as text and then we
are going to have to give a name to our
input tag now this name is going to be
used while processing my input but for
now let's let's just say this is you
name now to give a label to this
particular form input let's say this is
going to be user name so that the person
visiting the website or filling this
form knows what exactly the fill inside
if you go ahead and save it let me
quickly open forms on HTML then there
you go you have a label called user name
where you can start typing the user name
so then you can type whatever you want
now there is an additional attribute
where you can specify the size of the
input so the attribute is called size
and if we give it let's say let me give
it three so that you can understand the
difference so when we save it and reload
it you see that the input has been
reduced now it doesn't mean that you can
enter only three characters so ABC you
can still enter as many and it just
keeps scrolling all the way to the right
so if you have to specify a maximum
length for your input then we are going
to need another attribute called max
length so max length is equal to let's
say 5 and then let's remove the size
attribute we don't need that anymore so
when you save it and reload it and I'll
try 1 2 3 4 5 and that's it so it cannot
accept any more inputs now a second type
of input is let's say we want a password
to be entered by the user so let's
create a label for that pass
now once again the input is going to
remain the same the input tag but this
time the type will be equal to password
so password and then once again we're
going to give a name so let's say name
is equal to you pass so username pass
and then save it and reload it so ok let
me just quickly add a break tag I have a
break tag over here save it then
reloaded so you have one password
username and then the password now they
would look the same but check it out
when I type start typing a password it
appears in bullets so it serves the
functionality that a password has to be
hidden so whenever you want to accept a
password from a user you need to specify
the type attribute to be equal to
password anyway so just to quickly
recollect a form is created using a form
tag and to receive input from the user
we use the input tags and let's say if
we want a text input such as a username
or a first name last name we use the
type attribute to be equal to text and a
name is also given to an input tag and
if you want to specify the maximum
length that the user can input then you
use it you do it using the max length
attribute and finally if you want the
user to enter a password then you need
to give the type is equal to password
now in the next video let us understand
how to create radio buttons and
checkboxes so thank you guys for
watching do subscribe and I'll see you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
