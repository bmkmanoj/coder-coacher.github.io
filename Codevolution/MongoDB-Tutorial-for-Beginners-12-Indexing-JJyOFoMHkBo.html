bit about indexing now I think we all
remember our textbooks where the first
few pages were indexed so they would
contain a chapter name and the
corresponding page number so if you had
to find a particular chapter 6 chapter
10 which was on page hundred we could
directly turn over to page 100 we did
not have to go through first of all one
200 just to find that particular chapter
now indexing is something similar and
one way to be as well in the sense that
MongoDB does not have to scan each and
every document when you have an index
present so let's just go through some of
the commands on how indexing works the
first command is do we know employees
dot find dot pretty now we have a list
of documents now let us say we want to
create an index on the email field so
the command is TV the employees don't
insure index and we want to create it on
email one so now okay
we have created the index to check what
are the indexes in our current
collection you can say DB down employees
start get index is dog cat indexes run
this we get two indexes the first one is
ID which is already created by MongoDB
the second one is the email which we
just created now to drop an index just
say TV dot employees dot drop Dex
and email one say okay so when we go
back to get in exes
we just have ID as an index now the
major advantage of indexing as when you
have millions of documents covering the
data is going to take a huge amount of
time and creating an index is going to
reduce it down to a fractions now you
you would not want to create an index of
each in every field and in the document
because then you would just be creating
recreating the document itself so you
would want to create an index on the
fields that you think are going to be
unique in the document for example an
email id or a username or an employee ID
and on this basis so that's it about
indexes thank you for watching and I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
