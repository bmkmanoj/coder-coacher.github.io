all learnt have to accept input from the
user in various ways but now what do we
do with this input now whenever you want
to submit a form to a file on the server
to process the input we are going to be
using a submit button so to have a
submit button we are going to have an
input but this time the type is going to
be equal to summit and let's say the
value is going to be seven now this
segment is what is going to be appearing
on the button so when you save it and
reload it you have a submit button now
when you click on it nothing happens
right now because here's the thing the
font type the font tag takes an
attribute called action and the value
for this action yes the file on the
server that needs to be where we need to
navigate to to process this input so we
haven't learned any scripting language
but this action usually has something
like a file dot PHP where you take this
input from the form and then process it
in some kind of way and then provide an
output or anything but right now we
haven't learnt all that so we are going
to be having the action attribute set to
blank
save it and when you reload it when you
click on the submit button nothing
happens but just keep in mind that you
need a submit button to submit a form on
to the server now it is also possible to
have a reset button for our form so the
type is going to be reset and the value
let's say why not call it reset again
when you save it reload it you're going
to have a reset but it does nothing
right now but here's the thing when you
provide a lot of input and click on the
reset button it is going to reset all
your input controls so
reset and it all goes back to the
default settings now one final thing is
that it is also possible to have a
button on your form so input type is
equal to button and let's say value is
equal to click me when you save it you
have a button called click me which
absolutely has no use whatsoever but
just keep in mind that it is also
possible to have buttons now this brings
us to the end of forms so a form is used
to accept input from the user and there
are a whole lot of ways in which you can
accept input from the user then we have
a submit button to submit a form we have
a reset button to reset a form and we
also have general buttons which can be
used to trigger some kind of a
JavaScript but anyway we have not learnt
any of those and yep that's it for now
and in the next video we are going to
start learning how to style our web
pages I just remember that we we kind of
ditched our friends web page sorry about
that
but hopefully you can create your own
awesome website with what you've learned
so far in HTML and from the next video
let us see how we can style your web
pages so thank you guys for watching
