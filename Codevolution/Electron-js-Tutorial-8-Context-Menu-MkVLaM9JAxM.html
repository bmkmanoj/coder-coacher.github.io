a context menu and the context menu is
the menu that is visible when you
right-click in your application so let's
see how to create a context menu for the
application that we have been working on
in the last video now for the context
menu let's use a slightly different
approach so we will be using two sub
modules of electron menu and then menu
item so import that second menu item
this equal to electron dot menu item
next we build the context menu so with
an app dot ready and after the code that
we have written in the previous video
I'm going to say Const CTX menu context
menu is equal to new menu and then to
this context menu we are going to append
sub menus so within parentheses new menu
item now this menu item is going to
again take in object so we are going to
specify a label as the key and then as
the value I'm just going to specify
hello right so we have our context menu
and we have added a menu item for that
context menu next we need to attach this
context menu on the right click event in
the browser window and for that we make
use of web contents property of the
browser window so window dot web
contents dot on the event is context -
menu and then we have a function so this
function gets executed this is going to
take two parameters the event and the
parents and we're going to open context
menu dot pop-up is the method is the
method that is used to open the context
menu and in the browser window says will
parents dot X params dot Y so this gives
us a coordinate of where
the right mouse button was clicked now
this web content gives us access to a
lot of events that control the webpage
and for the right-click the event is
context menu and that is why we listen
to this particular event and then this
function of course executes which pops
up the context menu also let me quickly
change this lowercase M to uppercase
because lower case M is not a
constructor so now when we run NPM start
let's test at the context menu works so
I'm going to right click and you can see
that there is hello we get a context
menu so of course right now nothing
happens on this so let's add a click
handler so I'm gonna close this and over
here I'm going to add click and then of
course the function and within the
function I'm just going to log to the
console context menu item plate so now
let's restart our application and if I
right click you can see that there is
the context menu and in the integrated
terminal there's no message right click
click on hello and you can see that
context menu item click is logged in the
console so the functionality is very
similar to the application menu I can
even add roles as part of our new menu
item and that would work for example I'm
going to append a new items a context
menu dot append new menu item and the
role is select all so when I run this
application again NPM start right click
you should see the context menu you can
see that there is hello
which we created so context menu item
click and there is select all as well
which when I click selects all the text
in our browser window so you can
basically have anything like copy paste
and so on as part of your context menu
well that is how you create a context
menu for your application we make use of
menu and menu
item sub-modules and in AB dot on ready
method we are going to have a context
menu which is a new menu and to this
context menu we append new menu items
these menu items are basically sub menus
in your application level so you can
have labeled click roles and so on and
once you have appended all the menu
items on the browser window where you
want to have the context menu you can
say window dot web contents dot on
context menu now this is the event that
is raised when you right click it is
going to give you the event as well as
the parents the parents dot X and parent
dot y gives you the position of your
mouse so that the context menu can pop
up on that particular mouse position in
that particular browser window all right
that is about menu creation in electron
