short hands I must say that can help us
save a few keystrokes when executing
commands now the very first one is
creating a package dot a JSON file with
the default values now the command will
be NPM in it - - yes but then this can
be reduced to NPM in it
- why so this is going to create a
package dot JSON file with the default
values so let me open visual studio code
and if you have a look at the package
JSON file there you go we have the
package JSON file created with the
default values now the second command is
to install a package locally so the
command would be NPM install let's say
lodash now this can be reduced to NPM I
low - so when I run the command low - is
going to be installed locally in the
node modules folder let's have a look
there you go now to save this package
into packages or JSON file the command
would be NPM I lo - - - save but again
this can be reduced to NPM I though - -
upper case s so when I run this command
excuse me the package is going to be
saved in packages on as a dependency so
now we have low - as a dependency in a
package.json file now the next command
to save a package as a dev dependency so
the command would be NPM install install
let's go with moment this time as the
package so - - save - dev so this again
can be reduced to an NPM I moment with -
an uppercase D so this is going to save
moment as a dev dependency in our
package JSON file there we go
we have moment as a dev dependency
now some of the other things you can do
for example the - - global can be
reduced to - G which we have been doing
all along and if you want NPM - -
version can be reduced to NPM - V so
that is going to give us the version of
NPM install but you have a look at some
of the other shorthand notations you can
visit Docs npm JS comm slash missile a
miscellaneous slash config so here you
have the shorthand notations for the
different options
alright so that's pretty much about the
shorthand notations in NPM I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
