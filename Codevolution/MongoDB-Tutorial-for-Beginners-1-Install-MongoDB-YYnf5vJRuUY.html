welcome to a beginner's tutorial series
on MongoDB now in this video we are
going to go ahead and install MongoDB
for Windows now the first thing you want
to do is go to
www.donateyouraccount.com/davidpakmanshow
a 3.0 and go to the bin directory now
here we have
Mongo and Mongo T now Mongo D is a
program that runs in the background and
that allows us to make connections to
the Mongo database and Mongo just Mongo
is the application that lets us execute
our commands for MongoDB now just to
make sure that the installation was
successful we're going to go to command
prompt CMD and we need to navigate to
this directory and then execute Mongo d
now just a shortcut way of doing that
close the command prompt hold your Shift
+ right click and open command window
here
so what this does is opens command
formed in the correct directory
now type Mongo D whoops
now connections okay so the creators of
Mongo D have said that you need to
create a folder DB in a folder data in C
Drive where Monga D is going to store
all its data so let's go to C drive
right click new folder data navigate
inside data and a new folder DV
alright now let's go back to our command
prompt and say mango tea all right so it
says waiting for connections on port two
seven zero one seven so let's go back to
C Program Files Mongo DB server 3.0 and
let's open another command prompt now
this is where we are waiting for
connections on and we cannot type any
more commands and Mongo D so this is
just running in the background waiting
for connections now open a second
command prompt and type Mongo now if you
see here it says connection Apps
accepted from this is my local machine
so one connection is now open and this
is the Mongo shell where we can type our
commands just to confirm our
installation type the command DB and it
says test so test is the database that
MongoDB provides by default and we are
currently using that and we are done
with the installation and I'll see you
in the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
