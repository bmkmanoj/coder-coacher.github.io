video from the database so again let's
continue in API digest and I'm going to
say router dot delete so when you want
to delete a video we make a delete
request so router delete the first
argument again is going to be video
slash : ID so we are going to again
delete a video using its ID the second
argument is again a function that gives
us access to the request and response so
requests and response
now over here within the pair of curly
braces we are going to say console dot
log deleting a video then we are going
to get a hold of the video model and
long list provides another method find
by ID and remove now again over here the
first argument is the ID of the video in
manga database so request dot parents
dot ID
now this ID again is the same ID that
was passed as part of the URL so the
second argument is going to be a
function that is going to give either
and ever or the deleted video so within
the pair of curly braces
the goal is a if there is an error we
are going to say response dot send error
deleting video and if there is no error
so else we are going to response dot
JSON the deleted video all right
pretty much does it for the delete API
let me go over this one more time so we
make a delete request in order to delete
a video and we patent the ID of the
video and then we are going to console
dot log deleting a video and then we are
going to use the find by ID and remove
method that Mongoose provides on this
video model and we pass them the ID
which was passed as part of the URL and
then in the second argument we have a
function that gives us an error or the
deleted video so if there was an error
we are going to just send error deleting
video if there was no error we are going
to send back the deleted video all right
let me restart the server and then we
can go ahead and test this in postman so
node server and then let's go to postman
open a new tab click on delete and then
it is going to be localhost 3,000 slash
API slash video and we need to patent
the ID now this is going to be the same
ID that we worked with in the last two
videos so I'm going to enter the ID and
click on send and this is going to
delete this particular video so updated
description updated URL and updated
title let me go back to the first tab
which makes a get request so we still
have this I'm going to click on send
again and we should have that no more so
we just have one two three and the
fourth video I'm not really sure how
this fourth video made it over here
sometimes delete this anyway so let's
try it again send it and this was the
video that was deleted so when I make a
get request I should have just the three
videos which were inserted in our
initial MongoDB setup so that is how you
create a delete API so hopefully you
understood how to perform create read
update and delete operations with
MongoDB and Express using Mongoose and
hopefully you also learnt how to make
use of postman to test any API in the
next video let's get started with our
angular application thank you guys for
thank you guys for watching and don't
forget subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
