about and the NPM beginner series is
about script and when we run the command
NPM in it
- why it gives us a packet start JSON
file with some scripts now this contains
a simple test script that just echoes
onto the console that no test is
specified now this is not so useful so
let's create a simple script that is
going to start a simple node application
now I have created a PS which is our
simple node application and it is just
going to log to the console NPM script
test now basically what we would do is
execute node and then AB dot yes to run
the application so this is going to log
to the console NPM script test so let's
write a script that is going to do this
for us
so I'm going to go back to package JSON
and I'm going to replace this test with
start and what are we going to do we are
going to execute node fjs so when I save
this and go back to command prompt i can
type NPM start and this in turn is going
to run null objects and hence we have
NPM script test log to the console now
this comes in really handy when you are
developing projects and let's say you
have created a project and the entry
point for the project as a pious so
someone downloads your project from
github and they run node AB dot yes but
later on you decide that the entry point
is going to be index Dodgers now if the
user doesn't know this and when he gets
the latest version and runs the command
node AB Dodgers is going to get an error
so by having a start command the user
doesn't have to worry about what command
to run when you make changes so all they
have to worry about is executing NPM
start and that in turn is going to
execute the appropriate command to start
the application and in fact if you have
a look at angular 2 code
this is the QuickStart application so
they have scripts and they have a start
script as well so when I run npm start
it is going to start the typescript
compiler in watch mode and also run the
NPM Lite server excuse me
so that's basically how you write
scripts and that's pretty much what I
wanted to cover in the NPM beginner
series so I hope you guys enjoyed the
series thank you guys for watching don't
forget to subscribe and until next time
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
