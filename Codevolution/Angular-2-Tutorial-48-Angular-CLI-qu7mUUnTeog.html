have a look at angular CLI now the
angular CLI is a command line interface
tool that is not only going to make
development quicker but also easier so
instead of having to code every line
from scratch the angular CLI can
generate files such as components
directive services or even generate an
entire project with just a single
command
now this video is straightforward we are
going to learn how to create a new
angular project using the CLI and then a
few commands that generate different
files so if you've been having trouble
creating a project then this is the
video to watch the first step is to
install angular CLI globally and the
command for that is NPM install - g for
global flag at angular slash CLI now I
already have the angular CLI installed
so I will not be running this command
you can pause the video and install it
next we can create a new angular project
using the ng new command so NZ followed
by new followed by name of the project
now I'm going to call this project demo
CLI the command takes
couple of minutes to install but what it
does is it is going to create a new
folder with the name demo fairlight and
within the folder it creates all the
necessary files required for a sample
project now to run this project all we
have to do is navigate inside the
project folder so CD demo CD demo CLI
and then we use another command ng serve
followed by - - open now the ng self
command is going to build our app and
launch the server and track file changes
the - - open option is - right away open
the app in a browser on port 4200 and in
the browser it should say app works so
let's wait a couple of seconds and there
you go so our application is now working
now just to understand the folder
structure let's change the app works to
hello world so open the project in
editor of your choice I'm going to use
Visual Studio code and over here we have
the demo CLI project the demo CLI
project is going to contain a source
folder and within the source folder we
are going to have the app folder now
within that folder we are going to have
app dot component PS sorry dot HTML
which actually binds the title from AB
dot component dot years so in AB dot
component is when I change this to hello
world and save it this should
automatically get reflected in the
browser so we should have hello world
now let's have a look at some more
useful commands now the first one is to
create a new component so open go back
to your command prompt I'm going to type
control C and cancel this alright so to
generate a new component the command is
ng followed by G which stands for
generate followed by component since we
want to generate a confidence followed
by name
of the component now this command is
going to create a new folder and within
the folder it creates the HTML CSS and
typescript files so let me go back to
visual studio code and over here with
the lab folder it creates a separate
folder for the component so the test
component the test component is going to
have typescript
HTML and CSS the CSS will be blank the
HTML with just a paragraph tag that says
the component work and then the
typescript files contains the minimum
code for the component to function so we
have the import statement the component
decorator and then of course the class
all this with the help of just a single
command and if you visit AB dot module
dot es it is automatically going to
import test component and also include
it in the declaration array now
similarly you can also create a service
so go back to command prompt and type ng
followed by G which again stands for
generate so this time we need a service
followed by name of the service so let's
call it a test service and this doesn't
create a folder rather in the app folder
it creates the typescript file so if I
go back to visual studio code within
that folder I should not I should now
have test dot service dot es within the
typescript file the code for import the
decorator and the class would be typed
out for you as you see building an
application is going to be easier and
quicker with the help of angular CLI now
there are a couple more commands for
example to generate a directive a class
and interface and so on now leave a link
in the description and you can check
them out so that's pretty much what I
wanted to cover in this video so thank
