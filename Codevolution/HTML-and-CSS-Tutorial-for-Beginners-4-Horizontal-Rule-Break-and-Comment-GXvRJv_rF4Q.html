four of the HTML CSS series now if you
ever want to draw a horizontal line and
your web page so maybe two separate one
paragraph from the other then maybe we
make use of the horizontal rule tag or
the HR tag so let's separate or heading
from the paragraph now after the heading
we need to include the HR tag so H are
but here is an exception now HR tag is
called an open or sorry an empty element
meaning that there is no content that
needs to be specified and hence there is
no closing tag for the HR tag instead
after HR we are going to have the
forward slash and then the greater than
sign so when we go ahead and save it and
reload it and you can see this
horizontal line that runs across your
web page ok pretty good pretty good now
let's combine these two lines into a
single and into a single paragraph
because the kind of go together so why
have two different paragraphs so let me
quickly remove this closing paragraph
tag and then this closing paragraph
opening paragraph tag so when we go
ahead and save it and reload it oh the
second line is back to the first one now
what we don't want is the two lines to
be showing up and a single line now when
we want a break between these two lines
we make use of the brake tag so once
again this break tag is an empty element
so there is no need of any content or
the closing tag so after the first line
I'm going to be including a break tag so
BR for a break tag and then a front
slash and then close it so when we save
it go back to our webpage and
Russian then we have the show revolves
around the second line after the first
line so they are not appearing in the
same particular line now it is also
possible to have this break tag within a
sentence so for example let's say open a
paragraph and then Ross and Rachel were
on then we can have this break tag and
then we can have a break so let's close
the paragraph tag now when we go ahead
and save it and refresh it so it's Ross
and Rachel or on the break so it is
possible to use the brake tag within a
single line as well all right everything
looks good but I don't want this
paragraph to be the scene on the web
page I was just using it as an example
so what I'm going to do is comment out
this paragraph so that it is not
displayed on the browser now to go in
any piece of code we are going to start
with a lesser than sign an exclamation
sign then hyphen hyphen and then where
we want the comment to end we are going
to once again specify and a hyphen
hyphen and then a greater than sign now
this is going to be understood by the
browser as a comment now by commenting
we are not deleting the code from the
file but merely not displaying it on the
browser and leaving comments is a good
thing as it will help others who are
going to be working on the same website
at late at later point of time and it is
very easier to understand code with
comments so anyway let's save this let
me go back to your web page and refresh
that the comment is hidden from the
browser
the way so that's pretty much about the
HR tag the brake tag and then about
comments so thank you guys for watching
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
