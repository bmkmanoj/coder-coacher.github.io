four of the HTML CSS series now if you
ever want to draw a horizontal line on
your web page say maybe to separate one
paragraph from the other then maybe we
make use of the horizontal rule tag or
the HR tag so let's separate our heading
from the paragraph now after the heading
we need to include the HR tag so H R but
here is an exception now HR tag is
called an open or sorry an empty element
meaning that there is no content that
needs to be specified and hence there is
no closing tag for the HR tag instead
after HR we are going to have the
forward slash and then the greater than
sign so when we go ahead and save it and
reload it and you can see this
horizontal line that runs across your
webpage okay pretty good pretty good
now let's combine these two lines into a
single and into a single paragraph
because they kind of go together
so I have two different paragraphs so
let me quickly remove this closing
paragraph tag and then this closing
paragraph opening paragraph tag so let
me go ahead and save it and reload it
oh the second line is back to the first
one now what we don't want is the two
lines to be showing up and a single line
now when we want a break between these
two lines we make use of the break tag
so once again this break tag is an empty
element so there is no need of any
content or the closing tag so after the
first line I'm going to be including a
break tag so BR for a break tag and then
a front slash and then close it so when
we save it go back to our web page and
refresh it
then we have the show revolves around
the second line after the first line so
they are not appearing in the same
particular line now please also possible
to have this break tag within a sentence
so for example let's say open a
paragraph and then Ross and Rachel were
on then we can have this break tag and
then we can have a break so let's close
the paragraph tag now when we go ahead
and save it and refresh it says Ross and
Rachel were on the break so it is
possible to use the break tag within a
single line as well all right everything
looks good but I don't want this
paragraph to be the scene on the webpage
I was just using it as an example so
what I'm going to do is comment out this
paragraph so that it is not displayed on
the browser now to go in any piece of
code we are going to start with a lesser
than sign the exclamation sign then - -
and then where we want the comment to
end we are going to once again specify
and a - - and then a greater than sign
now this is going to be understood by
the browser as a comment okay by
commenting we are not deleting the code
from the file but merely not displaying
it on the browser and leaving comments
is a good thing as it will help others
who are going to be working on the same
web site at late at later point of time
and it is very easier to understand code
with comments so anyway let's save this
let me go back to your web page and
refresh that the comment is hidden from
the browser
the way so that's pretty much about the
HR tag the break tag and then about
comments so thank you guys for watching
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
