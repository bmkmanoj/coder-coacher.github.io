seven now I would say that please
continue watching this video if you have
a fair knowledge of JavaScript closure
and the problem they create when used
inside for loops but if you don't please
feel free to skip to the next video and
revisit this at a later point in time
okay so okay let's get started
let's say we want to display them the
numbers one to five now this can be
easily done with a follow-up so we have
a for loop right variable is equal to 1
I less than or equal to 5 I plus plus
and then we just console dot log I now
let's save this and when the browser is
refreshed we have one two three four
five really simple now let's say we want
to display the numbers after one second
and for that we are going to be making
use of the set timeout function so set
timeout this is going to take two
parameters the first one is going to be
a function so function and the second
parameter is going to be the time so
we're going to pass thousand
milliseconds or one second and this is
going to be inside the function so we
are logging console dot log and this
right here is going to go below set
timeout okay so we are calling set
timeout for everywhere variable I equals
one to five and we're going to log on to
the console after one second
so let's save this and see what happens
now you see that the output is 6 and
that is repeated four five times
we usually expect the output to be one
two three four five why did we get six
printed out five times now this problem
occurs because we are passing the
reference to the variable I and not the
actual value at the moment inside each
loop so by the time the set timer
function is executed the fourth
statement is already executed and
implemented to the value six which is
when the loop is going to fail or its
exit condition for this volume I equals
six now to achieve the desired result we
need to use an Fe or immediately invoked
function expression however a simple way
which es2015 provides is to use the let
keyword so you can simply replace war
with LED and when you refresh it after
one second you have one two three four
five which is the desired result
so while dealing with closures in loops
please make use of lead keyword it is
very important and it's completely fine
if you didn't follow this particular C
particular tutorial you can you can go
back to JavaScript read about closures
read about a fees or immediately invoked
function expressions and then come back
to this video so thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
