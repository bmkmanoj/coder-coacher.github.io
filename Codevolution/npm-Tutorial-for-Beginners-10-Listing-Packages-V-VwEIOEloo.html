look at the list of globally and locally
installed packages and to list the
packages that are locally installed we
used the NPM list command now I have two
packages locally installed light server
and low - and when I run NPM list it is
going to display the packages in a tree
like structure which also shows the
packages that are installed package
depends on so if I scroll to the top you
can have a look at light server this
light server package in turn depends on
this browsersync package which in turn
has some dependencies and if I scroll
all the way to the bottom
we should have low - and low - doesn't
depend on anything else now we can also
restrict the depth of this tree using
the - - depth flag so NPM list - - depth
and if I specify a depth of one it is
going to give me the immediate immediate
dependencies of light server the light
server depends on browsersync
connect history connect logger and
minimus and low - doesn't depend on
anything and if I specify a depth of
zero it is just going to list all the
packages and no dependencies for that
particular package so what are the
packages in our project this light
server and low - now similarly to list
the global packages we're going to use
NPM list but this time - - global is
going to be set to true and let's
specify the depth of zero again so when
I run this it is going to give me the
list of packages that I have installed
globally so I have light server
installed globally
I have NPM install globally and then
typescript installed globally and if you
have a look at the path here it's going
to be in users which was AB data roaming
and and then in this NPM folder so if I
go over to this particular folder see
users which was AB data - this app data
is a hidden folder then with an AB data
roaming and p.m. and the
the snowed modules folder again here is
where our globally installed packages
are going to reside so that is how you
have or that is have your list the
locally and globally installed packages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
