I want to explain a very important topic
called callback functions and no Jess I
want to state two examples though the
which we which we can all relate to that
will help us in understanding what
callback functions are the first one is
about a package delivery a story about
package delivery as if we have a house
and we have two roommates x and y who
live in that house and they have a
neighborhood called Z now one thing X
tells why
hey why I'm expecting a package in a
couple of hours which is a gift for a
neighbor Z so once you get the package
can you please bring it over to our
neighbors and then in saying so X steps
out of the house and goes to the
neighbor's house now there are two
scenarios that can happen here the first
one is y is going to sit at the door and
wait for the packets to arrive and when
the package arrives Y is going to bring
the package over to the neighbor now a
second scenario or the better scenario
would be for Y to go about doing any
other work he has until the package
arrives and once the package arrives he
can bring it over to the neighbors ed
now another great example would be that
of a restaurant so we have a chef and
assume that this restaurant has single
server when a customer arrives the
server is going to listen to the request
of the customer for their order and then
he's going to the chef and say hey our
customer just ordered a pizza can you
start preparing it let's say that the
chef takes about five minutes to cook
the pizza now once again we have two
scenarios
the first scenario the server is going
to wait for five minutes doing nothing
and once the pizza is prepared the
server is going to bring it back to a
customer not to five minutes
now in the meantime any customer that
arrives would have to wait because our
server is not going to wait for another
customer until the first customer is
catered to now a better scenario would
be for when the first customer arrives
the server is going to take his request
go to the chef and say chef we have an
order for a pizza
but now the server is going to say hey
chef I'm going to go listen to other
customers until the pizza is ready and
once the pizza is ready call me back so
I don't have to wait five minutes so
that I can I don't have to wait five
minutes just to hear the request of
another customer now how do we relate
this to our node.js code now the chef
and the previous slide was like the
database and service still remains the
server and the customer is the user that
makes a request on the browser so what
usually happens is a customer makes a
request to the server suppose let's say
he makes a request for a database
operation so the server goes to the
database and the server is going to wait
five minutes for the data to be
retrieved now in that five minutes
everything else is blocked so even if a
customer - or a customer tweet comes and
makes a request they are not catered to
they are going to have to wait until the
customer one is serviced now this is
something we don't want in a node.js
when a customer one two and three all
appear at the same time they must be
able to make the request to the server
and the server should be able to query
the database and when the data is ready
then the server can deliver the data so
irrespective of how many customers
arrive it is going to take the server
the exact five minutes to to serve all
the customers so let's see how we can
show this using our APIs all right so
let's right
some basic lines of code so console dot
log let's say user one made a request
and then console dot log excuse me Oh
database operation takes five seconds
and then console dot log data deliver to
the user let's just go ahead and make
copies of these and change you the one
to use the two and then I use a three
now go ahead and save it and let's run
it load up Jess what happens here is a
sequential execution so user one makes a
requested break makes a request the
database operation took five seconds and
then the data gets delivered to the user
now the console dot log is pretty quick
so you don't see the delay between any
operation but this is how it's going to
happen user one is going to block and
then user two is going to block and then
finally user three is going to get
serviced now this is something we don't
want or this is what no Jess doesn't
want and the whole purpose of it is to
have asynchronous events or callbacks so
what we are going to do is create a
function let's say function callback and
let's say this callback is going to do
two things for us it is going to query
okay qu queried the query the database
and delivered data and five seconds
excuse me
now we are going to make use instead of
these two console dot log lines let's
make use of our set timeout function now
let's call back our function after five
seconds now we don't have a database
operation right now so we are going to
cheat here and make use of the set
timeout function to delay our execution
so what set timer does is after five
seconds it's going to call this function
called call back so this five seconds
can we map to our database request so
let's say our database operation takes
five seconds and once that five seconds
is up I know that the data is going to
be ready so call this function now if
you replace this again and save it now
app yes then wait for five seconds
three four five and we have the result
so what's happening here we have a
console dot log user one made a request
but then we have this function callback
so shouldn't this line be executed well
that's the thing because we are delaying
the execution by five seconds or we know
that the database operation is going to
take five seconds we are telling that
continue with execution of the next line
of code
but when the data is ready call back
this function so we are going to have
all our requests made by the tech made
simultaneously without having to block
anything and in five seconds
we can deliver data to all the three
requests so even if we had a hundred
requests we would be delivering data in
just five seconds
so to summarize or to simply hood and to
put in simple words a callback function
as another function that can be passed
that is usually passed as an argument to
another function and it is usually
invoked after some kind of an event and
in our case is going to be five seconds
so that that's it I would call back
functions if you guys have any better
examples that we can relate to please
write it down in the comments I would
love to learn from them and anyway thank
you guys for watching and I'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
