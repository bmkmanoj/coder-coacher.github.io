how to create browser windows from the
main process as well as the renderer
process in this video let's take a
closer look at the browser window itself
now again I have the hello world app
copied into into a new folder and I have
named this as browser window so it has
index.html main digest and package.json
I've just changed a couple of things in
package.json I changed the name to
browser window and in index of HTML I
have changed the title as well as the h1
tag now within the create window
function I'm going to remove the code so
that we can start with the very basic
scenario now the first scenario is a
default browser window so we create a
variable window and then create a new
browser window for that particular
window so if I run this application now
we should get a browser window and by
default electron specifies a width of
800 pixels and the height of 600 pixels
so the second scenario is where you can
specify your own width and height for
the window so let's create a new
variable I'm going to call this
dimension window and let's create a new
browser window for that particular
variable so dimension window is going to
be equal to a new browser window and
within the parenthesis we can specify
the different options for the browser
window now I'm going to specify a width
of 400 and a height of 400 as well so
let's save this and start our
application so now if you have a look we
have the outer window the default window
that is 800 by 600 and we also have our
dimension window which is 400 by 400 now
of course you can increase the height
and width even though you have specified
that explicitly so that is fine but if
you want to restrict your height and
width to a certain number of pixels you
can add in the max height and the max
width property
so we're here I'm going to add max-width
let's give the 600 and also max height
600 so now let's run our application so
we have our dimension window which is
400 by 400 and I can extend it to 600 by
600 so the width is going to be 600
that's about it and then the height is
going to be the full 600 which matches
the before default window now one point
you have to make note of here is how you
close your window so if you choose file
and then exit it exists the application
itself so all the windows close when you
exit if you want to close a particular
window then click on the window menu and
then click on close and only that
particular window will be closed
all right specifying the dimensions is
the second scenario the next scenario is
where we can specify a background color
for our browser window so I'm going to
create another way what I'm going to
call this color window and then this
color window is going to be a new
browser window but this time within the
options we can specify a background
color now you can set basically any hex
code I'm going to set to 2 8b to - all
right let's save this and run our
application and when I run NPM start we
should get a new browser window with the
background color so we have a dark green
let's say for this particular window
this is the color window this is the
dimension window and this is the default
window so let's exit this application
finally the fourth scenario is we can
also create frameless browser windows so
these windows don't have a toolbar or a
border so create another variable I'm
going to call it frameless window
and then I'm going to create a new
browser window out of this frameless
window so frameless windows is equal to
new browser window and let's despised
the option background color I'm going to
give this eight zero zero zero zero zero
and to make this a frameless browser
window we need to specify the option
frame and set it to false so now when I
run the application all right so this
browser window does not have a frame so
no toolbar and also no border as opposed
to this one where you can see that this
has the border and the toolbar so these
are some of the options concerning the
appearance of the browser window when it
comes to the behavior we have a few
options as well so let's exist this and
I'm going to comment out the code so far
all right in electron it is possible to
create parent and child windows by
specifying the parent option let's take
a look at an example I'm going to create
two new variables let parent window and
child window now if the parent window
let's create a new browser window and
then the child window is going to be a
new browser window as well but this time
for the browser window or the child
window we are going to specify an option
that says parent is going to be parent
window so basically this particular
window has a parent and what is the
parent it is the parent window let's
save this and start our application so
NPM start and if you have a look we
should have two browser windows but it
is difficult to identify right away
which is the parent and which is a child
window both the windows have the title
as browser window and this is from
package.json so if I go to package of
JSON you can see that name is browser
window and that is what gets set over
here so let's accept this application
go back to our main Dodgers and what we
can do here is specify a tightly
probability to our browser window so
title is going to be parent and
similarly over here the title is going
to be child now let's start our
application now if you notice the title
we have a child and also the parent now
the rule is electron is that the child
window will always be on top of the
parent window so even if I try to click
on the parent window and try to bring it
to the front it doesn't happen the child
window is always on top I can however
put them side by side and continue to
work with my parent window but sometimes
we would like the user to first complete
some task on the child window like agree
to some terms and conditions before
clicking on the next button in the
parent window so in that scenario we
specify another property namely modal a
modal window is nothing but a child
window that disables the parent window
so you have to specify both the parent
options and the modal options for a
modal window so we have the parent let's
also specify the models and I'm going to
set this to true let's restart our
application and test this out so now we
have our child window and we also have
our parent window in the background and
if you notice if I try to click on the
parent window it doesn't allow me it
says I have to use the child window
before I can move on to the parent
window so if I do a window close and
then I can move on to the parent window
all right so that is about parent and
child
windows in electron the last thing I
want to demo is that a browser window
can open either a remote address or a
local HTML file now we have seen how to
load a local HTML files in the previous
videos so in this video let me show you
how
we can load a remote address in a
browser window so we can type child
window dot load URL github.com all right
now when we run this app we see that the
window is created first so we have the
child window and then there is a slight
delay for the github page to render in
this window now let me run this again in
case you missed it I'm going to close
this run NPM start again the window is
loaded we have a slight delay and then
github page again alright to avoid that
flicker we are going to specify a show
option and set it to false so over here
show and set it to false so for the
child window we are not going to show it
by default instead we are going to
listen to this ready to show event and
then show the child window so this
basically gets fired when the child
window has completed rendering the URL
so now if I run NPM start we have the
parent window and you see that the child
window isn't immediately rendered it
only gets rendered when the kids have
page is rendered within the child window
I'm going to show this again NPM start
we just have the parent window at the
beginning and then the child window
without the flicker so you can see that
github is right away present in the
child window well those are some of the
options that I wanted to teach you guys
but there are about a hundred different
things you can set for a browser window
so I would recommend just going through
the elektron documentation to get a feel
of what the browser window is capable of
doing the document also specifies the
different events on the browser window
so it definitely is helpful all right so
that is about the browser window thank
