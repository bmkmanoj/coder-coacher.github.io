just type NPM help to get help on NPM so
NPM help now this going to show you the
typical usage of NPM so it is NPM
followed by a command name and the list
of commands we can specify a displayed
right here and if you have a look at our
command NPM help this exactly the usage
NPM expects we have just replaced this
command with help which is of course a
command listed here now something a bit
more useful is the - eh option on a
command which gives you the quick help
so let's use it with the install command
because it is probably the most used
command during development so we are
going to type NPM install - H and this
gives you the different ways you can use
NPM install and some of these for
example NPM install and NPM install
package we will be learning about them
in the upcoming videos but for now
remember that there is a - eh option and
you can use that with a command now
another very useful command is the help
search command now what this does is it
is going to allow you to specify some
text and it is going to search the NPM
documentation for that text so let me
show you an example so NPM help - search
and any text you want to so update let's
search for the text update in the NPM
documentation so when I run this it is
going to give me the occurrences of this
update text and if you run this help
command so nvm help update so and as you
see here these are the top hits for the
text update and these are the
corresponding documentation so for
example the first one if I run NPM help
update so NPM help update what it does
is it is going to open up the dock
mutation on your browser and from here
you can learn more about the different
commands so all in all NPM help or the
help on NPM is pretty good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
