number 22 and in this video let's have a
look at some of the built-in validations
for model driven forms now angular
provides a validators class that
supports some built-in validations so
let's go ahead and import that so we're
here in AB component es next to form
control I'm also going to specify
another class called validators and
let's perform the exact same validation
that we did with the template driven
form so over here the first thing we
need to do is make this name field
mandatory so every form control can
accept a second parameter which is the
list of validations for that particular
form control so over here next to
Brandon I'm going to specify a second
parameter and that is going to be
validators dot required so basically now
this name form field is mandatory now in
our HTML let's go back over here we can
add a reference to this input element
let's call this ref name and then I can
specify with the bold tag the different
classes that this input element is going
to have so double curly braces and ref
name dot class name so let's have a look
I'm going to save this and head over to
the browser and there you go form
control ng untouched ng pristine and ng
valid now this is valid because this
right now has a value but let me remove
the value and there you go ng invalid
now this is because the name field has
to have a mandatory input and when it is
blank it is in the invalid state now
again we can make use of these classes
to apply any CSS that we wish to inform
to the user whether the form control is
valid or invalid
so in our ab dot component or TS let's
go ahead and add those tiles again so
Stiles is going to be array in within
square brackets backticks
and the first one I'm going to say let's
see input for every input element with
ng invalid class I'm going to say
boarder left 5 pixel solid red and every
input with ng valid class I'm going to
say order left 5 pixel solid green so
now when I save this and head over to
the browser let's wait for it to refresh
and there you go all of them are right
now valid and if I remove this Brandon
name it becomes an invalid form control
but again this is good but we still need
to display an appropriate message to the
user that tells him what is wrong with
this input control so for that we need
to go back to our HTML form and add a
div tag so I'm going to remove this
class name we don't need that anymore
we understood the purpose of it so over
here I'm going to add a div tag
now this div tag is going to have a
structural directive so this is going to
appear in the Dom only based on a
certain condition now what is the
condition the condition is that it
should have the error raised from the
required validator class so first we
need to first we need a reference to
this input control so user form
dot controls off name and dot has ever
required and I'll explain this in
explain in just a second I'm just going
to add the class as well so plus is
equal to alert alert danger and then I'm
going to say please enter a name so
basically what we are trying to do is we
know that we have a model called user
form and this user form model
as several controls so dot controls and
we are trying to find a control called
name and if this name has an error which
is raised by this required attribute or
required condition only then we are
going to display this Dib tag and what
is it going to contain it's going to
contain please enter a name so let's see
how this works I'm going to save this
let's go back to the browser right now
it's Brandon and when it becomes invalid
it's going to say please enter a name
and when I enter something it goes away
so that is how you display an error
message for a form control now similarly
we can add multiple validations so let's
go back to AB component yes
and we can add validations for minimum
length and maximum length so now this
validator is required or the second
parameter becomes an addict of
validations so over here it's going to
become an array and you can specify the
other validations so validators dot min
length and I need the mid length to be
for and validators dot max length and I
want that to be 10 all right so minimum
length of four characters maximum length
of ten characters so let's also go back
to our component HTML and display the
appropriate message so I'm going to
place this twice and name that has error
min length and has error max length so
let's save this and head over to the
browser so Brandon is valid none of the
validations are messed up I'm going to
remove this it says please enter a name
I'm going to enter three characters so
ABC and it still says please enter name
because I did not change this message
I'm going to say please enter at least
four characters and then over here I'm
going to say name cannot exceed ten
characters
now let's save this go back to the
browser clear the name it's going to say
please enter a name let's enter
something so ABC and it's going to say
please enter at least four characters so
ABCD and it's fine so e f g h i j and 10
characters is still fine h IJ K when I
do a K and say its name cannot exceed 10
characters so now based on the
appropriate error condition we are
displaying the error message all right
and one final validation that I really
want to show is the pattern validation
and I want to show that for the postal
code because it is slightly different
now over here I'm going to add let's see
I'm going to add first in the app
component yes I'm going to say the
postal code now initial value is going
to be null I don't need a default value
but then I'm going to add validators dot
pattern so pattern and what is the
pattern it should be a five digit number
so we're going to start off with a
number that is between one and nine and
then four more numbers that are between
zero and nine so there you go now let's
handle this in our HTML so in our class
form group I'm going to add this div tag
so let me just copy paste it so over
here
but here's so I'm going to say what is
there the pattern matching so postal
code needs format is five digits but
here's how we find the form control so
this entry if user form dot controls but
if you have a look this postal code is
nested inside address and this address
is inside user form so user form dot
controls of address
and this address has controls and the
control that we need is called Finnick
postal code so and the error needs to be
caused by the pattern so when I save
this now and head over to the browser
alright now if I enter one two three it
says postal code format is five digits
so three four five and it is gone and
similarly Brandon if I remove everything
it says please enter a name but again we
can still submit a form even if the form
is in the invalid state so to fix this
just go to the button tag and add the
disabled property so disabled and when
is it disabled when the form is invalid
so this is going to be equal to not of
user form dot valid so when I save this
and refresh and when the user form is
invalid
there you go submit is not clickable
anymore and when I enter something valid
we can submit the form so there is there
you go that's how we perform some of the
basic validations with model-driven
forms and also submit only a valid form
right thank you guys for watching don't
