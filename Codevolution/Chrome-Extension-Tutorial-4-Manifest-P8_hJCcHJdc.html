extension is to write the manifest file
the manifest file is a special file that
contains information about the Chrome
extension and the manifest is a JSON
formatted file and at the bare minimum
the manifest must contain the manifest
version the name of the extension and
the version of the extension so let's
start off with that now I have created a
new folder called Chrome extensions on
my desktop and created a new folder
hello world within that and I have
opened the same hello world with Visual
Studio code now you can choose any
editor of your choice
but for this series I'm going to stick
to Visual Studio code now within the
hello world folder I'm going to create a
new file and name this manifest dot JSON
and within this we start off with a pair
of curly braces the first thing we need
to mention is the manifest version so
manyy
first underscore version and this is
going to be two and the current version
is two and unless google updates it
don't try to change this the next thing
we need to specify is a name for our
extension so I'm going to I'm just going
to name this as hello world and need to
specify a version for our extension so
version is going to be 1.0 this needs to
be in codes as well so 1.0 now if you
make any changes to the extension you
can release it to the Chrome Web Store
with version 1.1 1.2 2.0 2.1 and so on
I'm ensuring what new features are the
what what the changes were now these are
the basic necessities for the manifest
file and after this we can optionally
have a description for our extension so
description it's valid right description
here and this is going to be hello world
extension that's a
and we can also specify the icons that
represent our extension and the toolbar
or in the web store and google
recommends that we provide three icons
of different sizes namely 128 by 128 48
by 48 and 16 by 16 so that it can choose
the right icon depending on where it has
to display our extension so we're going
to specify icons and this is going to be
an object so if it is 128 we are going
to specify that our icon 128 dot PNG and
we don't have this extensions right now
but I will create them in the next video
maybe so once we need by 128 we also
need to specify an icon for 48 by 48 so
we'll just have this ice icon 48 dot PNG
and we also need to have a 16 by 16 icon
so if the dimension is 16 by 16 we are
going to instruct it to use icons 16 dot
PNG okay now the next step or the final
step we need to specify that our
extension is a browser action extension
so blink codes we say browser underscore
action which is going to instruct to
chrome that our extension is a browser
action extension and this is going to
have a default icon and we're going to
have this to be icon 16 dot PNG
basically what the icon is going to show
up in the toolbar and we are also going
to have a default pop-up so when you
click on our extension what should be
the pop-up and this is going to be an
HTML file pop-up dot HTML and that's
pretty much it we have our manifest
ready for loading our extension so in
the next video let us create the
papa HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
