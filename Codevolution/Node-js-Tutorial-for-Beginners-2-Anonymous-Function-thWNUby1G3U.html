learn a very first concept and no dress
that we are going to be making use of a
lot let's start let's start by talking
about what functions excuse me
now create a new file and save it as AB
dot yes now we have seen functions in
JavaScript such as let's say we have a
new function called function when stuff
it takes stuff as a parameter and then
let's just type console dot log stuff
now of course we're going to call print
stuff sorry to print stuff
let's pass hello world so all we have
done let's create a function called
print stuff which takes a parameter that
is going to be logged on to your console
so save it and open command prompt and
type node address now this type hello
world so nothing new here right well
guess what in JavaScript we can also
pass functions as arguments to other
functions so let's say we have another
function called main function and this
main function can take another function
as a parameter and it can also take some
value now we can call this function
which was passed in our main function
so another function and we can use the
value because it is local to this
function now so now instead of having to
called printf hello world we can call
main function and
bring stuff and then hello world let's
just say hello so copy
sorry semicolon remove this print stuff
save it now if you run node address it
says hello
how does this work so we have the
execution begins by calling the main
function now we're going to use this
print stuff as another function which we
are passing as a parameter and this
hello is going to be a value so another
function of value is going to get
translated and to print stuff with hello
as the parameter so since we are calling
print stuff it goes to this function and
then locks logs the string hello onto
our console pretty cool right now here's
a new thing in JavaScript it is also
possible to assign a function to
variables so instead of having function
print step print stuff we can have a
variable called print stuff and we can
assign to this variable a function that
takes stuff as a parameter and then
console dot log stuff now if you remove
this function print stuff save it let's
just change hello to wold save it once
again now if you type known AB dot yes
we get the output world so in JavaScript
it's possible to have a function that
doesn't have a name but we can assign it
to a variable and this function that
doesn't have a name it's called an
anonymous function and please remember
this because this is going to be used a
lot and no Jess no Jess we can also pass
an intern anonymous function
a parameter so instead of having to
create an anonymous function assign it
to a variable and then pass that
variable to our main function we can do
we can just do this so we have our
function copy it and replace print stuff
with that so we have our main function
let me just pull it all until one line
it's a bit more easier to understand so
instead of having to call avaible we
have actually defined the entire
function as a parameter to our main
function so what happens now again I
said this world is going to be passed as
stuff over here and then that is going
to be logged onto your console so I have
changed it to joke Mon and let's just
remove variable print stuff go ahead and
save it and if you run it we get Jomon
pretty great right
so just to recollect a note s or
JavaScript it is possible to pass a
function as an argument to another
function it is also possible to have
functions that have no names and they're
called anonymous functions and it is
also possible to pass anonymous
functions sorry it can it is also
possible to define an anonymous function
as a parameter to another function so
that's pretty much our very first
concept thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
