videos from the database to start off I
need to import the video model that was
created so we're here in video GL we are
exporting the video model so let's go
ahead and import it in API J's so cons
video is equal to require now I need to
go up one folder so dot dot dash and
then models and then video so video
digest is the file that contains our
model now before I begin let me tell you
that there is no concept as such behind
what I'm about to type you have to
understand the syntax that Mangal
provides to perform the crud operations
well of course
explain the syntax now the first api is
to handle a get request that is to read
data from the database so we're here
when we have a get request and instead
of just a forward slash we're going to
have a get request for videos now this
is going to have again a function that
gives us access to the request and
response over here first just be on the
safer side and have a look at the
console you can say get requests for all
videos and then video is the model that
we now have access to so const video
gives us the video model so mongols
provide video dot find method now over
here in sight i just specify empty curly
braces because we don't have a search
criteria alright so video dot find and
then recall the exact method and this
again takes a function of this function
gives us error as well as the videos
that are retrieved from the database
now over here within the pair of curly
braces
if there is some error then you can log
to the console ever retrieving videos
and if there was no error so I got that
else we can say response dot JSON the
videos now what is happening here is
that we make the get request to
localhost 3000 slash API slash videos
and we get access to the request as well
as the response now Mongoose provide a
find method on the video model and the
video model is connected to the videos
collection in the video player database
now once we find all the videos we are
going to execute another method and over
here if there is an error we are going
to console.log it and if the videos were
actually returned then we are going to
send it as a response to the browser so
the list of videos I'm going to save
this and to test it let's go back over
here look close : 3000 slash API slash
videos now of course I need to restart
my server so we're here I'm going to
ctrl C and then node node server we're
going to restart the server and then
sorry about that slash videos now if you
have a look we get a JSON array I should
have a an ID for the video a description
for the video a URL for the video who
are here and also the title that we
specified now there are three documents
over here so all the three documents
were the documents that we inserted when
we created the manga database now the
get request at the moment returns all
the videos
so let's write code to get just a single
video that is identified by this
particular ID so let's go back to we
chose to be a code and over here I'm
going to make another get requests so
routers get in fact I can just copy
paste this copy paste and then we are
going to make a couple of changes so
this is going to be for videos set
videos followed by : ib now this is kind
of a placeholder this ID and this ID is
going to be passed in in the URL
now get requests for all videos is going
to change for change to get requests for
a single video and then instead of video
dot find we are going to say video dot
find by ID now this is going to take an
argument which is nothing web request
dot talams dot ID so when we make a
request from the browser this ID is
going to be passed over here so the
request object has a parameter called ID
so longus please find the video that has
this particular ID so that is how this
works and instead of fetching a list of
videos it is going to give us just a
single video and again if there is an
error we are going to log to the console
at a retrieving video else we are going
to respond dot JSON the video so now I
can save this and to test let's go back
to the browser and remember videos slash
ID so I'm going to copy this IP over
here and this should return just the
first video so over here I'm going to
paste it and again let me go back to get
back and then restart the server so
server is now running again I'm going to
make a request and there we go we just
have the single video the ID matches
that
you are a the description is angular
description URL and then of course we
have the title so that is how you fetch
a single video or multiple videos from
the database using Mongoose now to test
a get request postman is not required
but let's learn to use it anyway because
we need it in the upcoming videos now
postman is a Chrome extension or a
chrome application that makes testing of
API is very easy now in order to test
create update or delete API postman is
necessary it prevents the creation of
four or any front-end code to submit any
day down now in this lecture I will show
you how to make a gift request with
postman so in Google just type postman
Chrome Web Store and you should be
readout redirected to this go ahead
install it and launch the application
now once you launch the application you
can sign in with your Google account and
you should have an interface that looks
somewhat like this now the first thing
you want to do is set the request type
as this is going to be a get request now
over here in the URL I'm going to type
localhost 3,000 slash API slash videos
and then click on the send button now
this is going to provide a list of
videos inside the database so we have an
angular description and then a MongoDB
description and then note tutorial and
then this was of course some testing
data that was inputted all right so we
have the three videos that were
retrieved now similarly if I want to
retrieve a single video I'm going to
copy the ID and then over here followed
by a frontslash and then the ID so this
is going to return just the single video
so as you see it's very easy to test
with postman and it might not be as much
used for a get request because we can of
course do that in a browser but as you
see in the upcoming videos for post put
and delete this
is very useful all right so you should
now have an understanding of how to
fetch single and multiple videos from
the database in the next video let's see
how to insert a new video into the
database so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
