learned how to create a model driven
form but if you have a look at the model
we are calling this new form control
multiple times now if this might seem
okay at first but if the form contains
let's say twenty to thirty fields the
code kind of looks messy and for this
reason we have the form builder class
now the form builder class as the name
suggests is used to build forms and it
is just a syntactical improvement in
creating a model driven form so in this
video let's see how to use the form
builder class now let's start off by
removing this form control because we
don't need that anymore
instead we are going to be using the
form builder so import form builder now
let's comment this piece of code over
here but I'm going to leave it there so
you can compare the two approaches and
the first thing we are going to do is
let's create a property called user form
this one that is going to represent our
model so user form and this is going to
be of type form group
now remember every form is a phone group
next we need to create an instance of
this form builder class and the way we
are going to do that is using the es2015
syntax so we're going to be using the
constructor method the constructor and
then this is going to take private and
I'm going to explain in just a bit what
this does for builder of type form
builder alright so this is the es es
2015 shorthand syntax for creating an
instance of this form builder so this is
basically let's say a local variable
that we are going to be using to refer
to this instance of form builder so now
we are going to create the form but the
form we are going to implement it in the
ng on in it lifecycle hook now we are
going to talk about lifecycle hooks in
angular Nelly
part of the series but for now let's try
to understand just the energy on Annette
lifecycle hook now over here next to
component I'm also going to import on in
it
and I need to extend this export class
add component implement on init
implement implements on in it and now if
you have a look it says it doesn't
implement the ng on in it so over here
I'm going to have ng on in it and in
here we are going to create the model
for this form so we are going to start
off with this dot user form so this
right here the property so this dot user
form is equal to now we have an instance
of this form builder class and we are
going to be making use of that instance
so this dot underscore form builder and
the form builder class provides a method
called group so we are going to be using
that to create this form so we're going
to open this and if you have a look the
first form field is name so we're going
to specify name and then the array the
first one or the first part of this
array is the default value so let's go
with Brandon since we had the default
value as Brandon over here as well and
then the second parameter or the second
thing that we are going to specify is
this added a validation list so we are
going to have the required field
validator a min length and a max length
so I'm going to copy this and paste it
right over here alright the next thing
we need is the email form field so email
but we don't have any specifications so
it's just going to be empty and then
we're going to have address but if you
know it is again address is not a new
font
show it's a new form group so again we
are going to say this dot underscore
form builder dot group then this in turn
is going to take street there's going to
be empty as well and then we are going
to have a city this is going to be empty
as well and then we're going to have the
postal code and this is going to the
default value will be no but we have the
validation and the validation is a
validator pattern so I'm going to copy
this and let's paste it over here so now
we have the exact same thing that we did
in the previous video but now with the
form builder class and that's it so now
when we save this let's go back to our
form
it's reloading all right so let's check
let's see if all the validations still
work now I'm going to remove the
complete name and it says please enter a
name and I'm going to say three
characters it's going to say please
enter at least four characters and I'm
going to go with more than ten
characters and it says name cannot
exceed ten characters and the same with
postal code if I go with three numbers
it's going to say postal code format is
five digits so let's submit something
that is valid let's go back with Brandon
and the postal code is one two three
four five and let me also open the
console so that you can have a look at
the data that is getting submitted so
over here I'm going to click OK let's go
with an email Rob at email com Street
Baker and then the city London now when
I click on submit I get the object so I
still get the address object again which
in turn contains the city postal code
and Street and we also have name and
email all right so that's pretty much
how you create a form using this form
builder class it's the exact same model
driven form but with a better syntax so
thank you guys for watching and
in the next video let's see something
