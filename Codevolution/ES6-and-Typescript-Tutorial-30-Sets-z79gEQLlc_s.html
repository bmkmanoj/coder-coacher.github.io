number 30 and in this video we are going
to be learning about sets now as I
mentioned in the last video a set is a
data structure which contains a list of
values that are unique so to create a
new set we knew it so let my set is
equal to new said and we are going to
ignore the red underline for the time
week now once we have a new set we can
add elements to the set by calling the
add method on the set so my set dot add
and we can pass let's say hello now to
check the size of the set or how many
elements are present in the set we use
the size property so let's log to the
console my set dot size so when we save
this and refresh the browser it's going
to be 1 and the values we store in a set
are not restricted to string values so
we can have my stead dot add and Neumann
a number or a numeric value so when we
save this size is going to be 2 and
let's try to add the same value again to
the set so my said dot add 1 and when we
save this and refresh it the size still
remains 2 so a set can only contain
unique values so when you try to insert
or add a duplicate value it is going to
ignore that particular value now let me
ask you this
let's create two new objects let will be
one is equal to this and let o be 2 is
equal to also the same thing now when we
try to add my set add o be 1 and my set
dot add ob2 what do you think the size
of the set is going to be so let's save
this and refresh our browser it's going
to be for now because objects are not
converted to strings the two objects
will be unique and that is how the set
of my set is the size of our set is 4
now we can also initialize values using
an array during the creation of a set so
we can have let new set is equal to new
set and in the parentheses we can pass
an array so let's have a couple of
duplicate values as well so when I try
to log to the console the size of the
set so new set dot size and go to the
browser it's going to give us four so
the first four values were unique and
were saved into new set
but the last two values were duplicate
values and were ignored so that is how
the size of new set is for now you can
also change the add method to add
elements to a set so we can have let
chain set is equal to new set dot add
and let's add hello and let's also add
world so this right here is chaining of
the add method so when I log to the
console when I log to the console chain
set dot size we should have two so there
you go now to check for existence of a
value in a set we use the hash method so
we're here a new set let's see if the
value 1 is present or not so let's log
to the console new set dot has and what
is the value we want to check it is 1 so
when we save this and refresh our
browser it is true and when I change 1
to 5 let's save this and it becomes
false so to check for an existence of a
value in a set we use the hash method
and to delete a value from a set we use
the delete method so let's delete the
value 1 it saved us and after deleting
let's log to the console let's log to
the console you said dot size so
initially it was for now we are deleting
an element so
the new size should be three and there
you go initially for the deletion was
true and now it is three the size of the
set so that's pretty much it about a set
we have a set we create a set using new
and then we can add using add method we
can check for an existence using the
hash method and delete using the delete
method and the size of the set can be
found out using the size property so
that's pretty much it for this video in
the next video let us understand about
weak sets thank you guys for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
