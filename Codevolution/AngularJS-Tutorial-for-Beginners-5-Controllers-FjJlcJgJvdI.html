us learn about controllers now in a
previous video we have been using ng in
the directive to initialize our data and
then we have been using expressions to
display them onto your screen let us
quickly recollect with an example go
ahead and create a div tag within the
Dib tag use ng in it and initialize name
to be equal to Chandler Bing now within
the div tag we can make use offer
expression to display the name on to
your screen so go ahead and save it and
reload your browser and it says
Chandler Bing now using ng in the
directive is probably not the ideal way
to initialize our data which brings us
to controllers the controller helps us
to get data onto our view controller is
where we define values and functions
that make up the behavior of our angular
application so let us go ahead and
create our very first controller let's
go to address and type app dot
controller now we specify a name to the
controller let us say my controller and
we need to specify something called
dollar scope now dollar scope is a
JavaScript object and it is the glue
between our controller and our view so
that is how data is made available to
both the controller and our index dot
HTML the second thing we need to specify
is a function which takes dollar scope
as its argument now within a function or
the constructor function we can go ahead
and type dollar scope dot name as equal
to say Ross Geller so name is our
variable and by attaching
to the scope object we can be using it
in our index dot HTML page go ahead for
the semicolon save it let's go back to
our index dot HTML okay so we have
created our controller but how do we
tell our HTML when to know a controller
is there so you guessed it it's a
director replace the entry in a director
with ng-controller director
now the ng-controller direct - we have
to specify the name of the controller so
in our case it is my controller now
within the controller the scope since
the name variable is attached to the
scope we can go ahead and directly use
the name variable in our controller so
if we save it reload it then we have
Ross Geller
suppose we have another variable dollar
scope dot age is equal to let's say 28
go ahead and save it go back to our
index file and type H save it
reload it you have Ross Geller and his
28 what happens if you don't attach the
dollar scope to our variable so let us
say weight is equal to 150 and let's
specify weight as an expression so save
it save it reload it so the weight is
not displayed now that's the speciality
that's the speciality of the scope
object scope object is going to make the
variable value available to both the
controller and our view now what happens
if we have let's go ahead and remove
weight what happens if you use the scope
variable outside a controller so let us
remove weight let us remove our age
and outside the dip tag let's type H
save it go ahead and reload it now we
see that there's only Rosco learned that
it's printed out so what ng-controller
directive specifies is the scope of the
controller so we have a controller
called my controller and scope of the
controller is within this div tag so any
variable that is attached to the scope
object can be accessed within this div
tag but anywhere outside it can't be
accessed all right so that's pretty much
about controllers we created a
controller and we specified a name to
our controller we also specify the scope
object that the function uses and the
scope object is used to glue the data
between a controller and our index not
HTML the scope variable the scrip object
rather makes the data available in our
index dot HTML to be used as an
expression but the scoop object can be
is limited to the ng controller and
outside the ng-controller the scope is
not valid anyway thank you for watching
don't forget to subscribe and I'll I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
