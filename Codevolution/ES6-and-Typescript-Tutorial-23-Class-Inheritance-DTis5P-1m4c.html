number 23 and in this video we are going
to be learning about class inheritance
now in es2015
class inheritance is possible with the
extents keyword so the exits keyword is
used to create a new class that inherits
from a parent class let's have a look at
an example I'm going to create a class
called person and within the body we are
going to have as a constructor and
within the constructor you're just going
to log to the console person constructor
now let's create a new class called
class employee that inherits from this
person class so to do that we are going
to use the extents keyword followed by
the name of the parent class so person
in our case and for this example I'm
going to leave the body of this employee
class blank but we are going to create a
new instance of it so let T is a call to
new employee so now when we save this
and head over to the browser
it says person constructor so even
though the derived class has no
constructor of its own when we create a
new instance of employee the constructor
method of class person which is the
parent class is invoked and this holds
true even for parameter s constructors
so if you pass a name and then pass name
plus and then over here let's pass a
name so even though the employee class
does not have a parameter s constructor
it is going to invoke the constructor of
the parent class so Chandler is going to
replace this name over here and if we
head over to the browser we see Chandler
person constructor so to create a new
class we use class keyword followed by
name of the class and to inherit from
the class we use the extends keyword
followed by the
of the parent class and in es2015
if there is no constructor in the
derived class the constructor from the
parent class is going to get involved
now let's have a look at a scenario
where we have a constructor within the
derived class as well so here in class
employee we can create a constructor
this is going to accept a name and then
we're just going to log to the console
name plus employee constructor now if
you have a look at this we have a red
squiggly underline and if I hover over
it it says constructors for derived
classes must contain a super call so to
eliminate this error I'm going to
introduce a new keyword called super and
this is going to accept name as well now
why is this keyword necessary
well the parent class constructor needs
to be called before the subclass
constructor and this ensures that if you
call any method on the parent class in
the constructor the parent has already
successfully set up so the super keyword
right here is going to invoke the
constructor of the parent class and this
is going to insure everything from there
from there onwards is going to function
fine so super keyword to call the
constructor from the parent class so now
when we save this it says Chandler
person constructor which is a parent
constructor and then Chandler employee
constructor which is the derived class
constructor ok so next thing let's
create a new method get' ID and this is
just going to return 10 now over here
I'm going to log to the console
e dot get ID now if you have a look at
this over here in our derived class we
don't have a method called get ID from
ever because our parent class has a
method called get ID and we are
inheriting that class to class employee
we have access to this method using the
instance of employee class so e dot get
ID is going to call the get ID method of
the parent class so when we save this we
get the value 10 so now let's say we
have a get ID method over here in the
derived class so let's return 50 what it
index what what do you think the output
is going to be so let's go over here it
says 50 so when the derived class has
the method it is going to call the
method from the derived class if it is
not present it is going to call the
method from the parent class but now how
do we access this parent class method
now this is where the super keyword
comes into play again so instead of
returning 50 we can say return super dot
get ID so when we save this we get 10
which is the return value from the
parent get ID method so that's pretty
much it about class inheritance we
mainly focus on two key words the
extends keyword and the super keyword
the extends keyword is used to inherit
from the parent class which is specified
on the right-hand side and the super
keyword is used to invoke the
constructor of the parent class so that
the rest of the code functions properly
and the super keyword is also used to
get access to the methods that are this
that are defined in the parent class so
here you get ID is also present
the parent class and the derived class
and if you want to access this get ID
from the parent class we do a super dot
get ID so that brings us to the end of
classes from the next video we are going
to be focusing on modules so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
