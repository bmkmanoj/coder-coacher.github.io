fetch data using HTTP now whenever we
work with HTTP the first thing we need
to do is import the HTTP module in our
route module so we're here in AB dot
module latias under browser module I'm
going to import the HTTP module and this
we're going to import from angular slash
HTTP package and then I'm also going to
include it in the imports array so that
HTTP module is available within our
application now by importing the HTTP
module we are also registering the HTTP
service with angular's injector so there
is no need to explicitly register the
HTTP service like we did with employee
service HTTP module will do that for us
and now to use HTTP in our employee
service class we declare it as a
dependency in the constructor so we're
here an employee service I'm going to
add a constructor and this constructor
we're going to inject the dependency so
private underscore HTTP and this is of
type HTTP and then I also need to import
HTTP to get rid of that squiggly so HTTP
and we check this from angular slash
core sorry any team from angular slash
HTTP so now we have a local variable
HTTP that we can use to refer to an
instance of HTTP all right so now we are
ready to fetch data using HTTP so let's
have a look at the steps we had listed
down in the previous video now the first
step is to make the HTTP GET call from
employee service so we don't need this
hard-coded data anymore instead we are
going to use the get method on HTTP so
this dot underscore HTTP so this refers
to an instance of HTTP we are going to
invoke the get method
and this guest method takes in a URL as
its argument now we all are still
beginners learning the concepts of
angular so let's not take the trouble of
creating a web server and then
configuring it just to serve up four
lines of data so for our application we
will fetch the data from a file that
let's say we assume to be on a server so
I have created a folder called API data
and within the folder I have a file
named employee data dot JSON now this
contains the required data for our
application so we are going to be
serving the data from this file instead
of the server so we're back over here an
employee service I'm going to create a
new variable so private underscore URL
this is going to be of type string and
this contains the URL where the get
request is made so API data is the name
of the folder and the file name is
employee data dot JSON so we're here I'm
going to pass this dot underscore URL so
now we are making a get request to this
particular URL and in the future if you
do have a working server just replace
this URL to point to that server
everything is going to work as it is so
that is our first step and for our
second step we need to receive the
observable and then map it to JSON so
back here every observable is going to
have some operators that we can use so
once this get but that returns an
observable I'm going to call dot map so
map is an operator and this takes in an
arrow function as its argument and I'm
going to explain in just a bit
what this does so response and then it
is going to give us response dot JSON
and then I need to import response from
HTTP
and also I need to import the map
operator
so from rxjs ad operator map so
basically what we are doing is I have
received the observable and I need to
convert it into JSON format so what is
the observable that we receive it is
nothing but the response object so I'm
creating a local variable or I'm
referring to this response using a
smaller or lowercase response and I'm
just converting that into JSON format so
the left-hand side is kind of the input
response and the right-hand side is the
output response JSON so we have a JSON
formatted file now so now let's save
this and for our third step we need to
subscribe to the observable so forth and
our fourth step is to assign the data to
a local variable in the view so let's do
both these steps together back here an
employee list component now this dot
employee is our local variable but we
cannot directly assign the get employees
method the get employees method is going
to all right let me just clear it and
then we can write we can start over so
this dot underscore employee service so
this is the instance of employee service
we have you can call get employees
method now we need to subscribe to this
employee the observable otherwise we are
not going to receive the data in our
component now the SUBSCRIBE method is
going to take in an error function as
its argument again and this is going to
be our es which stands for response
employee data and this we are going to
say this dot employees which is the
array we have is equal to response
employee data so let me explain what is
happening here so we have an instance of
employee service and with that we are
going to call
get employees method now this get
employs method if you have a look is
going to return and observable now
observables don't send data unless you
subscribe to them so our employee
service will not send data to employee
list component unless we subscribe to
them so on this observable I'm going to
call the SUBSCRIBE method now if the
subscriber that takes in an arrow
function as its argument now as the
input it is going to take response
employee data and then on the output
side or on the right-hand side we are
going to assign that to the employees
array that we have over here and this
employee's array is what we have in our
view we iterate through the different
employees and print just the name so the
first argument to subscribe method is
the data that we receive so now we can
do the same thing in our employee
details component so I'm going to copy
this let's go over here and replace it
so now I'm going to save this I'm going
to save everything let's go back to here
and save this and let's see if our
application works and there you go now I
did add an extra employee just to make
sure that we are in fact serving the
data from the file and there you go we
just had four employees before now we
have a fifth employee Felicia that is
also being displayed so just just to
summarize so that observables is
imprinted on your mind here's what we
did the first step in AB dot module dot
es we include HTTP module is TP module
and then an employee service TS we
inject HTP as a dependency so we can now
have an instance of HTTP and we refer to
that using underscore HTTP and then we
invoke the get method passing the URL
where the request has to be made and
this URL is nothing but the file over
here employee data dot JSON now when we
make an HTTP call we get an observable
but that is not the desired format we
need the JSON format
so we can use the map operator on
unobservable to convert the response
into its JSON format now from our
service we are returning an observable
in the JSON format
but then the observable doesn't send out
data unless someone subscribes to it
so in our employee list component we
make sure that we subscribe to this
observable returned by the get employees
method now when we subscribe to an
observable as its first argument we get
the data that is returned as a response
so this response employee data is
nothing but the observable values in the
JSON format and with that value we are
going to assign it to our local variable
employees this employees is used in the
view to list out the employee names and
the same thing with employee details so
there you go that's how we fetch data
using HTTP so right thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
