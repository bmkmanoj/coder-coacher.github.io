to mention in the last video is that you
have to click on this publish button to
actually publish your extension to the
webstore so once you have your draft
ready click on this publish button
alright so for the last part of the
series I thought that I would give you
all some insight into some of the sample
extensions that Google provides for us
to have a look at so good
developer.chrome.com/apps slash samples
and over here we can download and have a
look at the code of some of the
extensions and for beginners I would
recommend you go through page Reder this
is a very simple extension that just
changes the background color of the body
tag to read again very simple and very
useful for a beginner and the other
thing is the icon changer so this is a
browser action which changes its icon
when clicked so basically you have a
browser action icon and every time you
click on this the icon changes so pretty
good one and finally some of the API is
that you can have a look at to start
with your own extension let's say you
can use the alarms API maybe to send a
notification every half an hour or one
hour to maybe stretch your legs or drink
water and we already had a look at
context menus let's see what else
declarative content so this is something
similar to the page action where you can
specify when a particular page action
like page action icon should be
highlighted so again this page action by
URL is a very good one and other things
let's see you can have a look at the
omnibox so this right here is called the
omnibox and any functionality you want
to have with that you can use this
omnibox api and then you can also have
extensions that work on the dev tools so
dev tools dot panels for example scratch
j/s and if you did visit my es6
tutorials you would find that scratch is
actually it's an extension that words in
the dev tools and let's see what else
finally we can have a look at this
tedious and tedious engine
related to text-to-speech where you can
not only specify what has to be spoken
but in what language and in what voice
so there are a couple of voices that you
can use to make chrome speak the
selected text well I hope you guys
enjoyed the series and learned a lot
about Chrome extensions and if you do
create your own extension do leave a
comment I would love to hear from that
and yeah make sure you subscribe to the
channel and until next time take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
