look at the rest operator in es 2015 now
consider this example let's say we need
a function that is going to display a
list of colors so let's have a function
display colors and this is going to take
variable number of arguments so if you
pass red it needs to display red let's
copy-paste so red and if you pass red
and blue it needs to display red and
blue and red blue green it needs to
display red blue and green so what we
would do in es5 or JavaScript we would
have let display colors and this is
going to be equal to a function and we
would say for let I in arguments log
arguments of I now let's have a look at
the output save this so we have red from
our first function call over here red
and then red blue so red blue and then
we have red blue and green from our
third function call now with this code
there are a few problems and the first
thing is suppose someone is new to
JavaScript they would not quite
understand right away okay we have a
function that takes no parameters
yet we are passing certain variable
number of arguments how does that work
and also we are making use of the
arguments object now where did that come
from
right and consider this scenario let's
say we want to display a message before
we display the list of colors so let
message plus equal to let's say list of
colors and over here let's pass message
let me just copy paste this control C
control V control V and over here
before we display our list of colors I
want to log message so that we have
first list of colors and then we have
the actual list of colors so let me save
this and see what our output this hmm we
have a list of colors but then we have a
duplicate list of colors now this is
because this message is also part of
this arguments object so the first time
message is going to be logged and then
in this for loop we get this message and
then red we get the message and then red
blue we get the message and then red
blue green so our message and then
message plus red so our message message
plus red blue our message and message
red blue green you get the idea so this
kind of breaks our code whenever we use
the arguments object to iterate through
our parameters or arguments now that's
not a good thing
so in es2015 this is where our new rest
parameter syntax comes into play so the
rest parameter represents an indefinite
number of arguments as an array so let's
have a look at let's have a look at an
example now over here what we do is in
our function call we say message and
then we can have three dots which is the
syntax for the rest parameter followed
by any name of your choice so dot dot
since we are using a variable list of
colors I'm going to be using colors now
I'm going to change arguments to colors
and then console dot log colors of I so
now let me save this and refresh we
still have a list of colors but this
time we just displayed only once per
function call so over here this is one
function call when we do it with when we
call display colors with
red and then lists of colors with red
blue and then the circulars with red
blue green so how this works is this
colors is actually going to convert this
list of arguments into an array and then
we are going to iterate through that
array in this for loop so to show to you
in fact that colors is actually an array
I'm going to log console dot log colors
let me save this and there you go
red it's Mary red and blue is Mary red
blue green is an array so by doing this
we can add any number of parameters
without affecting this part of our code
I can have a second parameter that is
thank you and I can console that log
thank you but this for loop remains
unaffected we are not going to be
printing duplicate values now if you
want to quickly have a look at the
arguments so arguments dot length we
save this refresh it so we have two
three and four so this colors or this
array is going to represent a single
argument so that's why it's going to
message plus red which is two arguments
message red blue three and message red
blue green four so I would say that
pretty much covers the rest parameter
syntax the rest parameter is used to
represent variable number of parameters
or arguments that we can pass and use in
our functions this comes like this comes
quite handy so in our next video let's
have a look at the spread operator in
es2015 so thank you guys for watching
