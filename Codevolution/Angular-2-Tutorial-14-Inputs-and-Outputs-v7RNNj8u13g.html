bindings from component to the template
view or from the view to the component
property so the data flow was happening
within the component but sometimes a
scenario would arise where we need to
pass the data from the parent component
to the child component or vice-versa so
there is nothing but from our app
component to the tutorial component or
from the tutorial component to our app
component so for that we make use of
inputs and outputs and that is what we
are going to be learning in this video
so to get started I already have some
HTML code typed out so let me explain to
you what we are doing so our basic
intention is we have our parent app
component so these three lines over here
and if I enter a value in my parent
component so parent data I want this
value to be displayed over here in our
child component so we're here and if I
type in something over here in our child
component I want this to be displayed
over here in our parent component so
what we have is a header tag with parent
or app component a label over here in
the text box and another paragraph that
says value from the child component is
now similarly for our child component we
have a header tag excuse me a label and
input and finally the value from the
parent app component is so if you go
back to your code we have the header tag
over here a label that says enter the
value an input and finally a paragraph
to display the value from child tutorial
component s and similarly in our
tutorials component we have a header tag
that says this is the child component
label that says into the value input box
to accept the value and finally a
paragraph that says value from the
parent component is so let us first see
how to pass data from the parent to the
child so from our app
opponent to our tutorials component so
for that we are first going to create a
new property so public let's say parent
data and this is a string value now
whenever we accept a property as an
input from another component then we
need to use the inputs configuration and
within the inputs configuration we need
to specify the property so in our case
parent data so we are saying that we
have a property called parent data that
is an input to this component so right
now this component is ready to accept an
input so let's go to our parent
component which is the app component and
send that input so over here in our
input text box I'm going to create a
reference hash that says ptex or parent
text and I'm also going to create a
dummy event so key up is equal to 0 so
what this does is it is just a dummy
event that is going to trigger a UI
update so that the view is refreshed
every time you press a key or release a
key and now back here in our my
tutorials tag or component we are going
to have property binding so parent data
is the property from the child component
and this is going to be equal to P text
dot value so we have our P text or the
parent text entered here we are going to
access its value and then is properly
binding to assign it to our parent data
so if we go to our tutorials component
then we can use interpolation over here
that says parent data now when I save
this and our page is refreshed I'm going
to enter something and the parent come
so parent value or parent data and you
see here that the parent data is
automatically displayed so whatever you
enter so if that's working fine so that
is how you pass data from a parent
component to its child component you
declare a property you say that it is an
input you use interpolation to display
that input we're back in our parent
component we use a text the input field
to receive the text using a reference
retrieve its value and use property
binding to assign it to our parent data
now in the same way we need to pass
tutorials component value or data
something a data that is entered in our
child component to our app component but
this is a bit different because over
here we have the child component over
here and we could use data binding or
probably data mining but in a tutorials
component we do not have the app
component written or typed out anywhere
so when we are passing value in general
anything from our child component to our
parent component we need to emit an
event and from the child component and
our parent component is going to catch
that event and retrieve the values from
that event so for this we are going to
be using outputs configuration so here
we are going to let's say we are going
to name this as child event so this
child event is an event that is an
output from this child component so over
here in our class we are going to
declare child event
let's okay let's um I'm going to say
child event is equal to new event
emitter
and this is going to be off string and
if you see here I have a red underline
so we need to import that you end
emitter class so event
emitter from angular core so from
angular slash core okay so we have
created a child event which is an
instance of this emitter event emitter
class now we are going to create a
reference to our input similar to the
app component so we're here I'm going to
say hash let's call this child text and
again on key up
so whenever the key is released now
instead of having a dummy event we're
actually going to have an event handler
so on change I'm going to have this
child event or the child text value
given so we are going to say child text
dot value so whenever a key up event is
triggered the value in the input text
box is being sent to this event handler
now over here we need to define our
event handler so on change that we are
going to retrieve a value it is of type
string and here we are going to say this
dot child event got emit this value so
basically we are saying that we are
asking the child to emit this event with
value so our value is nothing but this
child text dot value which is the value
entered in the input box now back here
in our app component over here what we
can do is include event binding so
child event is the name of our event and
here when we catch that event to child
data we are going to assign dollar event
and over here
we are going to create public child data
of strength okay so let me explain to
you what is happening over here in our
tutorial component we create a new event
event instance which is child event and
we say that it is an output so whenever
a value is entered in our input box we
are going to trigger this on change
event handler and this is going to emit
this event with this particular value
and back over here we are going to use
event binding to assign to our child a
de property the dollar event and the dot
the dollar event is going to be nothing
but the value entered over here so when
we save this and let me also use
interpolation to display so child later
so let me save this
let me save tutorials component when we
reload it let's enter something in the
parent value so parent data still
working let's enter child data and there
you go
or here what we have entered in our
child component is displayed in the
parent component so that's pretty much
it about inputs and outputs hope you
guys and hope you guys understood and
enjoy the video so thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
