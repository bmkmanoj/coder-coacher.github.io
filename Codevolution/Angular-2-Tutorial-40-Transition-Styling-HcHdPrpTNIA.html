our very first angular animation so we
had two states on and off and we had
defined the styles for each of those
states now in angular it's also possible
to apply styles during the transition
between two different states so let's
try to understand how to do it with an
example now we are going to use the same
animation we created in the last video
we have lights on off we have the two
states off and on and in the off state
background color is black and the on
state background color is white and we
are going to transition from off to on
or from on to off for a duration of two
seconds so now to add styling for the
transition over here in the animate
function you can put a comma and then
specify style parentheses curly braces
over here any style that you want to
apply so for example I'm going to just
rotate the black color box by 90 degrees
so transform and rotate by 90 degrees so
when I save this and head over to the
browser I'm going to wait for this to
reload all right so now when I click on
toggle lights you're going to see this
black box rotating by 90 degrees for the
duration of two seconds
and then it is going to change the color
to white at the end of two seconds so
I'm going to click here it's going to
rotate 90 degrees rotation done and then
white color appears so you might think
that this is a pretty good animation but
what you have to keep in mind is that
this style gets applied only during the
two seconds of transition at the end of
two seconds it is going to return back
to its original position because state
on the only style we have applied is
background color white we haven't
applied transformation to the on state
so let me show you what I mean over here
in the div tag I'm going to add a text
rotate so let's go back to our browser
and wait for it to reload
and when it reloads you're going to see
this rotate text at the top when I click
on target lights it's going to rotate
rotate is going to come to the side but
at the end of two seconds it is going to
go back to its original position so this
style gets applied only during the
transition so that is very important to
keep in mind now another concept or
another let's say key point that I have
to mention here is that if you want to
apply or when you're applying these
animation durations and different styles
for a transition and if multiple
transitions have the same duration and
style you can merge them into a single
line for example let's say I wanted to
add the same thing to on to off
transition as well so I can simply do a
comma and then on to off so now I can
completely eliminate this line and when
I save this it is going to work as
expected off to on it's going to take
two seconds and rotate by 90 degrees on
to off it's going to take two seconds
and rotate by 90 degrees and when you
encounter this situation when you're
just toggling between two states you can
further reduce it to by directional
arrow off to on and then you can
eliminate this as well so two lines of
code into a single line off to on or on
to off you're going to apply two second
animation transition with rotation of 90
degrees so rotate there you go
rotate there you go so that is how
applying or that is how you apply styles
to a transition alright thank you guys
for watching and I'll see you guys in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
