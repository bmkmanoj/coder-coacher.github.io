application I'm going to use angular CLI
to create a basic angular project now I
have created a folder called me and
within the folder I'm going to open
command prompt so hold down the shift
key right click open command window here
now we can run the command ng new now
this is going to be followed by the name
of the project so I'm going to call this
ng app so this is the angular project
followed by an option - - routing now
this is an angular CLI command that
creates a new angular project with the
routing module now I'm going to press
Enter
now this cannon takes a few minutes but
what it does is it creates a folder
called ng app that contains our angular
application now once the command
successfully complete I can navigate
inside the project folder so CD ng app
and then I can run another angular CLI
command which is ng serve with the
option - hope to open the application in
the browser so when it loads in the
browser it should say application works
and there we go now to connect this
angular application with the Express
server angular CLI provides another
command which is the engi build command
so let's go back to our project folder
and over here in fact I can just cancel
this and then I can run the command ng
followed by build as you see the ng
build command execute very similar to
the Indy serve command the only
difference is that ng build command is
going to create a distributable folder
of the entire angular application now
the distributable folder is going to be
fed into the expert server so now that
we have our angular application created
and the distributable folder created in
the next video let's see how to connect
our angular application to the expert
server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
