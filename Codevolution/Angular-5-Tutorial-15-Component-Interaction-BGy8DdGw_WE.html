about component interaction now all this
while we've been working with the test
component and the test component is
nested inside the app component so the
app component is the parent component
and the test component is the child
component and so far they've been
working independently but in angular
applications you are going to come
across a scenario where the components
need to interact or communicate with
each other the parent component might
send some data to the child component
and the child component might also send
some data to the parent component so how
do the components interact
the answer is using input and output
decorators using the input decorator the
child can accept input from the parent
and using the output decorator the child
will send out events to the parent to
indicate something now for our example
here is what we will do we will send a
name from the app component to the test
component and in the test component we
are going to display hello followed by
the name for example
hello vishwas similarly we are going to
send a message hey code evolution from
the test component to the app component
and display that message in the app
component template and first let's take
a look at sending data from the parent
to the child in other words from the app
component to the test component so let
me go back to visual studio code and I
have opened app component dot tears so
in the app component class I'm going to
create a new property this is going to
be public name and set it to the string
which was now to send this property to
the test component we included in the
opening tag of the selector so in app
component dot HTML in the test component
selector
in the opening tag I'm gonna bind the
name property so we have a property
binding to a property called parent data
and we are binding the name that we have
declared in the app component class so
we are now sending this data to the test
component let's head over there and
receive it so in the test component I'm
going to declare the same property that
the add component is sending public
parent data but we need a way to inform
to the test component hey this is not a
normal property this is an input
property and you will receive this value
from the parent and the way we do that
is using the input decorator so right
before declaring the property we add the
input decorator at input and then
parentheses now we also need to import
it from angular slash core alright now
that we have the property value as an
input we can bind this to the template
so in the template I'm going to add an
h2 tag and use interpolation to display
hello followed by the parent data so now
if I save this and take a look at the
browser you can see hello which was so
we are sending the data from the parent
component to the child component and
displaying it in the child component now
sometimes you might want to use a
different property name than the one
parent component uses and for that we
can specify an alias with the input
decorator so instead of having parent
data over here I can have it within
parentheses within single quotes and
then I can name the property as name so
we are saying hey the input is still
parent data but within this component
I'm going to refer to it as name and
then we bind this to the template as
well so instead of parent data I'm going
to bind the name so now if we save this
and take a look at the browser
it still is hello vishwas works
perfectly fine so we have successfully
sent data from the parent component to
the child component now let's take a
look at sending data the other way round
from the child component to the parent
component now this is slightly different
in a parent component HTML we have the
child component selector so you can
easily bind the data this way but in a
child component you do not have the
parent component selector so you cannot
send data the same way the way a child
component sends data to the parent
component is using events so let's try
to send a message
hello code evolution from the test
component to the app component and
displayed in the app component so first
let's create an event that we can send
to the parent so in the test component
class create a new instance of the event
emitter class so public I'm going to
call this child event and this is going
to be equal to new event emitter and
make sure to import the event emitter
class so after input event emitter now
to be able to send this child event to
the parent we use the output decorator
so right before declaring public child
event we use add output and then
parentheses and make sure to import it
as well so input comma output comma
event emitter all right now we have set
up our custom event let's fire this
event on a button click so I'm gonna add
a new button over here that says send
event and on click let's call a fire
event method let's go ahead and define
this fire event method so fire event
within the body this dot child event dot
M it and then it
hey code evolution so this is the
message that we want to send to the
parent component alright now that the
event is emitted on the button click
let's capture it in the parent component
so let's go back to app component dot
HTML now just like how we bind to a
click event we can bind to our custom
event as well so within the app test
selector we can capture the child event
and once this event is captured let's
assign to a property called
message the dollar event variable now
this dollar event variable is going to
refer to hey code evolution which is the
string message that we want to send to
the parent component so now that we have
a property called message let's also
declare it in our app component class
and then display it in the template so
instead of welcome to title I'm going to
say message so let's test this out now
if I go back to the browser and I click
on this button you can see the message
hey code evolution displayed from the
app component so the data is flowing
from the child to the parent all right
let me quickly summarize so that you get
a better understanding now to send data
from the parent to the child in the
parent component declare a property and
then bind it to the child selector
parent data is equal to name in the
child component declare another property
with the input decorator you can use
either the same name or an alias you can
then bind that property in the child
component template now to send data from
the child to the parent we make use of
events we create an instance of the
event emitter class and then emit it
from the child component and we do that
using the output decorator the parent
component then
to the event that executes either a
template statement or can also call a
method the dollar event variable will
give access to the argument that was
sent from the child method hey code
evolution so you can assign this to a
property in your parent component which
is the app component you can then
display in the parent component template
in the h1 tag and that is how you see
hey code evolution all right so that is
about component interaction in angular
