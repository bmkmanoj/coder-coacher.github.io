concepts from hereon require additional
configuration when we are working with
typescript now the setup already
complicated that it is I don't want to
go in that crowd
so instead whenever necessary we are
going to be making use of scratch chairs
instead now I do apologize if switching
back and forth between scratches and
typescript is not your liking but my
intention is to focus on the concepts
and keep the explanation as simple as
possible for a beginner so for this
video
we are going to be making use of scratch
yes now in the last video we learned how
to create a new map and by using the set
method how to add key value pairs to the
map now there is another way to add key
value pairs to a map and that is by
using arrays doing map initialization so
we can have let my map is equal to new
map but this time within parentheses we
can specify an array so this array is
going to contain more arrays in turn so
let's have two key value pairs first
name this is going to be chandler and
let's also have last name which is going
to be Bing now that we have an array
sorry now that we have a new map
let's see or let's focus on how to
iterate over this map now if we need to
iterate only the keys of the map then we
make use of map keys method in a forest
statement so for let key of my map dot
keys we can have console dot log key so
when I run this and head over to the
console we get first name and last name
so just the keys and similarly if we
need only the values then we make use of
my map dot values so let value of my map
dog values we can blog
value so I'm just going to clear the
console and then run this there we go
Chandler and Bing which is the value for
first name and last name now if you need
both the key and value then we make use
of my map dot and trees so for we can
have let and tree off my map dot entries
and in console dot log let's make use of
backticks okay sorry with this pack tix
and we can have dollar curly braces we
can have entry of zero and we can just
have an arrow mark and then dollar entry
of one so now let me clear console and
run this there you go first name
Chandler and last name Bing now we can
also make use of destructuring for the
same cause so we can have instead of
entry key comma value and off map dot
entries and console.log or here this is
going to be key and this is going to be
value so when I run this okay let me
clear the log and then run this and
there you go first name Chandler last
name ping so that has helped you a trade
through just the keys just the values
and both keys and values in a map so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
