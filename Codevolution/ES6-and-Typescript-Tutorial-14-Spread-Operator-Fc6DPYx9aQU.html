be learning about the spread operator in
es2015 now spread is kind of the
opposite of rest operator
so while rest operator takes variable
number of parameters or arguments and
puts them into a single array the spread
operator takes an array and splits it
into the individual elements so rest is
to combine whereas spread is to split
now in our example over here the display
colors function takes individual colors
as the arguments now let's say from a
service or just from a database we are
getting an array of colors and not these
individual colors so we're going to have
an area of colors so let color array is
equal to let's go with some new colors
orange yellow and let's go with indigo
indigo now there's a problem this is not
going to work with our function right
here why because this expects individual
elements of the array now this is where
the spread operator is useful the split
operator takes an array and splits them
into the individual elements so we can
call it as display colors now we need
the message but now we has three dots
and this color array now let me just
comment this we don't need this anymore
you save this and the browser is
reloaded you have list of colors now
orange yellow indigo is from this so let
me save this okay
so let's have colors orange yellow and
indigo
now the spread operator might look
exactly same like the rest operator but
the difference is that rest operator is
specified in the function declaration
whereas the spread operator is specified
during function call so three dots
remains the same but this happens during
function call so over here we have taken
the color array which is an area and
using the spread operator it gets split
into the individual elements and those
individual elements are again combined
into a single array and then our for
loop is going to work it's magic so
that's how we have lists of colors
followed by orange yellow and indigo so
that's pretty much it the total short
topic
rest and spread they're pretty useful
when working with for loops or working
with functions when you have to deal
with variable number of parameters so
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
