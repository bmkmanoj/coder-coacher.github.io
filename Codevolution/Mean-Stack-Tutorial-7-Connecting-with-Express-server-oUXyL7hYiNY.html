the next step is to create the expert
server first we are going to install the
dependencies so in the current folder
that is the ng app folder open command
prompt and run the command npm install -
- save extras and 40 parser
now Express is the silver and body
parcel is the middleware to handle form
data once the dependencies are installed
open the project folder in your editor
so in Visual Studio code I have the ng
app folder opened now for the Express
server create a new file server Dodgers
in the root of the angular application
so basically in the same folder or in
the same place where this distributable
folder exists so click on you and it is
going to be server dot GS first I'm
going to include the packages that are
required so first we are going to
include Express
then we are also going to include the
body parser that we just installed and
also the built-in app module that is of
course a better alternative than string
concatenation when joining pads next I'm
going to declare the routes for the
application so cost api is equal to
required in the current folder we are
going to create a folder called server
and within the server folder a folder
called routes and within routes we are
going to create a new file called api
dodgers i will explain how this gets
used in just a bit next specify a port
for the server so const port is equal to
3000 now i'm going to create an instance
of extras so it cost AB is equal to
Express next I'm going to specify the
folder where all the angular code is
placed so we're going to use F dot use
followed by Express dot static and we
are going to join the path of the
current directory with the dist folder
so this basically gives Express the
access to the distributable folder I'm
also going to specify some code for the
body parser Middleburg so AB dot use
body parser dot URL encoded and extended
set to true so this basically passes the
text as URL encoded data similarly I'm
also going to specify AB dot use body
parser dot JSON so this parses the text
as JSON and it kind of allows for a JSON
like experience to work with all right
at the top I have declared the route for
the application which is the API route
so let me teach Express when to use it
so app dot use slash API and we are
going to specify the API load for any
other route than slash API the server
has to render the index dot HTML page in
the distributable folder so AB get for
any matching path so the wild-card start
character we are going to send the file
index dot HTML in the distributable
folder
so now if you browse localhost colon
3000 express knows it has to serve index
dot HTML
similarly for localhost colon 3000 slash
API
Express will use the API route and
execute AP ideas in the routes folder
the last step in silverchair
is to listen to request on port 3000 so
AB dot isn't on the port and then if it
was successful we are going to say so
we're running on localhost port 3000 in
the console before I can run server says
the routes folder has to be created with
API dot JS file within it so create a
server folder in the project folder you
must save server jet and over here in
the ng app folder we are going to create
a new folder called server within the
server folder we are going to create a
new folder routes within the rods folder
we are going to create a new file API
dot J in API dot Jess first I'm going to
require Express and then I'm going to
get ahold of Express router then for any
incoming requests we are going to send
back a string which is API works and
then of course we need to export the
router now we are in a position to test
our expert server now in the project
folder in the same folder that contains
server Dodge's open command prompt and
type node server so our server should
now be running on localhost port 3000 go
back to Chrome and in the URL type
localhost colon 3000 you should be able
to see the string at work now similarly
if I type localhost 3000 slash API you
should be able to see the string API
works let me explain the flow of
execution so that you get a better
understanding of the code written so far
so go back to server gels and over here
when you make a request to localhost
3000 this part of the code gets executed
so the index dot HTML file is going to
be returned in the browser when you make
a request to localhost colon 3000 slash
API this particular line of code gets
executed so Express knows that API route
has to be executed that searches for API
route which is nothing but execute API
dodges in the load folder in server GS
so it's going to go inside the server
folder inside the rod folder and then
inside API dodges and when it receives a
request it just sends back the string
API works so now our Express server is
up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
