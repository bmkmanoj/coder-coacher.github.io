might feel that there's not a whole lot
of space between the text and the border
surrounding it so if you ever want to
add some space between the content and
the water then we make use of an
attribute called cell padding so going
back to your code next to border you can
specify cell padding and this is going
to be equal to the amount of pixels you
want to pad between the content and the
border so let's say five so when you
save it and observe how the content is
now and when I reload it you see that
there is a bit more spacing between the
content and the border let me just
change it to ten so that you can have a
better look again so 10 save it now
reload it and there you go more space
and the more the amount the more the
pixels the more the padding and if you
ever want to include some space between
each of the cells then we make use of an
attribute called cell spacing so we have
another attribute called cell spacing
and once again we can specify let's say
3 we don't want a whole lot of gap it
looks ugly so okay it did not make much
difference let me go to 10 save it
and when I reloaded you see that there
is a whole lot of gap between one cell
and the other so that's how you provide
space between the content and the border
and from one cell to the other just
quickly going to make this as 2 because
I don't like how it is anyway - ok
alright so next is the width of the
table so if you if you'll notice the
width of the table was always going to
be wrapped around the text which
of the maximum blend if you want to
specify your own wet though then we can
make use of the width at root but what
attribute so next your cell spacing we
can have where it is equal to let's say
500 pixels when you save it and reload
it so you have it over 500 pixels and
you can also specify it as a percentage
let's say 50% and when you reload it
it's going to take 50 percent of the
total page size available so there's a
total of 100 but I want this table to
take up 50% of it and that's how it
works and finally I should have
mentioned this in the very beginning but
anyway to add a caption to your table we
can mean we can make use of the caption
tag so caption and we can specify let's
say cast of friends and save it and
reload it and over here
you see that on the very top at the very
center we have the caption that says
cast of friends so anyway thank you guys
for watching don't forget to subscribe
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
