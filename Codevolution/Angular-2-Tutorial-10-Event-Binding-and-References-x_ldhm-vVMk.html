of the angular 2 series I mean the
previous videos we learned about data
binding where the data where the data
flows from the component to our view so
when the component class properly
changes the view was updated now we were
only setting the values to the Dom
element properties but there was no way
to get or retrieve the Dom element
properties now for example there might
be a situation where the user would fill
up a form or click a button which
results in the flow of data from the
view to our component class and this is
where even binding comes into picture by
helping us capture the data flow from
the view to the component so in order to
understand even binding better let's
first create a button so button that
says click me ok so just like how we had
square brackets for property binding for
event binding we use parentheses and
what goes inside parentheses in the
event so let's say click event of the
button so every event will be assigned
an event handler so whenever and click
event is raised
let us call a method called on click and
in our class over here let's define that
method so on click and to keep it simple
let's just console dot log button click
alright and when we save this and go to
our browser which would be reloaded we
have our click Me button so let's go
ahead and open our console now when I
click it says button clicked
there's a typo so again I click it it
says button clicked twice so you get the
idea now in a angular it is very easy to
reference HTML elements or HTML tags now
to reference an element all we need to
do is use the hash symbol with any
random variable so let's say we have an
input so input type is equal to text and
to reference this we can use the hash
symbol followed by any variable you wish
to use so let's call this demo input all
right and now in order to get the data
that is flowing from this input we can
use this reference variable so for
example let's say we pass demo input
sorry demo input dot value as one of the
parameters to our on click method and
then we use that value over here use the
value over here and then console dot log
the value so when we save this and and
our browser is refreshed let me enter a
value so hello world and let me click on
the button so it is going to log the
value within this input field which we
are referencing using this reference
variable or demo input so that is how
event binding happens so we have bound
the button click event with a handler
called on click and here we are going to
be using a reference to this input
element
so demo input is the reference and
bypassing its value we can retrieve the
value here in our class now just to show
you
demo input actually refers to this input
field let's just pass demo input instead
of demo input value so demo input is
passed over to on click method and when
the when I click it says input type is
equal to text so this entire HTML
element is the reference variable demo
input now any valid event can be
specified within this parentheses for
example let's say mouse over so mouse
over and when we save it and the browser
is reloaded observe I'm just moving my
mouse over the button
I'm not even clicking it so if I move my
mouse over it it is going to console dot
log the reference variable which is
nothing but the input element finally to
capture event we use the dollar event so
let's say dollar event is the parameter
we are passing now when we refresh it
over here when I move my mouse over
click me it is going to give me the
event that cost and it is going to give
me the event that was raised so mouse
event and it is possible to access any
of the properties of this particular
event so to sum up event binding is
going to be data flowing from the view
to our class properties so here we have
just used a button and to have an event
we use the parentheses and we assign it
an event handler now we can pass we can
use reference variables to access the
properties of a particular HTML element
and
pass that on to our on event handler
which we can then use it in our class to
manipulate or we can also pass the
dollar event which is going to give us
information about the particular event
so that's pretty much it about event
binding thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
