important that we understand how
versioning works with packages and this
is where semantic versioning comes into
picture
now semantic versioning is a
specification where a version is
represented by three numbers that mean
the same thing for every developer so
let's try to understand with an example
I'm going to run the command npm install
lo - - - save so that the package gets
installed locally and is also entered in
the package JSON file now when this
happens lo - is entered with the latest
version so when we use NPM install a
package by default gets installed with
the latest stable release and these
three numbers here the first one four
represents the major version number
sixteen represent represents the minor
version number and one represents the
patch version number now anytime there
is a bug fix or a performance
improvement let's say this patch version
number gets implemented so one becomes
two and minor version number gets
incremented when there is a new feature
but that feature is not going to break
any existing functionality so one six
might become one seven or it might even
become two zero and so on and finally we
have the major version number now this
gets incremented only when there is
breaking when there's a break in the
existing functionality for example
angular 1 to angular 2 so there are many
changes that broke the existing
functionality so the major version
number gets updated but sometimes we
might need a specific version of a
package rather than the latest version
of the package so to install a specific
package version we use the add symbol
followed by the package version so let's
try to install NPM install lo - but this
time
going to install a previous version
let's go with three point three point
zero and then - - saved so that we save
it in the package.json file so when I
run this it's going to install low - at
the specified version so three point
three point oh and if you have a look at
the package.json file it gets updated to
the version that we installed it now
sometimes we might also want to restrict
to the minor version number for example
let's go with all right I need major
version of four and I need a minor
version of let's go with one for but the
patch version
I need the latest so let me explain to
you what I mean so NPM install low - at
four point one four so what I mean to
say here is that give me low - package
with major version for minor version one
for but the package worship the sorry
the patch version
give me the latest so when they run this
command and I needed to use - - save so
let me also do that again
so now wait all right let's do it
- - save and it's going to install low -
four point one four and then it's going
to take the latest patch version so - so
four point one four and in this minor
version - is the latest patch version so
that is how you install a specific major
and minor version but with the latest
patch version and finally we can also
specify just the major version so give
me the latest package of low - with a
major version of four so the command is
going to be not sure if you can have a
look ok so NPM install low - at 4 - -
save so when I run this command it's
going to install the latest major
version of 400 - so 4.1 4.2 gets changed
to four point one six point one so
in version major version 4 this is the
latest work
this is the latest version of miner and
patch and that is how you install
specific versions of NPM packages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
