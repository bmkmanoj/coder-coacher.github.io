a view instance using the view
constructor so under the CDN create a
new script tag and within the script tag
we create a view instance so while we M
is equal to new view instance we are
going to have parentheses and within the
parentheses we are going to have empty
curly braces you can name the variable
anything you want to but we M stands for
view model and that is the convention
used to refer to our view instance so I
will be using the same and I will write
the view J s code in the HTML file
itself so that it is easier to relate
between the HTML and the JavaScript but
you can just as well create a separate
javascript file and reference it in your
HTML now this view instance that we have
just created accepts a JavaScript object
the different properties of this object
is what we will be learning in detail in
the initial part of the series the first
option you can specify is the e l option
the e l option or L option specifies the
HTML element to which this particular
view instance should be associated to so
let's create an HTML element so in the
body tag I'm going to create a div tag
with an ID is equal to my app within the
div tag a heading that says maybe hello
which was and then now that we have an
HTML element we can associate it to the
view instance so for the e l option we
specify the ID like the CSS selector so
within quotes hash my app this is
basically a CSS selector that selects
this particular div tag now when you run
your application the HTML generated Dom
for this div tag will be replaced by the
view generated Dom and view takes
control of this particular div tag so
make sure
you associate your view instance with a
dip tag and not directly to your body
tag
so now let's save our file go to our
browser and refresh it and you should
see hello vishwas so our very first view
J's application is up and running but if
you notice we have a static text hello
vishwas
now what if we want it to be dynamic
that is we want the name to be
data-driven for that we make use of the
template syntax and the data property so
every view instance has a data property
which allows you to define the data for
that particular instance of this data
property again is just a plain
JavaScript object so here's how we make
use of the data property after the île
option we are going to say data of this
data is just a plain JavaScript object
so within a pair of curly braces you can
have name value pairs
now I'm gonna say name and this is going
to be which was now have that we have
our data we need to change our template
and in mu J's the template is basically
the visual part of the application it is
valid HTML with a few additions to the
syntax which makes it possible to bind
data from the view instance to the Dom
alright to bind a name data to our HTML
we make use of what is known as the
mustache syntax which is nothing but
double curly braces so instead of
directly typing which was within a pair
of double curly braces we are going to
type the name of the data property which
is in our case name itself let's save
this and refresh our browser and you can
see that it still renders hello vishwas
and if I inspect the element you can see
that there are no curly braces you
replace the name data with its actual
value and if we for example change our
name property with vishwas and an
exclamation sign and save it and refresh
our browser you can see that hello
with an exclamation is also rendered
again now of course we are changing the
data manually right now but this would
probably be driven by a REST API or a
web service so this is a very basic
getting started application with view
J's we have created an HTML element we
have created a view instance we have
associated this view instance with this
particular div tag using a CSS selector
with the e l option we also have data
for this particular view instance and we
are binding this data to our HTML using
the mustache syntax so again just a
basic application with the template and
data binding next let's take a closer
look at this data property and the
different ways to bind our data to the
template I'll see you guys in the next
