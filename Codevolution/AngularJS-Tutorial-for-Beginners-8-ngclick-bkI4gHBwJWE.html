us learn about a new directive called
ng-click
now ng-click tells the angular
application what has to be done when an
HTML element is clicked
for our example let us just create a
small button that is going to increment
a click counter by one every time it is
clicked now inside a div tag create a
button element to button ng click at the
director is equal to count is equal to
count plus 1 now close the button tag
then type click and then the end tag now
let us go ahead and use a paragraph tag
to display the count count is count
let's also go to our controller and
initialize count does kill dot count is
equal to zero save it go to your index
file save it when you reload a file it
says click and then count is zero you
click it says count is 1 2 3 4 5 and so
on
now ng click can also be combined with
other directives for example ng-show and
ng-hide let us have a small example on
how that works out in a controller
create another variable called dollar
scope dot show and set it equal to true
and create another function dollar scope
dot toggle show and assign it a function
now what the function does is it is
going to flip the value of the shell
variable between true and false
so show dollar scoop show is equal to
not dollar scope show so if it is true
it set it to false and if it's false
it changes it to true go back to our
HTML file add another functionality to
inchi click the semicolon and type
toggle switch sorry
toggle show now we are going to display
the count depending on the show variable
here so if the show is true and let's
display the count and if the show is
false that is not split account so ng
show as equal to show as we see here
so go ahead save it say your AB - s go
to your browser reload it now when you
click and it's gone
when you click again the count is 2 now
when you click again the show variable s
turn defaults so count as 3 but it is
going to hide it
false true sorry false true false true
and so on now similar thing can be done
with ng-hide change it reload it
initially it is going to be hidden and
when you click it it's going to show one
click hide show/hide show so that's how
you use and you click and you can also
use any click with other directives so
just ng-show and ng-hide that's it for
now and thank you for watching dont
forget hit the subscribe button and i'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
