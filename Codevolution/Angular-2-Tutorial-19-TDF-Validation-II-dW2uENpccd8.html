video we learned about the required
field validation and there are a couple
more built-in validations that angular
supports so the next one is the min
length attribute so we're here in the
input element for name I can specify min
length attribute and assign it a value
of 4 so this means to say that the name
form control needs to contain at least 4
characters and if not the condition or
the state is going to be invalid so
let's head over to the browser and see
how that is going to affect our 4 so
right now name is invalid because it is
a mandatory field and will not accept a
blank value so let me assign a value of
quality to this name so now it is going
to change to green because the phone
control is valid but here's the thing
let me remove three characters so that
the form contains form control only
contains three characters but it is
going to display please enter a name so
this is something that is not right so
let's see why that is happening so if
you have a look at our div tag we are
displaying please enter a name only
based on whether this form control is
valid or invalid and right now it is in
the invalid condition because it does
not contain 4 characters and hence
please enter name as displayed so what
we need to do is dig a level deeper and
analyze whether this min length
attribute is causing the error or the
required attribute is causing the error
and then display the appropriate message
so let's try let's see how to fix that
I'm going to replace this div tag with
another div tag and this is going to be
making use of the structural directive
ng-if so this div tag is going to appear
in the Dom only based on a certain
condition what is the condition the
condition first one is that this input
element so name ref has to contain
errors so dot errors is going to be true
or false and then we're going to say
that this is going to be logically
combined with
name ref dot dirty which means to say
that the value has been changed for this
input element or name ref dot text that
means to say that the user has at least
touched or navigated to this input
element so now we can also add this
class so class is equal to alert alert
danger
so that we get a good read box and
within this we can analyze what the
condition or what is causing the error
so another div tag this div tag is going
to be hidden now when is it going to be
hidden so we're going to have not off
named ref so named ref dot errors dot
require now we are going to say please
enter a name so if this required
attribute is causing the error we're
going to say please enter name if it is
not causing the error then we are going
to hide this now similarly I'm going to
copy this and add another div tag that
is going to indicate whether the error
is caused by the min length attribute so
name ref errors dot min length please
enter at least 4 characters so now we
can save this and head over to the
browser let's see if it rectifies now
initially the name is invalid because it
is blank and I'm going to add quality
again so now it is valid because it
contains 6 characters and I'm going to
remove three characters and there you go
please enter at least four characters so
this is the right error message that we
need to display and if I remove all the
characters it is going to say please
enter a name so based on which attribute
is causing the error we are able to
display the appropriate error message
and similarly the next attribute or
validation we can perform is max length
so I can assign max length a value of 10
and this is going to restrict to 10
characters and again you can create a
div
that says name ref errors max length and
says please do not exceed 10 characters
but I'm going to leave that to you so so
far we have three validations required
field validation a mid-length validation
and a max length validation now another
final validation we can perform is
pattern matching so let's say that our
postal code right here needs to be five
digit number so pattern is the attribute
and the regular expression is we're
going to start off with a number that is
going to be one two nine between or one
between 1 and 9 and then we're going to
follow that up with four more numbers
that are between 0 &amp;amp; 9 so 4 and then
that is going to be the end and then
let's also assign a reference variable
so - ref let's go with pin code and this
we need to assign to ngmodel so why are
we doing this that is because we need to
get hold of this errors property so just
like name ref equals ng model we are
going to have ref pin code equals ng
model and now I'm going to simply copy
this div tag and paste it underneath
underneath this input tag and we're
going to just change name ref with pin
code so this over here and then over
here and then over here this and we
don't need this div tag anymore alright
now we are going to basically see that
instead of required attribute that is
causing the error pattern attribute is
causing the error if that is the case
please enter a five digit number so
let's save this and have a look if it
works
so right now postal code is fine because
we have not entered anything but if I
navigate if I enter let's say 1 it's
going to say please enter a five digit
number now if I enter a five digit
number it is going to be fine and if I
remove it so four digit it's going to
say please enter a five digit number so
let me make it
five digit and let me also enter a name
quality and there you go we have a valid
form all right
that pretty much covers validations with
template driven forms so thank you guys
for watching and don't forget to
subscribe I'll see you guys in the next
