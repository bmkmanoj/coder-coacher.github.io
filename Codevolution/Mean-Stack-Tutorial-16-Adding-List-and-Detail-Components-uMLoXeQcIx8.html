to add the final two components of our
application which are the video left and
the video detail components now we will
just create the skeleton of the two
components in this video and we will add
the functionality in the subsequent
videos so first let's generate the two
components open come on come again in
the ng app folder which is the project
folder and the command and Gigi C
followed by the component name it is
going to be video list similarly we are
also going to generate in sheet GC video
detail so this should create the cube
component within the app folder
so within source within app we should
have video list and video detail now I'm
going to just edit the selected for
these so this is going to be just video
list and then the video detail selector
is going to be just video detail next we
are going to nest these two components
within the video center component so in
inside video center.com paint dot HTML
I'm going to copy/paste some code and
explain what each line is alright so
again we have the bootstrap class row
and then the column so what basically
this does is 75% of the width is going
to be allocated to video detail
component and then the remaining 25% is
going to be allocated to read your list
component and this is going to make much
more sense once you see the demo at the
end of this video alright now let me
also quickly change the home component
to display a Jumbotron so that it
doesn't look plain so let's go back to
home home component HTML and over here
just add a class of Jumbotron and then a
heading of video player all right now we
can build our application and
test to see if it works properly so anti
build let's go back to the browser and
over here when i refresh it should say
video player inside a Jumbotron and when
I go to playlist on the left hand side
we have video detail work and on the
right hand side video list works so the
video details takes up 75% and with your
list takes up 25% so that is what the
bootstrap styling does alright in the
next video let's display an actual list
of videos so thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
