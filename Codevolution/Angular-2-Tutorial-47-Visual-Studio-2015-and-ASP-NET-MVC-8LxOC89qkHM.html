demo a basic hello world angular 2
application using Visual Studio 2015 and
asp.net MVC now I'm going to walk you
through the different steps of creating
the application and also some of the
errors that I encountered during the
setup and all the necessary links that
I'm going to be making use of in this
video are in the description down below
so make sure to check that now the first
step is to make sure that you have vs
2015 update 3 or higher and the way to
check that is go to visual studio click
on let's see help
and then about now over here you should
be able to see update 3 now if you don't
have Visual Studio 2015 at all then you
can go to the first link in the
description and download Visual Studio
community edition now this is a free
edition and once you install it you
should have update 3 right away and if
you already have Visual Studio 2015 but
not necessarily update 3 then use the
second link so over here you can click
on download Visual Studio Update 3 and
this is just going to install update 3
in your existing Visual Studio so that
is our first step our second step is to
install typescript for Visual Studio
2015 so again click on the link in the
description and you should be navigated
to this particular page over here click
on Visual Studio 2015
now it should start downloading the
setup file go ahead install it and you
can make sure alright so yeah make sure
that you don't have any errors that is
our second step step 3 is to download an
install node so again go to the link in
the description no js' or RG /e and
slash download and select the
appropriate version of node for your
machine now once you install node it is
also going to install NPM for you step 4
is to configure Visual Studio 2015 to
use NPM so go back to visual
studio click on tools and then options
over here select projects and solutions
and then external web tools and here you
should be seeing that the path variable
is the third entry or inside the third
position so select the path variable and
click on the up arrow mark to bring it
to the second position and then you can
click on ok now once you do that make
sure you restart your visual studio the
next step step five is to create an MVC
project so again go to file new project
and then you can click on web and then
asp.net web application and over here
make sure you select MVC now I've
already created one so I'm just going to
open it again so file open project
solution angular MVC demo and I'm going
to open that so once you open this
make sure you rebuild your solution so
rebuild it now for our next step we are
going to bring in the angular
application so again in the link go to
my github page and over here you should
be able to see a repository called
angular 2 tutorials so download it and
extract it and you should have access to
all these particular folders we are
going to be making use of angular
version 2.2 template so open that in
your file explorer and you should be
seeing all these files so just copy
everything so ctrl C go back to visual
studio make right click on your maybe
project and all the way at the bottom
you should see open folder in File
Explorer so we're here I'm just going to
paste all the angular 2 files that I've
copied so copy and replace the favicon
as well that is fine so that is our
sixth step now for our step seven we
need to include only the required files
in our project so in the solution
Explorer click on this show
all files button now over here we are
going to first right click on app folder
and then say include in project and you
can click on no for the dialog box and
then similarly on package.json right
click alright this seems to take some
time so right-click and then include in
project and then styles dot CSS right
click include in project and tears
config dot JSON right-click and include
in project now we need to install all
these angular dependencies so right
click on package JSON file and click on
restore packages now this will take a
couple of seconds or a few minutes so
once the installation is complete
we are going to have to rebuild the
solution and I'm going to move on to the
next step and then come back to this
once the rebuilding is done so the
eighth step is to add angular code for
the view so again go back to my github
repo and in angular 2 tutorials I have a
file called code for asp.net so click on
that now there are two orders code that
we need to be we need to include in two
files the first one is layout dot CSS
HTML and I'm going to copy this
everything in between this angular 2
code so copy come back to visual studio
and then over here I'm going to go to
views and then we're here shared and
then layout dot CS HTML
all right over here I'm going to just
under scripts dot render I'm going to
paste what I have copied and this is
basically all the references for that
angular 2 is going to require alright
and then once you do this the second
step is to copy the rest of the code
copy it and then go to index dot CS HTML
so in views go to home folder and then
index dot c sh c as HTML so we're here
just replace the entire file with the
code that you have copied from my github
page so now I'm going to save alright
I'm going to save this and I'm also
going to save underscore layout dot CSS
HTML and we are going to wait for NPM
install to restore all the packages all
right there you go NPM completed with
exit code zero and installing packages
is completed so now I can go and
right-click on the solution and then
rebuild solution so when the rebuild
happens we should not have any errors so
let's give it a few seconds to rebuild
there you go we have rebuilt all won
succeeded so now I can click on debug
then maybe we can start without
debugging so there you go
angular 2 QuickStart and from our
component we have hello angular so we
can just make sure that go back to our
app folder and over here AB dot
component TS and you should have hello
angular so name is equal to angular we
are using interpolation so hello name
which is nothing but hello angular which
is what we see over here so that is help
you set up angular 2 application using
Visual Studio 2015 and asp.net MVC
alright so before we wind up I'm going
to point out some of the errors that I
faced while setting up the project now I
had Visual Studio 2015 but not update 3
so when I install update 3 there was an
error when I tried to create a new MVC
project and the solution was to just
reinstall NuGet package manager or if it
was removed just install it the second
error I faced was trying to restore
packages so right-clicking on package
store JSON and clicking on restore
packages if the package manager shows
you an error it is probably because you
don't have admin privileges so make sure
that you are running Visual Studio as an
administrator or with admin privileges
the third one is if you're not able to
run as an admin or you were able to
restore packages but when you rebuild
the solution it says that typescript
can't find angular / core or similar
packages it is because the bin folder or
the binaries folder wasn't created in
node underscore modules folder so in
that case you can just run NPM install
from command prompt in the package dot
JSON folder and finally if everything
everything was successful but when you
try to run your project you get an error
in the browser
that says this particular runtime error
because it cannot find one of its
dependencies just go to your temporary
folder so in C Drive Windows
microsoft.net framework your version
temporary asp.net files just remove all
the all the or just delete all the temp
files now this should solve it if this
doesn't then go to your temp folder by
just typing this in your file explorer
and removing all the files there as well
