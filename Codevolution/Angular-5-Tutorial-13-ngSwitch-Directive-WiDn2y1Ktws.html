your switch statement in any programming
language the only difference here of
course is that you render HTML instead
of executing some logic well you
basically use ng switch when you have to
compare against multiple values so let's
take a look at the syntax with a very
simple example I'm gonna show you a
switch statement that displays if you
picked the color red blue or green first
let's create a new property let's call
this color and initially let this be set
to red in the template I'm going to add
a div tag that behaves like a container
for all the switch cases and this
container is the element that we attach
the ng-switch directive to so within
square brackets type NJ switch to this
we assign an expression and in our
example it is going to be the color
property now within this div tag we
specified the switch cases with ng
switch case so I'm gonna copy paste the
three cases in the first case we are
going to check if the color is red so
the syntax is star and then in this
switch case is equal to red so checking
with the red color if this is true this
element gets rendered which says you
picked red color similarly we are also
going to check with blue and green
so ng switch case is equal to blue or ng
switch case is equal to green and the
corresponding text you picked blue color
or you picked green color now since we
have picked the color to be red if we
save this and take a look at the browser
it says you picked red color and if I
change red to blue in the browser it
says you picked blue color now sometimes
you might want to handle the scenario
where the expression doesn't match any
of the cases and for that we use ng
switch default so I'm going to add a new
div tag and this contains star ng-switch
default and then the text
is pick again so if the color doesn't
match either red blue or green this
particular div tag will be rendered so
let me change the color to orange if I
save this and take a look at the browser
it says pick again which is the default
case so that's all there is to the
ng-switch directive let's take a look at
list rendering in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
