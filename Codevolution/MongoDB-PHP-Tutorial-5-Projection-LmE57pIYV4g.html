we are going to quickly learn about
projection so what I've done is copy the
code from fine dot PHP and created a new
file called projection dot PHP so we
have our client variable which is an
instance of the MongoDB client class we
have the company DB selected we also
have the employee collection selected
and then we use the find method on the
employee collection to select all the
documents that have a skill field set to
MongoDB and then we are storing it in
the document list then we iterate over
the document list and then dump it out
so when we go to our browser and save
projection dot PHP then ctrl you we have
the two documents which have a skill
MongoDB so that is ID one Andrew and
then ID to Brad so what projection
allows us is we can include or exclude a
specific field from a document while
querying for it for example let's say we
just wanted the name field from each of
these two documents so name Andrew and
name Brad only to be displayed and
nothing else so for that we can make use
of a second parameter to define method
this is going to have the keyword
projection so what do we need to project
this again going to be an array we just
want the name so name set to one now
let's save this and reload our browser
there you go we have named andrew named
brad the age and the sky fields are not
displayed anymore however we still have
the ID field now this the default
behavior ID is going to be displayed
unless explicitly mentioned not too so
for that if you want to hide the ID
field just use so dollar underscore ID
and then set it to zero
now save it and refresh it and there you
go the ID field is hidden now we just
have the name Andrew and name Brad so if
you want to include a particular field
in your query just assign it one and if
you want to hide explicitly use zero so
that's pretty much it about projection
thank you guys for watching and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
