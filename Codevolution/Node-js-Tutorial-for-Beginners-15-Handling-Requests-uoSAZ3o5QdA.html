to building our application and so far
we have a server that takes requests we
also have a router to route the request
so just to recollect if we have let's
say we run node app Dargis and we make a
request to a review page it says request
received for review and then routing a
request for review and if you make a
request to our home page it says request
received for home routing a request for
home now all we need to do is handle
these requests so let's create a new
module con called handler so new file
and save it as handler da GS let's put
it at the end ok let us first create two
functions one to handle a request to the
home page and the second to handle a
request to the review page so function
home and let's just console dot log
executing home handler all right and
then a second function so a function
review and this is going to be executing
executing review handler
now let's go ahead and expose these two
functions so experts dot home is equal
to home and then experts dot review is
equal to review now how do we make the
router aware that these two request
handlers exist well we're going to start
off from our app dot J's again because
this is the entry point for application
is going to include all the modules so
variable handler is equal to require now
since this is a module that we have
created a dot slash and then handler now
how do we assign a handler for a
particular path for that we are going to
be making use of the key value pairs of
our object or the name value pairs so
let's create a new object called handle
and then assign it empty brackets now we
can say that handle has a name so let's
say the name is home then called handler
dot home which is the home function and
handler module so by using the name
value pairs of an object you are able to
assign a handler to a path name so
similarly we can have handle of review
and this is going to be equal to handler
dot review now that we have included the
handle object let's go ahead and pass
the handle object so in our start server
function a second parameter called
handle now that's great we have passed
this additional parameter so let's go
back to our server dot J's module and
modify the code so next to our route we
are going to pass handle and within
this route function route pad name let's
again specify the handle so route of
handle happening now now that we have
specified the handle parameter to our
route module so let's go back to a route
function let's go back to our router
module and modify the code no we also
have on the handle parameter again now
after we say that a request received for
pad name let us first check if a handler
exists for the particular patterning
so if whoopsie type off let's say handle
and this is going to have the paddling
and triple equal to and then function
then we are going to call appropriate
handler so handler sorry handle no
happening then there's going to be a
function okay if there is no handler
then we're going to say console dot log
no handler or this particular pad name
now let's go ahead save handler dodges
save right oh yes save services and say
yes let's restart so node app dot j s
it's going to start the server let's
refresh our home page URL and let's see
what happens so request receive for home
routing a request for home and then
executing the home handler
so let's trace it out and see how this
works
when we run our app yes it is going to
call the start server function of the
server module and in a start server we
are going to be passing the route
function from the router module and then
this handle object which contains the
corresponding handler for every URL so
once the start server is called and goes
into your server module and first it is
going to extract the path name using the
URL module and then we are going to be
passing the handle object and the pad
name so when it encounters this route
handle come apart name and goes to your
router yes excuse me and here first we
check if a handler exists if at all it
exists so right now our path name is
whole so handle of home is triple equal
to a function so if you go back to our
app yes we have handle or foe so it does
exist so if it exists we are going to be
calling the appropriate handler so
handle of pad name is going to be handle
off hole and handle of hole has a value
handler dot hope that means to say the
home function and the handler module so
the execution gets transferred to the
whole function and it is going to log to
the console executing home handler now
if you have a look here we also have the
Fame I can't request but we don't have a
handler for that so it says request
receive for fav icon routing a request
for flavor corn but no handler for
favicon so we have in a router dot yes
if you don't have a handler then we are
going to log no handler for path name
now let's excuse me let me quickly show
you another one so let's say we have
handle and it's going to be just a
forward slash and once again it is
possible to assign the same handler to
multiple URLs so once again let
a sign handler dot hell save it save
everything all right now if you go back
cancel it and start the server again and
instead of the home we can just have the
forward slash and if you check in our
comment drop it says request received
for just a front slash routing a request
for just a front slash but we are going
to be executing still the home handler
so that's how you handle requests that a
router is going to route and in the next
video let's make our handler respond to
the browser request so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
