are going to learn about directors now
there are three directives in angular2
the first one is a component which we
have been learning all along the second
one is a structural directive which we
are going to learn in this video and the
third one is attribute directives which
we are going to learn in the next video
now this video we are going to be
focusing on learning structural
directives which are responsible for Dom
manipulation in angular 2 now there are
three built-in structural directives and
the first one is the ng-if directive so
let us understand with an example how
MGF works so here in my class I'm going
to create a new property called show
element and assign it true now back here
in my template I'm going to create a new
paragraph tag and then close the
paragraph tag let's just type it let's
just type show element
okay now directives are going to live
within the HTML tag kind of like a
custom attribute so here within our
paragraph tag we use the syntax star and
sheet F which is the engi directive and
for this we are going to assign the show
element property so show element so the
ng F accepts a boolean value to make a
piece of Dom appear or disappear based
on this value so right now our show
element is true so when we save it and
the browser is reloaded it is going to
display our paragraph so show element
now the same if I change true to false
here in entry if it is going to be
evaluated default and the paragraph is
going to be hidden and there you go
we don't see the show element text in
our view anymore
now the second structural directive we
are going to learn about is ng-switch
now just like programming languages
where we use switch cases to execute
some code based on a certain condition
in angular 2 we use ng switch to display
or hide Dom elements based on a certain
condition
so to understand ng ng switch let me
create a new property called color and
assign add red as the color now back in
our HTML let me create a new div tag so
du and then close the div tag now within
our div tag again we are going to be
using ng switch and the syntax is within
square brackets we are going to be using
ng switch and on the right hand side
what it has to be evaluated against so
here the property is going to be color
so based on what the color is
let us show or hide certain paragraphs
create a new paragraph
now again within the paragraph tag again
this is part of the ng-switch directive
we use star ng switch when now this is
again going to take a value on the right
hand side and this is a string value red
and red color is shown on the red
paragraph is shown so let me just copy
this so that we can have another color
so instead of red let's make it blue and
let's say it that the blue color is
shown and finally we can also have a
default case so ng-switch default when
none of the colors match let's just save
invalid color okay so now what happens
is that we have our color property red
so in the div tag ng switch is equal to
color so color is replaced by red and in
the paragraphs it is going to check what
the color is since it is red the
first paragraph is going to be displayed
and the remaining paragraphs are not
going to be displayed so if I have a
look at the browser it says red color is
shown or the red paragraph is shown now
if I change this to blue and save it
then we have blue color is shown as the
paragraph blue color is shown and
finally let's change it to green let's
save it and it says invalid color which
is the default condition of the default
case so there you go that's how
ng-switch works and finally we have the
ng4 directive which is a repeater
directive so let's say if we have a list
of items or for example a list of colors
that need to be displayed then what we
are going to do is define a block of
HTML to display just a single color and
then angular is going to work its magic
and repeat this HTML element for each of
the item in that array so again let me
show you with an example so that you can
understand more easily so let's create
an array of colors so colors is equal to
red let's have blue and let's say green
now let's try to display these items in
our HTML so underneath the div tag we
are going to have an unordered list of
items so ul and ul now in an unordered
list we are going to use the Li tag to
specify each item so li and then Li now
usually we would have three alight tags
to display each of these colors but by
using the ng for director which has the
syntax star and g4 let me change this to
star ng 4 is equal to let color of
colors I'm going to explain this in a
moment
interpolation color now save this and
when the browser is reloaded you have an
unordered list of the colors array so
how this works is that for each item in
this colors array we are going to
iterate it and each time we are
iterating we are going to assign it to
color so in the first iteration it's
going to be red then it is going to
change the blue and then it is going to
change the green and then we are going
to use interpolation to actually output
the value to our view so ng4 is a
repeater directive which is going to
iterate through the elements of a list
and then you can perform some operations
based on each of the item in that list
so these are the meet three main
built-in directives or structural
directives in angular 2 in the next
video we are going to learn about
attribute directives so stay tuned thank
