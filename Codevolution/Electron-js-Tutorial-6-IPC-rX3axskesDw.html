electron has two types of processes a
main process and a render process an
electron app can have one main process
and one or more renderer processes now
sometimes the render process might want
to invoke a native desktop API for
example the dialog box to display an
error message or the dialog box to open
a file save a file and so on
now when the web page or the browser
window has access to these native api's
it is considered dangerous the resources
might be leaked so to handle this
electron has the IPC module IP C stands
for inter process communication and in
our case the communication is between
the main process and the renderer
process so let me explain the general
concept behind IPC and then we can see a
demo on how to implement it in our
electron application let us consider the
example where the renderer process has
to display an error message in the
browser window so to achieve that using
IPC here's what we are going to do the
render process sends out an event open
error dialog to the main process the
main process should be listening to this
particular event open error dialog and
when it catches that event it will show
the dialogue by calling the native API
so the renderer process sends a message
to the main process and the main process
called the native desktop API and the
main process can also reply to the
renderer process that sends out a
message so it sends out an event opened
error dialogue back to the renderer
process and in the renderer process we
need to listen to opened error dialog
and capture the arguments and perform
any operation or in our simple example
we are just going to load the reply from
the main process so that is the basic
IPC flow in electron the renderer
process sends out an event
the main process the main process then
calls the native desktop api's and then
the main process can replay back to the
render process and the render process
can listen to that particular event and
perform some operations alright with
this understanding let's take a look at
the demo now again we are going to start
with the basic hello world project in
the package.json file I have changed the
name to IPC and index dot HTML have
changed the title and the heading to IPC
the first thing we are going to do is
within the body tag add a script and
over here we are going to require index
Dodgers so let's create this index dot
J's which runs in the renderer process
so index dot J's next we import the IPC
modules in both the main and the
renderer processes so in main Dodgers
we're going to say Const IPC is equal to
electron dot IPC main and similarly in
index dot J's we're first going to
require electron Const IPC is equal to
electron dot IPC renderer next we are
going to add a button in our HTML file
and when we click this button we want an
error dialog box to pop up so just below
the h1 tag add a button let's give this
an ID and this is going to be error
button and then the text is going to be
display error next and index Dodgers we
are going to listen to the click event
on that button and send out an event to
the main process to display the error
dialog box so over here Const error
button it's equal to document dot get
element by ID enter button and then we
are going to say error button dot add
event listener this is going to be a
click event and then a function to
execute and within the function we are
going to use the IPC module so IP c dot
send and then the name of the event so
I'm going to say open
error dialog so now
we are sending an event from the
renderer process to the main process
next in the main process we are going to
listen to the event and display that
dialog box so to display the dialog box
first we need to make use of the module
from electron so Kahn style aughh is
equal to electron dialogue and then to
listen to that event we are going to use
the IPC module so it is going to be IPC
dot on and then the name of the event so
it is going to be open ever dialogue and
then the function now this function has
event as a parameter and in the body of
this function we are going to say
dialogue dot show error box of this
takes in two arguments the first one is
a title let's give this an error message
and then a body so demo of an error
message all right so what you have done
so far is we have sent a message open
our dialogue from the renderer process
and we have captured that event open
error dialog and we are executing this
function and what this function does is
it shows the error dialog box so let's
run this and test it out so open the
integrated terminal navigate to the
project directory run npm install if you
haven't already and then run NPM start
so if you have a look at the UI we have
our h1 tag IPC and we also have our
button display error now when I click on
this button you can see that we have an
error dialog box the title is an error
message and then the body is demo of an
error message and I can click on OK so
we are able to communicate from the
render process to the main process now
let's do it the other way let's send a
message from the main process to the
render process on the same event so we
are replying to the open error dialog
event so I'm going to close this and to
reply to this
particular event within the function
body we are going to say event dot
center dot send then we are going to
reply with the name of the event or the
channel and this is going to be opened
error dialog and then a message to the
render process so we can say main
process open the error dialog and in the
index dot JS file let's capture that
particular event so IPC dot on opened
error dialog and then a function this
function is going to again have event as
the last argument let's just log this
argument now this argument is basically
the reply from the main process let me
quickly summarize the flow from index
dot J's we are going to say IPC dots and
open error dialog so this event is being
sent from the renderer process to the
main process so in the main process we
listen to open error dialog and then
actually show the error message so the
title is an error message and the body
is demo of an error message now to reply
back to this event we have the event
argument so event dot sender so who is
the sender of this event this particular
render will process so to this sender
send back a message so this is the
channel on which I will be communicating
so opened error dialog and this is the
message that I want to send
so back in index dot J's we are going to
listen on opened error dialog which is
basically this right here and then we
also get access to the argument which is
nothing but the message that we have
sent from the main process to the render
process and we are just logging in to
see if it works so now when I run NPM
start and I'm going to click on View
toggle developer tools and now when I
click on display error message I get the
error message and when I click on OK
we get the replied main process open
there
dialogue so we are sending a message
from the render process to the main
process and a reply back from the main
process to the render process
this is IPC inter-process communication
we have the main process and the
renderer process communicating with each
other now when it comes to IPC there are
two types a synchronous and synchronous
asynchronous IPC does not block other
operations whereas synchronous IPC locks
other operations while completing its
tasks so let's understand with a very
basic demo the non blocking versus
blocking nature of asynchronous and
synchronous IPC I'm gonna close this and
the error dialog example we just saw is
in fact an example of a synchronous IPC
I'm gonna make some minor adjustments so
that we can relate to the example better
in index dot HTML I'm going to change
the ID from error button to a sync
button in main Dodgers I'm going to say
instead of open error dialog async
message instead of open error dialog it
is going to be async reply and in index
dodges we are going to change error
button to a sync button open error
dialog to async message and open a
dialogue to async reply and in the main
process we don't really want to open an
error dialog box anymore this was just
for understanding IPC all right so our
main and renderer processes are
communicating to sure that they're
asynchronous I'm just going to add to
console dot lots so in index dot J's
just before sending this asynchronous
message I'm going to log to the console
async
message one and right after sending the
asynchronous
message I'm going to say async message
to to the console so now let's run this
and test the output so NPM start I'm
going to open developer tools and then
I'm going to click on display error so
if you have a look in the console the
order of messages we first get message 1
then methods 2 and then the asynchronous
message reply in our code however IPC is
between message 1 and methods do but
because this is asynchronous the IPC
code does not block other operations so
the rendering process sends out a
message to the main process and then
allows the next line to be executed so
that is white message 1 and methods to
appear first and then when the
asynchronous reply is received it is
logged to the console let's contrast
this with synchronous IPC so in index
dot HTML I'm going to create a new
button this is going to be synchronous
button and I'm also going to change this
to a sink and sink and in index digest
we are going to add a similar event
handler so sync button dot add event
listener on click we're going to say
sync message 1 sync message two and make
sure you also get a reference to the
sync button so const sync button is
equal to document dot get element by ID
sync button and then sending and
receiving a reply using synchronous is
slightly different so instead of just
IPC dot sin here's how the syntax is
going to be we're going to say const
reply is equal to IP c dot send sync and
then sync message and then we are going
to say console dot log reply and in the
main process over here i'm going to say
IP c dot on
sync method this time we're going to
have a function this is going to have an
event and we are going to say event dot
return value is equal to sync reply so
this syntax is slightly different for
synchronous versus asynchronous so for
synchronous we're going to capture the
reply in the same line as we are sending
out the particular event so we say IP c
dot sensing synced message it goes to
the main process we receive or listen to
the sync message and then we say a
return value for that particular event
so this is going to be sync reply which
gets assigned to the reply and then
logged in the console let's run this and
have a look at the output so NPM start
I'm going to toggle developer tools
again and I'm gonna click on sync button
so if you have a look now the order of
execution is exactly the same as our
code we have message 1 and then the
reply and then methods to this is
because synchronous IPC blocks execution
till it completes so till it locks that
reply the next line will not be executed
so let me also click on a sync button
where you can see that message one
message two and then the reply is logged
so the order is different for a
synchronous versus synchronous because
of the non-blocking versus locking
nature so that is about synchronous and
asynchronous IPC in electron and one
last thing that I need to speak about is
the remote module now we learned that to
invoke native api's IPC is required
between the main and the renderer
process but electron also provides the
remote module to make it simpler with
the remote module you can invoke methods
of the main process object without
explicitly sending inter process
messages now in one of the earlier
videos about the main and the renderer
process we saw that we could
create a browser window from the
renderer process using the remote module
let's recollect so in index dot J's I
can type Const browser window is equal
to require electron dot remote dot
browser window and then I can type let
window is equal to new browser window
and then window dot load URL the link to
github so if I run the application now
NPM start we get two browser windows
this browser window was created in the
main process and this browser window was
created from the renderer process now
what happens is each object returned by
this remote module represents an object
in the main process so this browser
window is actually from the main process
and when you invoke methods of a remote
object you are actually sending
synchronous inter process messages so in
the example here both browser window and
window are remote objects and new
browser window did not create a browser
window object in the renderer process
instead it created a browser window
object in the main process and returned
that corresponding remote object in the
renderer process namely this particular
window object and this happens with
synchronous IPC so when we run this
application the renderer process will
create the new browser window with the
help of the main process using
synchronous IPC now you might ask then
why do we need IPC at all if it is
handled internally we could just use the
remote module now keep in mind the
remote module handles IPC synchronously
so there might be occurrences when you
are actually having nothing on your
screen because of the blocking nature of
synchronous IPC so as much as possible
stick to a synchronous IPC in electron
alright so that is pretty much about IPC
and make sure you get a good
understanding of IPC because it is a
very
pardon concept in electron and yeah
