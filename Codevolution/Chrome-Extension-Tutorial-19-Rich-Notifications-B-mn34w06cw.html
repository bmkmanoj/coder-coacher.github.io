need to use my full screen so if the
font is not quite clear I recommend you
to watch it in full screen and in HD and
let me also increase the size and let's
see if that helps out okay so now that
we have a total and a limit in place the
next step is to inform the user when
they exceed their allotted limit and for
this we make use of notifications so
first we need to in the manifest specify
a permission for notifications so comma
and then notifications alright now we
have the permission and we can use this
and pop up dodges to inform the user
when they exceed their limit so we're
going to start off over okay let me
close this okay so apart from retrieving
the total now we also need to retrieve
the limit so it's going to become an
array so along with the total we're
going to retrieve the limit so now over
here when we are setting the new total
we can have a callback function that is
going to check there's going to check if
the new total exceeded the limit so
first we're going to say if there was an
amount entered and the new total is
greater than or equal to the budget dot
limit so if the new total is greater
than or equal to the limit when you
change this then we need to send a
notification to the user so first we are
going to create a notification options
object so note if options and this is
going to be an object we're going to
specify first a type and there there are
a few types of notifications but I
recommend you to go over the chrome
developer website to learn the different
types of notifications we are going to
be sticking to the
seek one so type is going to be basic
and then we can also specify an icon URL
watch it with the icon that we display
along with the notification and this is
going to be icon 48 dot PNG the next
property we are going to specify is the
title so what should be the title for
the notification we're going to say
limit reached and we can specify a
message for this notification so the
message is just going to say Oh looks
like you've reached your looks like
you've okay let me let me put this and
looks like you've reached your limit
okay so that does it for our
notifications object now we can use a
chrome API to create a notification so
chrome dot notifications dot create and
this takes in two parameters the first
one as the ID for this notification and
let's call this limit not've and the
second parameter is this object so what
are the options for this notification
and we have specified this already using
this not've options object so now let's
save this go to our browser and reload
this because we did change the
permissions and we have a limit of 100
let me enter 50 and click on spend and
that's fine let me click on 50 and spend
again and there you go a notification
over here limit reached Oh looks like
you've reached your limit and this is
the icon so this is the basics of how
you create a notification you can have a
notification object and then use this
chrome dot notification start create
with this lot of options to create your
particular notification
just to get the hang of notifications
let's also notify the user when the
total is reset to zero so let me go to
options dot GS and over here when the
user clicks on this reset total button
let's have a callback function so
function and we're going to be doing the
same thing again we're going to just
copy this notifications and edit it so
copy go to options paste it so type is
going to be basic it's daikon is going
to remain the same the title let's
change this to total reached sorry total
reset and then the message let's just
say total has been reset to zero all
right that must that must be quite
sufficient let's save this let's go to
the browser and let's go to options page
right now we have a total of hundred I'm
going to click on reset total and there
you go total reset total has been reset
to zero and if I click the total has
been reset to zero so that's the basics
of notifications and again I recommend
you to go over to the chrome developer
website to learn the different types of
notifications you can create the other
ones being you can specify an image as a
notification or a list of messages as a
notification but yeah that's pretty much
that's pretty much the basics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
