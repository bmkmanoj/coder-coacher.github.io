see how to work with MongoDB and PHP now
assuming that you know PHP you know a
bit of MongoDB you have downloaded and
installed Sam and you have downloaded
and installed MongoDB so if you're ready
with all that let's get started the
first thing is to download and install
the MongoDB driver for PHP so I'm gonna
be downloading the P at the MongoDB
driver from the eval link which I'm
going to be using it which I'm going to
be dropping in the description as well
so select the latest one and click
download now it takes a few seconds not
sure okay
so once it is downloaded go ahead and
extract it now when you extract that
gives you several dll's to choose from
and sometimes this can be a bit
confusing let me walk you through how to
select the appropriate one excuse me
so I have a 32-bit machine and the x64
dll's are for 64-bit machines as well so
I'm gonna go ahead and remove the 64-bit
dll's the next thing is NT s and T R
stands for I believe node thread-safe
or something just ignore those as well
so I'm gonna be D selecting the NTS
dll's now we are down to four so one
point six point eight is the same across
all of them the next one is five point
four five point five and five point six
which is the PHP version of Zam that we
have downloaded so if you go ahead and
start Sam I pass your server and if you
open localhost
and go - phpinfo you get the PHP version
as five point five point three zero so
in a selection I believe we had five
point four five point five all right
yeah so we had these four selections out
of which five point four and five point
six can be ignored since we have a
version of five point five as you see
here and finally we have BC nine and we
see eleven so that's the visual studio
compiler I believe so if you see here
compiler ms we see eleven so I'm gonna
be ignoring vc 9 and we see 11 as the is
the DLN that we want so go ahead copy
this and go to see dry sam go to the PHP
folder go to extensions or ext folder go
ahead and paste this here now once you
have pasted it just copy finally and go
back scroll down we have the PHP okay
development reduction so we have the PHP
dot ini which is configuration settings
file so let's go ahead and edit that do
a find on windows extensions alright so
we are here now these are the list of
the allowances that are currently active
and some of them are commented out
they're in alphabetical order
so let's go ahead and add mango before
my SQL so we have to type extension
is equal to and paste the final name dot
d ll go ahead and save it now we need to
verify if the DL if the driver is
working properly so let us go back to
Zam htdocs create and it with notepad
alright let's just leave index as it is
create a new file called smile save us
so let's say Longo PHP dot PHP all right
so let's say dollar so we need a Mongo
client to establish any interface or
connections to the Mongo server the
dollar M is equal to new Mongo client
dollar DB is equal to dollar M object
operator Bert so we are going to use a
database called birds so that's what it
does and say echo connected to database
words ok let's go ahead and save this
let's start come on Trump and start
Mongo the instance now go to localhost /
Mongo forgot the file name one of the
PHP dot PHP so Mongo PHP dot PHP
class monocline not found online - all
right sorry I have to stop and start the
server again for the changes to take
place right now let's say right so
connected today with database Birds
all right so now we have downloaded the
MongoDB driver and we have written a
basic PHP script to connect to the
database so thank you for watching in
the next video let's see how to insert
some documents into the database bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
