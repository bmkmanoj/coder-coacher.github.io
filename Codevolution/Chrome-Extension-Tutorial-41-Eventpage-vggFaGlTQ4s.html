do the exact same thing we're gonna head
over to our wicked extension and copy
this even page onto our speakit folder
and now I can open the same and Visual
Studio code and edit it so the first
thing we need to change is the context
menu item ID I'm gonna change from
wicked to speak and then the title is
going to be speak with an uppercase s
now the context is going to remain the
same so whenever we make a selection we
want this menu item then we use the
context menus create API to create our
menu item now the next step we are going
to remove this function and Cody alright
because we are not working with your
else anymore and over here when a user
clicks on our context menu item we are
going to listen to the event and first
we make sure that our ID matches so
you're going to change the wicked to
speak and if there is some selection
text so then we need to do something so
I'm going to remove all of this and
replace with a single line and this is
going to be a new chrome API chrome dot
TDS dot speak and this basically speaks
out something and what do we want - what
do we want the Chrome browser to speak
whatever is the selection text so click
data dot selection text and we can also
specify options and I'm just going to
specify the rate at which it is going to
speak and I felt that one was relatively
fast so I'm gonna go with point seven so
now our extension is ready let's go
ahead and load it out in our browser so
load X load unpacked extensions and
speak it I'm gonna click on OK and now
we have our extension speaking so now
I'm gonna select let's say I must select
speak the selected text I'm gonna right
click I get this option to speak and I'm
not sure if you guys can hear what it
speaks but I'm gonna give it give it a
shot anyway
okay I'm gonna turn my volume up all the
way and then let's let's do this again
the selected text all right there you go
our extension is now working and there
are there are several different options
you can specify over here and again I
asked you to go to the
developer.chrome.com/apps IDE to learn
more about Chrome DDS dot speak well
that's it another quick extension that
makes use of text-to-speech so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
