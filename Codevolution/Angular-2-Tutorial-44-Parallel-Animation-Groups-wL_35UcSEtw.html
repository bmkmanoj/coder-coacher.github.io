44 of the angular 2 series now so far we
have seen how to animate different style
properties but all at the same time so
what if you want to animate different
properties for different intervals of
time maybe with different delays and
also with different easing functions so
for that purpose we can make use of
animation groups so let's have a look at
an example and just to save us some time
I already have the code typed out so I'm
going to walk you through this code now
we have a div tag like before and this
is going to have a class room so this is
the element that we are going to animate
now this div tag also has a trigger
called group trigger which is nothing
but the animation that we are going to
apply and this is assigned a room state
that is going to change with this toggle
button so we have our button toggle
lights and over here if you have a look
in our class toggle lights is going to
change this room state variable between
the states off and on so these are the
two states assigned to our animation
finally the interesting and the new
concept for this video which is
animation groups so over here we have
the animations defined so the trigger is
going to be group trigger which is
nothing but what we have specified here
now this animation has two States off
state which is characterized by a black
background color and on state which is
characterized by a white background
color now we have the two transitions
off to on and on to off but here's the
change instead of specifying a single
animate function and changing all the
properties in this single animate
function we are using this group keyword
and animating with different animation
functions so group can take in an array
of animate functions so make sure you
import the group keyword over here from
angular slash core and then specify over
here now I have to animate functions the
first animate function
is going to rotate the div element by 90
degrees and this is going to happen for
a duration of 4 seconds with ease in
function and the second animate we have
is we are going to change the width of
div element to 50 pixels and this is
going to happen for a duration of 2
seconds with ease our function so two
different properties are getting
manipulated at different intervals of
time for different durations and
different easing functions and they all
happen for this same transition off to
on similarly for on to off transition we
are using the group keyword and we are
specifying an array of animate functions
so over here we have to animate
functions the first animate function is
going to rotate by 360 degrees
and it is going to happen for three
seconds with a delay of one second and
ease in function and we have another
animate function but it's going to
change the opacity of div element to
zero and it is going to be applied for a
duration of four seconds so different
properties animated for different
durations with different delays and
different easing functions that is the
use of this group keyword so the code is
going to be available in my github repo
you can download it and have a look at
it anytime you want to but for now
let's go ahead and have a look in our
browser so I'm going to refresh this so
initially it's in the off state so off
state which is characterized by black
background and when I make a transition
from off to on I need to see two
animations rotate by 90 degrees for 4
seconds and width should be changed by
250 pixels but this is going too quickly
happen in two seconds so let's have a
look I'm going to click on toggle lights
in twos against the mid became 50 pixels
but over a period of 4 seconds it
rotated and at the end of 4 seconds when
it reached on state it is going to be
background color white so let's have a
look at the second transition from on
back to off so we need to see two
animations here
the first one it needs to rotate by 360
degrees for a period of three seconds
with a delay of once again and for a
total time of four seconds we are going
to see opacity is going to be zero now
over here let's have a look I'm going to
click on this so it's going to change
opacity four seconds and then it is
going to rotate after a delay of 1
seconds for the period of 3 seconds so
it was like a kind of disappearing
effect with rotation and once the
animation is done it is going to come
back to the off state with background
color black now these are just sample
animations that I am going to have shown
to you you can go crazy with your
imagination you can have any animation
that you want to but just remember if
you want to animate different properties
for different amount of time for
different delays and different easing
functions make use of group keyword to
run them in parallel alright so that is
pretty much what I wanted to show in
this video thank you guys for watching
don't forget subscribe and I'll see you
all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
