37 and in this video we are going to
learn how to redirect ads using angular
strauder now in the last video we
configured the empty pad so when we
navigate to just localhost colon 3000
the department list component is going
to be displayed but a better way to do
this and avoid duplication of routes is
to just redirect this route to
Department so when there is an incoming
request for an empty path we will just
redirect it to this departments path and
this path is going to display the
department list component which is
exactly what we needed in the first
place so to redirect we are going to use
a property called redirect to so instead
of specifying component we are going to
specify the path to which we need to
redirect to and that is departments and
I also need to add a front slash but now
if we save our application and head over
to the browser and let it reload you see
that we get an error and our application
does not work and the error is basically
telling us please provide path match now
whenever we redirect we need to include
an additional property called
PAP match so let's go ahead and specify
that in our code so to this redirect pad
we are going to have a path match
property now if this path match is going
to accept two values or either one of
the two values the first one is prefix
and the second one is full now to
demonstrate how the two values are going
to affect our application let me use one
value at a time
now the first value is prefix and when
the value is prefix it means that apply
this route or apply the redirect if the
prefix to the URL is the path specified
or in simpler terms if the URL
begins with this empty string then
redirected now the problem with this is
that empty string is a prefix to every
single URL so any URL that you enter it
gets redirected to Department list
component so let's have a look in our
application I'm going to save this and
when the application reloads so there
you go it was initially I'm going to
provide blank on an empty string and it
redirects when I click on employees
it doesn't navigate to employee list it
still redirects when I click on angular
it still redirects that is because every
single URL slash employees or slash
Department slash ID for every URL the
prefix is empty string so that is why it
is going to redirect it every single
time
now the second value is the full value
so anytime you use redirect make sure
that you use a path match value of full
so this basically means only when the
entire URL or the full URL is blank then
redirect to Department so let's save
this and go ahead and have a look I'm
going to just enter low close 3000 then
it navigates to slash departments or
redirects to departments and the
department list is displayed and if I go
to employees employee list is displayed
and if I click on angular angular
Department detail gets displayed now the
application we have is pretty small and
that is why I have explained redirecting
with an empty path but in a full-fledged
application make sure that anytime you
redirect it has a path match of full
unless of course using path match of
prefix is your intention so anyway
that's about redirecting and the paths
match property thank you guys for
watching I'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
