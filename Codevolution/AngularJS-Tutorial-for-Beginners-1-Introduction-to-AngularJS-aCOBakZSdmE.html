and welcome to your very first tutorial
series on angularjs now if you're
watching this video you're probably in
one of the two categories the first one
you know what angularjs is why it is
used and you're here to learn how to use
it or you have no clue what English s is
at all it doesn't matter because once
you're through with these videos you're
gonna be in a position to create your
very own angularjs application and
understand all the core concepts in
angularjs now before we proceed I need
to mention though that in order to learn
angularjs you need to be familiar with
HTML CSS and JavaScript you did not need
to be familiar with things such as
Python PHP Ruby on Rails and all those
back-end stuff however let's get started
now what exactly is angularjs angularjs
is a client-side JavaScript framework
for adding interactivity to your HTML so
angularjs tells your HTML code when to
call a particular piece of JavaScript
code now why would we want to use
angularjs we can use angularjs
to create single page applications we
can use it to create dynamic and
responsive websites we can use it to
create new testable code with it also
helps us organize our JavaScript code
all in all with angularjs you can code
very little for a lot of functionality
now to get started with a little chairs
the first thing we need to do is go
ahead and download it
so type angularjs in Google and click on
the first link or just type HTTP
angularjs to RG and once you're here
click on the download button now we're
going to be making use of the CDN for
this so triple click on the CDN it
doesn't matter if it shows a warning
sign go ahead and copy it and open a
text editor of your choice
is create a new HTML file let's go ahead
and save this as index dot HTML so index
dot HTML now let us write some simple
lines of code the first one is dark type
HTML and let us insert our HTML tag let
me quickly change my indentation to 8
now let us go ahead and create our head
tag and within the head tag the title
tag and let us give the title as angular
angular is that right yes
angular Jess then create our body tag
now put in a body tag we need to create
a link to the city and we just copied
then we're going to be making use of the
script tag so script the type will be
'text slash javascript and the source is
going to be the link we just copied so
go ahead and paste it and save it now we
have included angularjs in our index dot
HTML file now to verify if index sorry
if angular is working go ahead and add
ng app to your body tag and just below
your script tag type double curly braces
and within that type hello world
separately so hello concatenated with
world go ahead and save it now let's go
ahead and open index dot HTML and we see
hello world which is a concatenated
string now you don't have to worry about
andshe app or what this curly brace does
at this point of time it was only to
verify if your angular JS download is
actually working
so that's how you download angularjs to
your HTML file in the next video let us
focus on some of the core concepts and
angularjs thank you for watching I'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
