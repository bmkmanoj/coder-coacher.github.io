will have a look at the model driven
approach to creating forms in angular 2
now again we are going to start off from
scratch with the hello world template
and you can find the template on my
github repo and the link is in the
description down below so the very first
thing we need to do is import reactive
forms module from angular slash forms so
over here in AB dot module dot ES I'm
going to have an import statement and
we're going to import reactive forms
module and this we are importing from
angular slash forms and now we also need
to include this in the ng module
decorator so next to the browser module
we are also going to include the
reactive forms module so anytime we use
the model driven approach we need to
make use of reactive forms module all
right now in model-driven forms as the
name suggests a form is represented by a
model and this model is responsible for
handling all the user interactions with
the form so let's start by creating the
model first now we are going to be
making use of two classes to create the
model the first one is a form control
and the second one is a form group so if
you want to create a single control then
we make use of the form control class
and if you want to group together
multiple controls then we make use of
the form group class and since every
form is a combination of one or more
form controls a form is inevitably a
form group and we are going to be
creating the exact same form that we did
with the template driven approach so we
have a name and email street city and
postal code so each of these
individually are form controls and then
we are going to logically group street
city and postal code into a form group
called address and again the entire form
on its own is also a form group so let's
see how this translates to code
translate to code all right so I'm going
to go back to AB component es the first
thing we need to do is import the two
classes that we need so it is going to
be forum group and form control and this
we are going to import from angular
slash forms so angular /font all right
now we can create the model so we're
here and class AB component now we need
to give a name to this model and I'm
going to call this user form and
remember each form is also a form group
so this user form is going to be an
instance of form group so new form group
and this form group is made up of five
form controls so the first one is the
name so new and this time instead of
form group it's a form control and
similarly we're going to have email
which is a new form control and then we
are going to have address so remember we
had logically grouped three controls
into a group so this address is going to
be a new form group so form group and
this form group is in turn made up of
three controls the first one is Street
so this is going to be a new form
control and then you're going to have
the city so this again going to be a new
form control and then finally we're
going to have the postal code which is
again a new new form control all right
now we have our model ready
and that means angular is going to
transform this model into HTML and
display it on the browser well if you
thought something similar I'm sorry but
angular is not that powerful even with
the model driven approach we still need
to create the HTML form and you might
wonder why is it termed as the model
driven approach them and I will answer
that question in the next video
but now let's proceed by
creating the HTML form for this model so
I'm going to change the template to
template URL because I want the file to
be in or I want the HTML to be in a
separate file and the file is going to
be an app slash AB dot component dot
HTML I don't know why that happens it's
going to change this to AB dot app AB
slash AB component HTML and to save time
I've already created this ab dot
component HTML file and this is exactly
the same HTML that we use for the
template driven approach now when I save
this and head over to the browser you
are going to come across this error so
no provider for control container so you
are basically going to not view this
template and this is because anytime we
use the model driven approach we need to
bind every form tag with a model so
right now this form over here is not
bound to any model so let's fix that so
to bind the HTML to the model we are
going to use a form group directive so
form group and then we need to assign it
to the model and the model is going to
be user form now if you have a look in
AB component es we have it as user form
and that is what we have used over here
so now when I save this and head over to
the browser we are going to get user
data and the five form fields all right
now we have bound the form to the model
but now we also need to bind each of
these form controls to the individual
form control in the model so for that we
are going to be using the form control
named directive so I'm going to hide
this so control shift e control shift E
or control B okay yeah so I'm going to
add form control name and then assign it
a value so let's call this input element
name now I'm going to do the same for
each of the other four inputs so let's
copy paste paste again and finally one
more time alright now we have name we
have email and we have street we also
have the city and then the postal code
but if you have a look at AB component
yes we have logically grouped these
three into address so over here I'm
going to add another div tag and this
div tag I'm going to add a directive
called form group name and this is going
to be equal to address and then I'm
going to shift these three fields inside
that form group so let's paste it over
here and let me just indent this alright
that should be good
so now if you have a look address is
going to correspond to address and then
within address we have street city and
postal code so form control name Street
city and postal code so now we can
capture the value from each of these
input fields so again we are going to
listen on the ng submit event which is
going to be fired when the submit button
is clicked so ng submit and we need to
assign a handler so on
submit so instead of retrieving the
value from here because this is not a
template driven approach we are going to
retrieve the value in the app component
so we're here I'm going to create on
submit and we are going to log to the
console so console dot log this dot user
form which is the model name dot value
so now let's save this and have a look
at our browser and I'm also going to
open the console
let me just decrease this so name let's
go with Rob and then Rob
email calm then Street Baker City London
and then the postal code one two three
four five so when I click on submit
we're going to get this object over here
let me see if you can view this okay
name is going to be Rob email Robert
email comm and an address as we wanted
it is going to be an object so address
is an object and when it expanded city
London postal code one two three four
five and Street is Baker Street so that
is how you create a model table I create
a form with the model driven approach
and retrieve its value and you can also
have default values that are going to be
filled in to each of these so a form
control takes parameters and the very
first parameter is the default value so
over here if I let's say I want a
default value of Brandon I'm going to
save this and when the page is reloaded
and it's going to have that initial
value of Brandon and that is how you
actually bind data instead of in the
template of an approach of course you
use property data binding but here you
need to specify a default value to the
form control and again two-way data
binding is not a feature with model
driven forms so there you go how to
create model driven forms how to
retrieve value for model driven forms
and how to supply default values to the
form fields in model driven forms and we
will have a look at validating these
forms in the next video so thank you
guys for watching and I'll see you guys
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
