HTML attributes such as ID class style
and even boolean attributes such as
disabled for an input or a button
however we cannot use the mustache
syntax for HTML attributes instead view
provides another directive namely the we
bind directive now this directive can be
used to bind data property values to
HTML attributes let's take a look at an
example now back here in visual studio
code we have an empty div tag and to
this div tag we have associated a view
instance and this view instance
currently does not have any data
properties so let's go ahead and create
a new data property I'm going to call
this my ID and then this is going to be
set to the string data ID now let's
create a new HTML element so that we can
bind to the ID attribute so I'm going to
create an h1 tag and for the inner HTML
I'm just gonna provide data ID now I'm
gonna add a new heading tag so that we
can bind to the HTML element so h1 and
I'm just gonna call this code evolution
and to bind to the ID property we're
going to make use of the V bind
directive followed by a colon followed
by the attribute to which we want to
bind now this is going to be in the ID
attribute for this we need to assign a
value and this value is nothing but the
data property which is going to be my ID
so my ID so just to reiterate to bind to
the ID attribute we use the V bind
directive followed by a colon followed
by the attribute name and then to that
we assign a data property which in that
case is my ID so now if we save this and
refresh our browser we can see that code
evolution heading appears and if I
inspect the element you can see that it
has an ID of data ID and if you go back
to visual studio code that is the value
of this particular data property so data
ID is going
be replaced over here at one time let's
also take a look and see what happens
when we change the value of my ID in the
browser so I'm gonna go back to the
browser in the console I'm gonna type VM
dot my ID and then I'm gonna set this
equal to test ID now if I go back to the
elements panel you can see that the ID
attribute of this particular h1 tag has
been updated to the new value test ID
now let's take a look at another example
I mentioned that the B wine director can
be used to bind to boolean attributes as
well so let's create a new property I'm
going to call it is disabled and then
set it defaults now over here I'm going
to create a new button tag and to this
pattern tag we're going to use the
rebind directive again but this time we
bind to the disabled attribute of the
button element so we bind to the
disabled attribute is disabled property
let's save this and refresh our browser
and check what happens so i refresh it
you can see that in the button element
the disabled attribute is not present
this is because is disabled property is
set to false if I go to the console and
change the data property value so VM dot
is disabled is equal to true you can see
that the bind button is now disabled and
if I go to the elements panel you can
now see the disabled attribute present
for the button element so that is the
basic gist of the binds directive it can
be used to bind to HTML attributes now
most of the time in your application you
are more likely to bind to the class or
style attributes so let's take a
detailed look at binding to classes and
styles in the next few videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
