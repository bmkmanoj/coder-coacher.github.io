to test the registration API with
postman postman is a tool with which you
can add the very minimum test api's it
allows back-end developers to test their
api s-- without actually having to rely
on a UI to send the data and that is
exactly what we want at this stage of
our application we want to be able to
test a registration API even though we
don't have a working user interface with
a registration form so let's see how to
do that go to get postman comm download
and install postman once the
installation is successful sign up with
a new account or login with your Google
profile you should then be able to see
this screen alright now it is time to
test our registration API before that
let me quickly restart node server now
if you wish to you can use node montt to
automatically restart your node server
whenever there is a change but I'm okay
with manually restarting the server for
every API so it's completely up to you
so I'm going to open the terminal and
I'm going to navigate inside the server
folder so CD server and I'm gonna run
the command node server now back in
postman first we select the request
method registration is a post request so
select post then we enter the URL so
this is going to be localhost colon 3000
slash API slash register next in the
header step we are going to set the
content type so content type is going to
be application slash JSON and the last
step is to specify our user data so go
to the body tab select raw
and then we are going to have our user
object so this is going to be JSON
format within a pair of curly braces the
first property is email I'm going to
have a at a comm and the second property
is the password and I'm just going to
leave it at a now I'm gonna hit on send
and if I scroll to the bottom you can
see that the response status is 200 okay
and we get back the details of the
registered user email password and the
auto-generated ID so the user is
successfully saved in MongoDB if I go to
em laughs and take a look at the
documents so in database events DB in
collection users I'm going to click on
users in the documents we can see the
new registered user email a at a comm
with a password of a alright now that we
have a working registration API next
let's create an API for user login</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
