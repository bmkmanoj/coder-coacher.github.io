we are going to be learning about - a
data binding in angular so let's say a
user is entering a form then it is
possible in angular to have a live
preview using to a data binding
so we can change our data property and
simultaneously display the data properly
in our view for example let's say we
have two input fields the user is going
to enter let it let that be the first
name so first name and a last name
okay now the user is going to enter that
as a form so let's create two and put
boxes and we'll type is equal to text
and another and cut for the last name so
type is equal to text okay so in angular
whenever we have to make use of two-way
data-binding then we make use of the ng
model directive so we assign to the ng
model the property which we want to bind
so ng model is equal to first name and
code of course and the second ng model
is equal to the last name now ng model
has to be wrapped with parentheses and
square brackets so parentheses and
square brackets and why if you recollect
we had event binding specified by
parentheses and property data binding
which was specified by these square
brackets so this is - a with data
binding you're going to be making use of
both event binding and the property data
binding so whenever the first name and
last name properly changes the view is
getting updated and whenever the view
changes that property gets updated so
let's use interpolation to display this
as a
preview so we are going to have a first
name and last name now when you save
this and the browser is reloaded and we
are going to have two input boxes over
here and then the full name which is
going to be automatically displayed when
you start entering something so let's
say hello and if you live if you check
here it is going to have it is going to
behave like a live preview hello world
so that is how to a databinding works
and in the next video let us start
learning about directives so thank you
guys for watching don't forget to
