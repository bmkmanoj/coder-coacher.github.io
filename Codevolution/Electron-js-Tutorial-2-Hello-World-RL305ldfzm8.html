create our very first electron
application but before we get started
with code we need to make sure that we
have installed node.js so good to know
goog and click on Windows installer or
Mac installer whichever is appropriate
for your machine so download know just
and install it and when you install node
NPM is also installed for you alright
once that is done we can get started
with our application now I will be using
visual studio code as editor for this
particular series I have a folder
created called electron and all our
projects will be within this folder so
for our hello world projects I'm going
to create a new folder and name it hello
world now the first thing we need to do
is create a package to a JSON file for
our project so within the hello world
folder we're going to create a new file
and name it package dot JSON over here
we are going to add three simple entries
the first one is a name and this is
going to be hello world then we are
going to add the version for our project
so version and let's give it an initial
version of 1.0 and then finally we are
going to specify a main entry point to
our application which is going to be a
JavaScript file named mania and we will
be creating this file pretty soon now
once these three entries are done we
need to install electron package and add
it over here as a dev dependencies now
you can choose to use command prompt or
git bash but for running the command I
will be using the integrated terminal in
Visual Studio code so click on View and
that integrated terminal now over here
we are in the electron folder so
navigate inside the hello world folder
CD in the world over here I'm going to
run the command npm install' electron -
- save that them to install it and save
it as a dev dependency
all right now electron is installed
locally and we also have an entry in our
package JSON files as a dev dependencies
finally to run our electron application
we will add a script entry over here I'm
going to add a comma and then scripts
now this script is going to be just one
single script for now which is going to
be start and when we run NPM start we
are going to execute electron in this
current particular folder so that does
it for our package JSON file a name a
version the main entry point the
dependencies and finally the scripts
that can be used to run our application
the next file we need to create is this
particular main dot JS file so again
within hello world project create a new
file and name it mania now this main dot
JS files for our basic hello world
application is responsible for creating
a window and handling the different
events on that window so let's dive into
some electron code but first let's begin
by checking if main dot J actually
executes so I'm going to just add a
console dot log and then within
parentheses I'm going to say main
process working so now in the
projects folder over here I'm going to
run the command NPM start
you
and if you see it is internally going to
execute electrons in this current
project folder which is going to execute
main dodges and we receive the output
main process working all right I'm going
to hit ctrl C to cancel this now that
the main dot JS files is working let's
start by requiring the necessary modules
for this basic electron application so
the first thing is electron so const
electron is equal to require electron
now this is from the node modules
package that we installed locally
then we are going to require two sub
modules from electron so app is one of
them so this is going to be equal to
electron tap and we also need a window
for the UI so this is going to be
browser window so console window is
equal to electron dot browser window in
addition to this we are going to use
some built-in modules we are going to
use hat module to build our file path
this is going to be required path and
similarly to ensure that we are building
an appropriate URL we are going to use
the built in URL module so require URL
alright so here is the thing when the
user loads our desktop application they
should see a view of a window that
represent the UI of our application so
let's add some code to create a new
window that represents the UI we are
going to start off by declaring a
variable so let's wim and this is going
to be the reference to our window next
we are going to define a function that
is going to create a window so function
let's call this create window now
electron actually provides this browser
window API to create and control windows
so let's use that window is going to be
equal to new browser window so we have
now an instance of this browser window
after a new browser window is created we
need to load an HTML file into that
browser window the HTML is the UI that
the user can do and this is where we
make use of the path and URLs built in
modules so we are going to say window
dot load URL over here we need to
specify an appropriate or properly
constructed URL so we are going to use
the built in module URL and then we are
going to invoke the format method now
this format method takes in a JavaScript
object
and the different things we can specify
are the pathname and this is where we
are going to again use the past module
so pad join and we are going to join
with the existing directory
a file named index dot HTML we will be
creating this very soon next we are
going to subscribe that the protocol is
a five vertical because we are serving
our file from the file system and not
HTTP and then finally we specify that
slashes are set to true all right so we
have created a new browser window and we
have loaded index dot HTML into that
browser window lastly we need to handle
the event when the user closes the
browser window because a user can close
your application right so we are going
to say window dot on and then specify
closed so this is an event that is going
to be emitted when you click on the
close button so if the window is closed
we are going to use the es6 syntax have
our functions we are just going to set
window is equal to null so that it can
be garbage collected ok we now have a
function that creates a browser window
but when do we call this well this app
sub module in electron has an event
called ready which indicates that all
initialization is done and we are
allowed to execute certain code so we
can make use of that over here we are
going to say app dot on ready create
window so when the application has
finished initialization you are going to
call this create window function alright
if you are working on a Windows machine
this is pretty much your main dot J's
file if you are on a Mac however you
need to add a bit more code so let me
just quickly copy/paste that so the
first one is if all the browser windows
are closed
you need to explicitly quit the
application in your code so AB dot on
Windows all closed
so if all the windows are closed this
particular event system emit
it and we are just going to force quit
our application and similarly in max if
there are no windows open and you click
on the dock icon you need to create the
browser window again so AB dot on
activate
so you're activating the application
basically we are going to call the
create window function so that a new
browser window is created all right so
now our packets are JSON and our main
digest file already so let's add this
index dot HTML file to our project so
we're here create a new file index dot
HTML and over here just as the basic
HTML I'm just going to change the title
over here I'm going to call this hello
world app and over here in the body in
h1 tag I'm going to just despite hello
world because this is a hello world
application
all right that's it that completes our
very first desktop application using
electron so let's run this now over here
in the Electra in the visual studio
integrated terminal I'm going to run NPM
start
all right we got an error and that was
because I had misspelled electron so I
have corrected it and now let's run NPM
start again
so there you go we see that the browser
window is created this white screen that
you see is the browser window and we
have the h1 tag that says hello world
and we also have the title that says
hello world app and since this is a
desktop application we have the menu
like file edit view window help by
default we also have this minimize
maximize and close buttons and what is
interesting is because this app uses web
technologies we even get access to the
web developer tools so over here in
create window function I'm going to add
just before window dot on clothes window
dot web content dot open dev tools so
when we invoke this it is going to open
dev tools in the browser window
so let's restart our application ctrl C
and then NPM start all right so if you
have a look we have elements we have the
body tag we have the h1 tag and we have
the console sources network and so on so
we have access to the regular dev tool
panels in our desktop application which
will be really helpful when debugging so
this is a basic electron application and
from here on I will be using this
application as the base application and
this on top of this to help you
understand the different concepts of
electron so make sure you download this
from my github repo and run npm install
to get you started let me quickly
summarize what we have done so that you
again get a good idea of how electron
works so initially we start with the
package JSON files we have a name
version and the entry point to our
application then we install electron
locally using NPM install command which
creates a dev dependency and finally we
also add in a script entry so that we
can run electrons by just writing or by
just exit
npm start now when you run npm start it
is going to execute this main dot JS
file so in the main dot JS file we are
going to start off by requiring the
electron module and from the electron
modules we make use of the app sub
module and also the browser window sub
module the browser window is basically
responsible for all the UI related part
of our application and the app sub
module basically runs in this mint Egeus
handling any events that are necessary
we also make use of path and URL modules
to build an appropriate URL for this
window to load the index dot HTML file
so we have this create window method or
function which is going to create a new
browser window instant and load the
index dot HTML file now we call this
function only when the application is
ready otherwise it might not work as
expected and for Mac specifically we
have some extra bit of code now in our
index dot HTML file we just specify a
title and within the body tags we just
specify an h1 tag that says hello world
and when we run the command NPM start we
get a nice browser window with the title
with the h1 tag and we also get access
to all the developer tools so there you
go using web technologies we have
created a desktop application now we
have plenty more concepts to cover so
