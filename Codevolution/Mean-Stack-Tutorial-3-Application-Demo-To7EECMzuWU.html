to build is a simple video player
application of this application by
default renders the home page and the
home page just had welcome to video
player you can navigate to the videos
page by clicking on playlists in the
navigation menu we are going to use
angular routing to navigate between the
home page and the videos page the video
page has two components a video list
component and a video detail component a
list of videos are displayed on the
right and clicking on a particular video
will display the details of that
particular video we are going to use
input and output properties data binding
and event binding to achieve this you
can create a new video by clicking on
the new video button over here you can
enter the title a URL and a description
and you can click on save to add a new
video
now once the video is added a new title
is also going to appear in the video
list component if you are unhappy with
the description you can change it and
then click on the Update button to
update the video you can even change the
title by clicking on this which then
turns into an input text box and change
the title if you're unhappy or if you
want to delete a particular video click
on the particular title and click on
delete and this is going to delete the
video from the video list as well so we
will be using angular services to
implement the create read update and
delete operations now that you know what
we are going to build let me quickly
show you the prerequisites for this
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
