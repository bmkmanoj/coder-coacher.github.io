I want to talk a bit about organizing
our code now in no chess organizing code
by creating modules is very important so
in our previous video we created a
server dot J's file which is actually
going to be our server module and in
this video let's create a main file
called AB dot J's which is going to be
the entry point for our application and
to turn our server ma server file into
module let us wrap around the
functionality with another function
let's say function start server and we
can export it using export dot start
server is equal to start so start server
and let me just all right save it and we
are going to be creating a new file
called AB Dodgers so abdallah s and in
our app dot yes we are going to be
requiring all the modules for our
application and the first one is going
to be a server module so very well the
server is equal to require and since it
is our own module and not a built-in
module we need to use the dot and the
slash which specifies the current
directory and then server now that we
have imported the server module we can
go ahead and create up call the function
so server dot start server now save up
yes save server yes let's say we just
change hello from our server module now
save it now if you run our MJS instead
of server yes because we are how we have
decided that up
jess is going to be the entry point for
our application we see that the service
started on localhost port 80 dated and
when you refresh this it says hello from
our server module so that's how we
create modules and import them into our
main file and this is really important
to understand how to organize your code
because it is going to help you in
understanding the Express framework and
a much easier way so thank you guys for
watching and in the next video let us
see how to deal with routers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
