how we are going to tackle the angular
application we are going to begin by
generating a new angular application
using angular CLI in the next video we
will add the various components and
configure routes to navigate to them we
will be adding a navigation bar in the
UI after that we will build the
registration UI and the service to
interact with the backend API similarly
we will also build the login UI and the
service to interact with the backend API
after that we are going to build the UI
for both regular and special events
fetching the data from the backend at
this point any user will be able to view
both types of events regular and special
so we will add authentication to make
sure users are logged in before being
able to view the special events finally
some code cleanup with UI logic to
conditionally render login and logout
buttons alright that's pretty much it
let's complete step 1 in this video
generating a new angular application
using the CLI so go back to visual
studio code and open the integrated
terminal in the angular auth folder run
the command ng new ng app - - routing
the command takes a few minutes to
execute and creates a folder called ng
app which contains all the files needed
to start a simple angular application to
run this application navigate inside the
ng app folder so CD ng app and run the
command ng serve - OH
the - o option opens the application in
a browser right away and there
we have our angular application up and
running with just two commands now that
we have a basic application ready in the
next video let's add the different
components configure the routes and add
a navigation bar to navigate to the
different routes using mouse clicks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
