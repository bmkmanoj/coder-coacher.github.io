recollect in MongoDB we have a database
and each database is made up of
collections and each collection is in
turn made up of documents now in this
video let us learn how to insert
documents into a collection within a
database so I have created a new file
called insert dot PHP and I've just
included the require piece of line ok so
to insert to insert a document we have
two methods one to insert a single
document at a time and one to insert
multiple documents at a time
so let us understand what examples these
two methods now first let's create a
client variable dollar client is equal
to new MongoDB slash client now once we
have the client we can access the
database so dollar company DB is equal
to dollar client or company DB now this
is the database that we had created in
the previous video now within the
company database we can select the
collection so dollar employee collection
is equal to dollar company DB and then
employee collection ok so far we have
created a client we have the database
selected and then we have the employee
collection selected let's go ahead and
insert documents within this particular
collection so to insert a collection or
to insert a single document I mean to
say we use the insert one method so
let's create insert one result as a
variable and this is going to be equal
to dollar employee collection employee
collection and object operator and then
we use the insert one method now this is
going to have
take an array so over here we have let's
say name and this is going to be equal
to let's say Ethan then we also have an
age as a field so let's say 28 and Ethan
also has a skill and he is killed and
let's say bhp okay
now we can save this and we can also
print the inserted count so we can say
inserted percentage the documents and we
can access it using dollar insert one
result and we can use the method get
inserted count okay and we can also get
the ID of the inside a document using
variable underscored dump
we can just say dollar get sorry
insert one result of get inserted ID now
let's save this and see what happens so
let's go to insert dot PHP insert dot
PHP ICU skill ok there is a mistake okay
let's save this let's refresh it so it
says insert in one document and we also
have the object ID which is the string
right here now
if you don't specify the ID field
MongoDB is going to insert one for us
but let's change let's create another
document by specifying the ID so let's
say ID it's going to be underscore and
this is going to be equal to one so now
let's also change the name let's change
it to Andrew at HB 26 and let's say his
killed in MongoDB all right so let's
save this and we have a problem
yeah that's right here save this and
refresh we have inserted one document
and it is going to u1 over here to get
inserted ID so that's how you insert
documents into a collection ok now we
can also insert multiple documents at
the same time so for that we are going
to be making use of insert many method
so let me go ahead and comment out this
so dollar answered many result and this
is going to be dollar employee
collection but this time we are going to
be using the method insert many now this
is going to take an area of document
let's have the first document just going
to copy this over here and let okay
let's have a few more documents okay
let's have five documents so again if
you don't specify the ID it's going to
create it for you but I'm gonna specify
anyway let's have two three four as the
ID
let's have Brad let's have Chris and
let's have Demi
now let the HB 26 30 and 22 we can have
MongoDB let's say no js' and we can have
angular ok so now we can have inserted
percent is the documents now instead of
inside one result we can use insert many
result which is the variable right here
and we can say get inserted count and we
can also dumb the variable result get
inserted ID so there's going to be IDs
over here so let's save this and we have
a problem
insert many result get inserted count
expected printer okay so I need to have
a semicolon over here okay so let's
reload this there you go we have
inserted three documents and the first
object is object ID 2 then we have a
tweet and then we have a four and there
you go we have two three four and we
have three documents inserted so that's
how you insert documents into the
database you use insert one method over
here to insert a single document and use
insert many command or method to insert
multiple documents into the collection
so thank you guys for watching and in
the next video
let us see how to find the documents
inside a collection goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
