binding where the data flow was from the
component class to the component
template any update to the class
property the view gets updated as well
but sometimes to respond to user events
such as most clicks or keyboard events
we need the data flow in the other
direction as well that is from the
template to the class so to capture
events we make use of event binding
let's understand with an example I'm
going to go back to visual studio code
and in the template let's say we have a
button with the text greet when the user
clicks on this button we want to display
welcome to code evolution so we need to
listen to the click event on this button
and here is the syntax within the
opening tag of the element start with a
Dom event you want to listen to in our
example we want to listen to the click
event then enclose this event within
parentheses to this assign the
corresponding event handler and this is
nothing but a method in the component
class let's assign an event handler on
click and then define it in the class so
over here I'm going to type on click and
in this method we are just going to log
to the console
welcome to code evolution so now if we
save this and head over to the browser
and open the console and click on the
grid button you can see welcome to code
evolution so we are binding to the click
event and displaying welcome to code
evolution now it is also possible to set
properties on the mouse click let me
show you how let's go back to visual
studio code and I'm going to add a new
property I'm going to call this public
greeting and initially I'm going to set
this to empty string and then on the
button click we set this property value
this dot greeting is equal to welcome to
code evolution and then in our template
so right next to the button we can use
interpolation and bind to the
reading property now if you save this
and go back to the browser you can see
initially greeting is an empty string so
nothing is displayed but on button click
we said greeting to welcome to code
evolution and this gets displayed in the
view because of interpolation so we are
binding to the click event and then
setting the value of a property in the
component class now sometimes we might
also want information about the event
itself for example information about the
click event for that you simply send in
a parameter in the event handler and
this parameter is dollar event and this
is a special variable for angular the
dollar event gives you all the
information about the Dom event that was
raised so now that we are passing a
parameter to the onclick method let's
also add this over here in our method
definition let's call this event and
instead of logging
welcome to code evolution let's log the
event now let's go back to the browser
and if you take a look at the console
after I click the grid button it says it
is a mouse event so click is a mouse
event and if I expand this you can see
all the information about the event that
was captured the x and y-coordinates the
target the type of the event for example
click event and so on and you can use
any of these in your application for
example I can set the greeting to be
event dot type and when we save this go
back to the browser once it reloads I
click on greet and you can see that it
is a click event so by using dollar
event you can get access to all the
properties of the Dom event all right
finally sometimes when you work with
event binding a separate event handler
may not be necessary for instance in our
example right now the method body is
very small so you can have this as a
template
statement right in the HTML itself so
let me add a new button but this time
instead of assigning an event handler
I'm going to add a template statement
greeting is equal to welcome vishwas
so now if we save this and go back to
the browser
and I click on the second green button
it says welcome vishwas we did not
assign a handler to the click event
instead we have typed the code to be
executed right in the HTML element and
it works just fine well that is about
event binding even binding lets us
capture any Dom event and perform some
action all right thank you guys for

I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
