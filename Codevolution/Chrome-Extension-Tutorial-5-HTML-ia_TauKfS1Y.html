mention two things the first one is that
all the Chrome extensions I'm going to
be creating in this series are already
available on my github page so feel free
to visit my github account and download
them the link to my github page is in
the description down below and the
second thing is that the three icons
which I mentioned in the last video I
have created them and copied to the
hello world folder so the image is
nothing but the code evolution logo this
is the 16 by 16 a 48 by 48 and I also
have the 128 by 128 so pretty simple you
can have any image you wish to have okay
so coming back to your HTML our
extension can have one or more HTML
pages that may represent the UI of the
extension so let's create a basic HTML
page for our hello world extension and
if you remember the default pop up for
our extension is as pop up dot HTML so
let's go ahead and create that I'm going
to create a new file and call this
pop-up dot HTML now over here I'm going
to specify the doctype and this is going
to be html5 okay okay and then I'm going
to create a basic structure head title
and type title is going to be just hello
world and then we're going to have a
body and within the body we're going to
have an h2 tag and this h2 we're going
to give it an ID let's just say greet
and let's just type hello world and
that's it believe it or not we have
created a very first Chrome extension so
let's see how to load this on to Chrome
I'm going to save this save the manifest
save everything now I'm going to go to
Chrome and type Chrome colon from slash
front slash and then extensions now this
is going to take me over to this page
the first thing we need to do is enable
this developer mode so once we enable
that I give this option to load unpacked
extensions I'm going to click on that
and now get to the folder where our
HelloWorld extension is so Chrome
extensions HelloWorld so select this
folder and click on ok so now you see
that our HelloWorld extension is loaded
and you see this icon that shows up in
the toolbar this is the sixteen by
sixteen icon so when I click on when I
hover over this we get hello world and
when I click on this we get the h2 tag
which is nothing but hello world so
there we go
our very first and simple hello world
extension</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
