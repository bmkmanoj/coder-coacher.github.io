point out that I have created a new
folder called page font style and within
the folder
I had three new icons a 16 by 16 a 48 by
48 and 100 by 100 and icon is just the
code evolution logo with a different
background color I kind of messed it up
but anyway these are the three icons
that we will be using for this
particular extension and I have opened
the same folder page font style and
visual studio code and like before our
extension starts with the manifest file
so create a new file manifest dot JSON
alright and now we're going to start off
with a pair of curly braces okay this is
a bit slow okay so first we need to
specify the manifest version so manifest
underscore version and this is going to
be two and then we are going to have a
name for our extension so name is going
to be page font style extension the next
thing we are going to specify is the
version of our extension so the version
is currently going to be 1.0 then we can
have an optional description so
description this is going to be changes
font style on a specific page yeah let's
leave it at that
the next thing we can specify is the
icons that represent our extension so
icons and then this is going to be an
object we need to specify the different
icons so for 1:28 we are going to be
specifying icon 128 dot PNG 448 we're
going to have icon 48 dot PNG and we're
going to be doing the same thing for
sixteen by sixteen excuse me
all right now that we have our icons the
last thing we need to specify is that
our extension is a page action extension
so page underscore action and this is
going to be an object we can specify a
default icon so this is going to be 16
the 16 by 16 so icon 16 dot PNG this
basically the icon that appears in the
toolbar and then we can have a default
pop up the default underscore pop-up and
this is going to be pop-up HTML pop dot
dot HTML and finally we can have a
default title that that gets displayed
when you hover over the icon so default
title and this is going to be page font
style all right that is it for our
manifest file at this point of time we
will come back to this later on and add
a few lines of code as and when needed
so I'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
