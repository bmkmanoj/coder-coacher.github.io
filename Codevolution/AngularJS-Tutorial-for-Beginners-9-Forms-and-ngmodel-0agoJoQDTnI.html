forms and angular now for our example we
will be creating a review form that a
user can use to post review about our
tutorials now the first thing we are
going to do is create some sample
reviews there's a dollar scope dot
reviews is equal to an array of reviews
now let us go ahead and create our first
review the review essays could this be
more awesome
and this was by Chandler Bing
let's go ahead and create another review
and this time the review says have you
doing this was by none other than Joey
go ahead and save it let's go back to
index dot HTML page create a header tag
says reviews and within next we are
going to be creating a div tag and
within the div tag we're going to be
using the ng-repeat directive to iterate
through all the reviews so ng-repeat is
equal to review and reviews once we have
each review let us add some terrible CSS
create a div tag style is equal to
background color and set it to ease
within the div tag let us create the
paragraph tag and we can specify the
comment so use an expression and type
reveal dot comment you can all take your
head
and specify the author you can use a
bold tag and review dot by go ahead and
save it so your app dot J's out the page
and we have a list of reviews first two
views could this be more awesome by
Chandler Bing and have you doing by jury
now what if you want our user to submit
a review for that we're going to have to
create a form so outside the ng-repeat
div tag create a phone tag
the phone has a name is equal to review
form now we're going to be allowing the
user to specify a comment so we're going
to have a label tag let's say comment
and a break then we can have a text area
as an input then we can have an input
label to a label tag that specifies who
the author is create another break tag
we can specify an input so input type is
equal to text then close the tag let me
go ahead and save it reload it we have a
comment let's go ahead and add a break
tag here as well save it
reload it we have a comment and we have
an author so we can type in our comment
this is great
and we have an author Ross now we can
also have a live preview of what the
user is entering to do that within a
font tab within our font tag create a
paragraph tag and specify form Dodd
comment and the break tag next line
paragraph tag form dot author now we
have a comment we have an author how do
we bind the text area and the input form
control with an expression so to do that
we're going to be using a new directive
called
ng model so in a text area an NG model
director sorry
ng model and set it equal to form dot
comment and in our input control type ng
model is equal to form dot author go
ahead and save this and let's see what
happens refresh the browser when you
type a comment well this is great
there is an automatic binding happening
between a form control and our
expression so when the user types our
comment and enters an author name saying
Rose it automatically fills you the
comment and author now in the next video
let us see how to sub</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
