the eye screen where the user can
actually play the video so I'm going to
go back to visual studio and over here
in video details component just above
the form tag I'm going to add the iframe
now this iframe has a width of hundred
percent a height of 300 pixels and the
source we are going to use data binding
and then add or assign the video url so
video dot URL so let's build this and
check if this works so NJ build alright
now let's go back to the browser and
refresh this now I'm going to click on
angular with asp.net MVC alright so as
you see the iframe is not working as
expected we do have the iframe however
the videos cannot be played so if you
have a look at the problem let's open
the console so f12 and over here if we
check we can see the editor so error in
video detail component inline template
caused by unsafe value used in a
resource URL now I'm not going to go
into the details of this error but I
will show you the solution basically
this URL is not safe is what the angular
is instructing us so we need to convert
the URL into a safe URL and then assign
it to the iframe source and for that we
are going to make use of a pipe so open
command prompt again and first we are
going to generate a new fight so the
command is ng g4 generates piece for
pipe and then the main of this pipe is
going to be safe now what this does is
let's go back over here I'm going to
refresh this so the first thing it does
as an app module a module dot here it is
going to import the safe fight and then
also add it to the declarations array
and it is also going to create a file
safe dot type dot es with some code so
again I'm going to copy paste the code
for this
regular pipe so ctrl-c and ctrl-v and
there you go so what this pipe does is
it takes in a URL and then it returns a
safer version of the same URL right so
what we can do now is go back to our
video detail component and over here
after with your doc URL we are going to
use the pipe character and then save so
it is this safe pipe is going to accept
the video URL and then return a safer
version of the same URL so we can go
back over here and then build it again
and test it out in the browser all right
our build is now complete let's refresh
this now we're going to click on angular
you should now have the video and we can
play this particular video all right so
that is how you play a video in an
iframe using angular the next video let
us see how to insert a new video into
the database so thank you guys for
watching feel free to subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
