the native api's that can be involved in
electron and let's start off with menus
now there are two types of menus
application menu and context menu let's
learn about application menu in this
video and context menu in the next when
no menu is specified in the code
electron provides a default set of menus
for the browser window so if you have a
look we have file edit view window and
help but most of the times when you
create an application you want to create
your own menu for that application as
well so let's see how to create our own
menu for an electron application again
as before I am starting with the hello
world application in package.json I have
just changed the name to menu demo and
in mixed dot HTML have changed the title
as well as the h1 tag to menu demo now
the first thing we need to do is require
the menu sub module from electron so
Const
menu is equal to electron dot menu and
then all our code is going to be in AB
dot on ready so I'm gonna break this
down into a function and within the
function let's call create window and
then we are going to build our menu so
on the menu object that we just required
we can invoke the built from template
method that takes in a parameter now we
are going to call this parameter as
template and template is just a
combination of arrays and objects let's
take a look so I'm going to say Const
template is equal to an empty array for
now next we add the different menus for
our application as objects so let's
start with a single menu so specify a
pair of curly braces and within the
curly braces we specify key value pairs
and the first key is the label now this
will be the text that the user can view
and I'm going to name this as demo so
this is
basic template for our menu go ahead and
assign this to a constant seconds menu
is equal to menu dot built from template
and then now that we have this basic
menu to set this as our application menu
we are going to invoke menu dot set
application menu and then passin the
menu that we have just created
so now let's save this and run our
application and PM start you can see
that we don't have file edit and so on
instead we just have a demo menu that we
have created in our code next let's add
a drop-down of sub menus for this drop
menu so I'm going to close this and
within this object I'm going to specify
a comma and then specify sub menu now
this sub menu is going to be an array
again because each menu can have an
array of sub menus and within the sub
menu array we are going to again specify
objects it's going to be a label again
what the user can see I'm going to name
this as sub menu one and let's also
create another sub menu put a comma pair
of curly braces label sub menu to so now
if we save our application and run NPM
start you should see the demo menu when
I click on this you should see sub menu
one and sub menu 2 but if we click on
the sub menus nothing happens so let's
see how to listen to the click event on
one of these sub menus so I'm going to
close this again go back to our code and
to handle the click event for sub menu 1
I'm going to specify a comma and then
click now when this is clicked we're
going to have a function and within the
function I'm just going to log to the
console console dot log clicked sub menu
one so let's restart our application NPM
start
so now if you have a look at your if you
have a look at our terminal there is no
message we're gonna click on demo and
then submenu one and you can see that it
says click submenu one so this is how
you handle a click event on your sub
menu all right now if you wish to you
can even have separators between your
sub menus so between these two objects
I'm going to specify another set of
curly braces and then this time I'm
going to specify the key as tight and
then the value is separated
so now let's restart our application and
p.m. start and if I click on demo you
can see that there is a horizontal line
between submenu 1 and submenu two so you
can add separators in your menus to
group together sub menus that go
together so that's basically the
intention alright so that is how you
create a menu with sub menus and handle
click errands
alright let's create another menu and
for example a help menu that we usually
come across so we have our so we have
the first object so that represents one
menu put a comma and then another pair
of curly braces so this represents our
second menu over here I'm going to type
label and this is going to be health and
then we're going to assign it a click
event handler so click and we are going
to again call a function and within the
function what we are going to do is open
the link to electron now for that we
need to make use of electron dot shell
dot open external now we will be
covering shell module in electron in
later on in the course but for now this
is how you open a URL electron dot shell
open external and then you specify the
URL so it's going to be HTTP electron
dot atom
oh so now if I run NPM start again you
should see that we have our demo menu
and also the help menu and if I click on
the help menu it
it directly takes us to electron atom IO
in the browser alright finally what I
want to talk about is the predefined
menus that electron provides now most of
the applications you are going to build
will have some standard menus like edit
View window and so on
so what electron does is it provides
roles for each of the menus
functionality so let me show you an
example let's say we want to create an
edit menu that allows us to cut copy
paste undo and redo the standard
operations in any application well
here's how electron helps us build that
menu let me copy paste the code and then
explain so over here I'm going to assign
it as the very first menu and ctrl alt F
sorry I'll shift F to format it and just
like any other menu we have a label
which the user can see and this is edit
this edit menu has an array of sub menus
and instead of adding labels and click
handlers for each of these sub menus
electron provides predefined roles for
these menus and submenus so by
specifying a role you're asking electron
to handle the implementation so let's
run this and take a look at what is the
result
so NPM start so now you can see that we
have added and when I click on edit you
can see that there is undo redo cut copy
paste paste in match style delete select
all and for all of these there is
already a shortcut available that you
can use as well and let me demonstrate
for example if I click on select all it
is going to select everything in this
browser window
so these rolls have already been
implemented by electron so you can
directly use them in your application
now there are a lot more roles the
electron provides so I recommend you go
through the documentation to implement
the roles that are necessary for your
application but this is the gist of how
menus work in electron so first you
import the sub module and then you build
a template and once you build a template
you pass the template to the build temp
to the build from template method and
then assign that to your application
menu using set application menu method
alright that's pretty much about the
application level menu let's take a look
at context menu in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
