to learn about HTTP and observables in
angular currently in our application we
are serving the data that is hard-coded
into the employee service but in a
real-world application we need to fetch
this data from a web server so we need
to replace this hard-coded data with an
HTTP call to the server now before we
proceed with the code let us first
understand the mechanism of an HTTP call
and something known as an observable
that is returned by the HTTP call so we
have our application that runs on the
browser in our application we have the
two components Employee List and
employee detail both these components
make use of the employee service for
their data and right now the employee
service provides hard coded data to the
components but what we want is the data
to be fetched from the server and for
that we make an HTTP request the HTTP
GET request will hit a web api or a web
service which will fetch the data from a
database and send it back as an HTTP
response the response we get back from
the HTTP call is an observable now the
employee service needs to cast this
observable into an array of employees
and then return the same to the employee
list and employee detail components so
the HTTP mechanism is just two steps
first step send the HTTP request second
step receive in process the HTTP
response now the second step is where
things might seem a little complicated
so let us first understand what an
observable is and get a clearer picture
of the HTTP mechanism to help you
understand what an observable is and
have to work with them I'm going to use
a very simple example of a newspaper
company so we have an
paper company and this company has a
source of information the company makes
a request to the source to send it every
day news as a response to the company's
request the source sends in a sequence
of information throughout the day now
once the information is received the
first thing the newspaper company has to
do is convert the information into
newspaper format for example the source
might just send in a single line of
information but the newspaper company
has to map that information into a
headline a body for that headline and so
on once that is done the newspaper
company has the newspaper in the desired
format and is ready to be distributed to
the houses but hang on does the
newspaper company distribute papers to
every single house no it hands the
newspapers to only those houses that
have subscribed to this company so if a
new house subscribes to this company
that house will receive the newspaper as
well right now let's say the first two
houses have subscribed to this company
so only these two houses will receive
the newspaper and after this point what
the people want to do with the newspaper
is completely up to them the newspaper
company does not bother about it house
one might read the newspaper
whereas house two might make paper
planes out of them but the company's
responsibility is done so now that we
have understood this basic example let's
see how we can relate this to
observables in the application we are
working with the newspaper company is
like the employee service in our
application the source of information is
nothing but a database or of API or a
web service the employee service makes a
request to the database with the HTTP
GET call as a response we get back and
observable but what exactly is an
observable
take a look an observable is nothing but
a sequence of items that arrived
asynchronously over time but what you
have to make note of here is that with
an HTTP call it is a single item instead
of a sequence of items and that single
item is nothing but the HTTP response so
in the context of HTTP mechanism in
angular and observable is nothing but
the HTTP response that arrives
asynchronously back in our application
after we make a get request we receive
an HTTP response as an observable but
this is not a format that we can readily
use in our application so once we
receive the observable we need to
convert it into an employee array after
conversion the data is ready to be
provided to the components in our
application after we provide the data to
every single component in our
application no we only provide the data
to the components that have subscribed
to this employee service since we need
the data in the employee list component
and employee detail component we are
going to subscribe to this observable
from only these two components and after
this it is completely up to the
components to decide what to do with the
data the employee list component might
decide to display just the name of the
employee whereas the employee detail
component might decide to display the
complete information about the employees
well this is pretty much the best
analogy that I can give you to help you
understand the concept of observables
and don't worry this will make a lot
more sense when we write the code in the
next video so we can summarize the HTTP
mechanism in angular with the following
four steps the first step make an HTTP
GET request from the employee service
the second step will receive the
observable and cast it in
to an array of employees third step we
are going to subscribe to the observable
from employee list and employee detail
components finally we assign the array
of employees to a local variable in the
components which can be later used for
display in the view and as the last part
of this video a quick word on rxjs rxjs
is a library that enables us to work
with observables in angular applications
it is reactive extensions for Java
Script and is nowhere related to react
library from Facebook it is just an
external library to work with
observables alright now that we have a
good idea about observables and the HTTP
mechanism in general let's implement it
in our application so thank you guys for
watching feel free to subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
