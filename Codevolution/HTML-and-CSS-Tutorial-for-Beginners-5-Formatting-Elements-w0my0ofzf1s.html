five and in this video we are going to
be learning the reyes formatting
elements in HTML now the very first one
is the bold tag which is used to make
text bold so let's say we want this word
friends to be in bold so a bold tag is
specified using B so B and then after
the content which is friends we are
going to be closing the bold tag so a
front slash and B now when we save it
and reload it and you can see here that
friends is now bold and bolder than the
other words at least now the second one
is the italic italic tag but it's used
to italicize text so let's say we want
our heading to be italicized now we make
use of the eye tag followed by the
content then the closing I tag to make
any where italicized so say that and
then reload it and you see that friends
is now italicized now we also have a tag
to underline text and that is the you
tag now let's say we want to underline
six friends
so the you tag is used to underline
followed by the content and then the
closing you tag so off one slash and
then you so save it and when we refresh
it you can see here that six friends is
now underlined okay now we can also
strike through text so let's create a
new paragraph and let's say yeah let me
create a new paragraph and within the
paragraph let's say all ten seasons now
at let's say hundred dollars and
let me use the strikethrough
tag to strike and then close after the
hundred dollars with a strike and then
we can specify let's say ten dollars yep
don't you do it so let me go ahead save
it and refresh it and we can say all ten
seasons now what
nope not hundred dollars this is a
ceiling sale it's all available at ten
dollars that's how you use the
strikethrough and then we can also have
subscripts and superscripts let's say
that you're working on and a website
which has some algebra in it so let's
consider a paragraph tag and within the
paragraph let's say we want to specify
variable so X 1 X 2 X 3 and so on so we
have X and then now we have a subscript
so seob
is the tag and we specify the closing
tag SUV once again and then this time we
specify 1 now when you save it and
reload it it says X 1 now you see that X
1 is the subscript now if you copy it
and if we copy it and have another
paragraph and instead of subscript
change it to superscript and let's say
make it 2 and when we save it and reload
our webpage it says X square so that's
how you make use of subscripts and
superscripts if you want to know display
some mathematical content and finally we
also have a preserved tag that is used
to preserve any white spaces within the
document so let's say we have a
paragraph
and we make use of PR e which is the
preserved tag to preserve the white
space so leaving blank spaces and then
just leave spaces and then intentionally
so when we save it and reload it you see
that leaving blank spaces intentionally
so the white spaces are now preserved so
anyway therefore the formatting element
the bold using the B tag the italics
using the eye tag then underlining using
the you tag striking through text using
the strike tag that we have a subscript
and superscript tag then we also have
the preserve tag to preserve white
spaces within the document thank you
