mentioning in the previous video if your
focus right now is on learning the
features of es2015 and you want to hold
off on typescript then I have an
alternative setup so go to google and
type a scratch Jas and over here click
on the Chrome Web Store link now what a
scratch yes let me read out the
description because it is pretty clear
this extension is an add-on for dev
tools which integrates both the tracer
and babel transpilers allowing you to
test out the new JavaScript features
coming with Eggman script 6 also known
as es6 or es2015 so go ahead and add
this to Chrome I've already done that
and now to get started with scratches
hit the f12 key and over here in dev
tools navigate to scratch j/s ok once
you're here click on toggle output and
this is going to split our browser
screen on the left is where we type our
es2015 code and on the right is where it
is going to display the es5 code so es6
transpile - es pi and we quickly show
you an example so let a is equal to 5
and console dot log a now if you had a
look over here when I was typing it was
automatically showing the output for the
es 5 file as well so let as a feature in
es6 and that gets transpired to a bar
which is in es5 now to run this code
click on run let's go to our console and
if you see here we have output 5 so
console dot log 5 and output 5 so this
is the easiest way I could think of
where you can even execute as you are
learning from the video on the left es6
code on the right es5 code run then and
you have your output on the console so
this
stricted to es2015 features only you
cannot do this with typescript but hope
this helps you all thank you guys for
watching and I'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
