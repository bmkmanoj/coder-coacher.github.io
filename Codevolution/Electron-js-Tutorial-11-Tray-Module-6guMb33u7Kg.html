you how to create a tray icon for your
electron application I will show you a
basic tray icon with just a dummy menu
but once you understand the concept you
can implement a tray icon that suits
your application ok let's get started
again I'm starting off with the basic
hello world application in package.json
I've changed name to tray demo and index
dot HTML have changed the title and the
h1 tag now let's go to our main dot J's
and for this application we do not need
a browser window so I'm gonna remove the
code so we don't need this create window
function anymore and let me replace this
create window with just a regular
function and then I'm going to remove
this line of create window as well now
the first thing we need to do is import
the tray module from electron so Const
tray is equal to electron dot tray next
we need an icon that represents our
application in the system tray so Const
icon tap is equal to path dot join
underscore underscore directory name and
I have an icon in our project directory
which is YouTube logo dot jpg so if you
notice here I have this YouTube logo
image which I will be using as the tray
icon so in the current project folder
there is a file YouTube logo jpg and
then we just join this path using the
path module now when the app is ready I
can add this icon to the tray so it is
going to be new tray icon pad so let's
run this and test it out
so see the into your project folder and
then NPM start there is no browser
window but if you have a look at the
system tray we have our icon and nothing
really happens when you click on this
icon so let's quickly add a context menu
let's say you're creating a
screen-recording desktop application and
you want to specify the audio levels and
the resolution so here's how we are
going to create that context menu first
we require menu from electron so Const
menu is equal to electron dot menu and
then we will create a template so I will
copy paste the code and then explain
what the menu is
so with an AB dot on ready I'm going to
paste the template and this template has
two menus an audio menu and a video menu
now this audio menu has two sub menus
low and high and they're off type radio
buttons and by default the low sub menu
is checked
similarly in me do we have 1280 by 720
and 1920 by 1080 so two sub menus and by
default 1280 by 720 is checked okay now
that we have a template we can create
our context menu
so const context menu if equal to menu
dot build from template and we pass in
the template and then we can assign this
menu to our application in the tray so
initially let's say let tray is equal to
null and then tray is equal to new tray
and then at the end tray dot set context
menu context menu so now if i restart
the application sub control C and then
NPM start we should again have our
application in the system tray and when
I right-click on this I have audio and
video so in audio you can see that we
have low and high two radio buttons and
low is checked by default
similarly in video we have 1280 by 720
and 1920 by 1080 and by default this is
checked so I can click on high and if I
go back high is selected and I can
select 1920 by 1080 and if I go back
that is select
so that is how you set a context menu
for your application in the tray and
finally what you might want to do is set
a tooltip for your tray icon so that the
user knows what that particular icon is
so right now if I hover over this icon I
get nothing so I have no clue what this
application is so in our app dot on
ready we can say tray dot set tooltip
and then we can pass in a title I'm just
going to name this as tray application
so let's restart our application control
C NPM start and if I go to the system
tray when I hover over this you can see
that it mentions tray application so
this is the basic concept behind tray
icons you first require tray from
electron and then you build a menu for
that particular tray and then you assign
that menu as a context menu to that
particular tray and then you can also
set a tooltip so that the user knows
what that icon represents well thank you
