essential that your model and the view
are always in sync otherwise the data
might not be consistent for example
consider a login form this has a
username and password and the component
class has the corresponding properties
username and password whenever a user
updates these input controls your model
or properties should automatically
receive those values and when there is
an update in the model or property value
your view should automatically reflect
the updated values now we have learned
about property binding and event binding
and we are in a good position to write
our own code for this but angular wants
to help us out and provides us with a
cool feature which is two-way binding
two-way binding allows us to update a
property and at the same time display
the value of that property and for
two-way binding angular provides another
directive namely the ng model directive
let's take a look at an example so that
things are more clear let's go back to
visual studio code and first I'm going
to create a new property in the class
this is going to be public main and
initially an empty string now in the
template I'm going to add a new input
element input type is equal to text and
then right next to the input element I'm
going to bind this property value using
interpolation so what we want here is
that when I type something in the input
box
I want the property to be updated with
this value and as soon as the property
gets updated with that value I want it
to be shown here with interpolation
basically our view and the model should
always be in sync that is what we are
going for so for that like I mentioned
we need to use the ng model directive so
within the input element add the
directive ng model
and then surround it first with
parentheses and then with square
brackets parenthesis and square brackets
now if this is hard to remember think of
a banana in a box so we have a banana
inside a box at least that's what the
angular team suggests all right to this
ngmodel directive we need to assign the
property which is the main property so
within quotes name so this should seem
familiar to you we have the square
brackets for property binding which is
data flow from the clasp to the template
and we have parentheses for event
binding so the data flow from the
template to the class there is to a data
flow and hence two-way binding now if we
save this and head over to the browser
you can see that there is a problem in
the console you can see can't bind to ng
model since it isn't unknown property of
input so angular is not aware of the ng
model directive because it is in a
separate module called the forms module
so let's add that module to our
application so open app dot module dot
TS file and import the forms module and
then add it to the imports array so next
to browser module and a comma and then
forms module so now if we save this and
head over to the browser we can see that
we have the input box and it is empty
and if I start typing something for
example code evolution you can see that
the same text being written out right
next to it
this is two-way binding from the input
the value flows to the class property
and from the class property the value
flows back to the template this will
ensure our view and the property values
are always consistent now we will make
use of two-way binding when we learn
about forms later on but for now that's
pretty much it thank you guys for
watching don't forget to subscribe and
as
you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
