angular application is made up of
several components each representing its
own mu and in the previous video we
learned about the app component which is
responsible for displaying the hello
world in our browser now
in this video let us create a new
component from scratch and learn how to
use that component in our application
now the first thing we have to do is
create a new typescript file and let us
make this component about our tutorials
so within our app folder create a file
called tutorials
component component dot TS now just like
our app component we first have to
import the component class from the core
module so angular I forgot the @ symbol
so angular core next thing we need to
specify is the com1 end ok oops sorry
about that ok so if you remember a
component is nothing but a class with
some metadata so let's name our class as
tutorials component and since we need to
use this class in other components we
are going to have to export it so we
have our component class and now we
attach the component decorator with a
case however that we attach the
component decorator for our class so
within our component decorator we are
going to specify a selector and a
template so selector which is going to
be the custom HTML tag that we are going
to use to represent this component so
let's have it as my tutorials and a
template which is going to have the HTML
code so let's just have within
- its - tag we can specify let's say
joke Mon tutorials right so we have our
import segment a component decorator and
associated class so that means our newly
created component is complete now if you
remember I mentioned that usually in
angular applications we will have one
main component called the root component
and other components are usually part of
this root component so in our case the
root component is the app component and
the tutorials component is going to have
to live inside this app confident so
let's see how to do that first replace
these single inverted commas with
backticks now the backtick is nothing
but the key right below escape and above
the tab key and this is going to allow
us to specify HTML in multiple lines now
what is the HTML we need to specify it
is the selector of our tutorials
component so my slash tutorials and then
a closing tag my slash tutorials
now just like our index.html where we
have my app for the app component we
have used the my tutorials for the
tutorials component now what we should
expect is that from our tutorials
component we should have the Jomon
tutorials template replacing the
selector tag over here which in turn is
going to get replaced in our index dot
HTML so if we have a look at our browser
we see that the job on tutorials text is
missing why that is because our app
component doesn't know or doesn't
understand what this my tutorials tag
so we need a way to inform our ad
component about this my tutorials
component or the tutorials component
that we do by using another
configuration called directives so
directives is going to have an array we
are going to specify an array for now it
is just the name of the component so the
tutorials component now if I hover my
mouse it says cannot find name tutorials
component that is because this file
right here is not unaware is unaware of
the tutorials component so we need to
import the tutorials component so to do
tutorials component from our tutorials
component file so from now since we are
since the file is within the same folder
we are going to have a dot and a forward
slash specified I mean followed by the
tutorials dot component file name we are
not going to specify the extension as I
already mentioned now if we save is
going to automatically compile and then
there you go
shoutmon tutorials and here if you are
going to let's say inspect
alright let me bring it over here so
this how it is within our body tag we
have the my apt tag which is our root
component within the root component we
have hello world from Jodoin which is
the template and my app widget within
app component and then we have another
tag which is my tutorials tag and that
is going to be joke bone tutorials so
that is how we create a new component
and then use it in another component
using directives and we're going to be
learning more about these directives and
the future videos but for now this is
how you create a confident and then use
it in your route component so thank you
guys for watching don't forget subscribe
hope you guys are enjoying the video and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
