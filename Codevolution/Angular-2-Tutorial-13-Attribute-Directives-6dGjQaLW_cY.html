we are going to be learning about
attribute directives so an attribute
directive
changes the behavior of the Dom element
and we are going to be learning about ng
class and ng style built-in directives
in this video so if we so ng class is
actually used to dynamically apply
multiple classes to an HTML element so
let's understand with an example how ng
class works so let's first create two
new classes that we want to apply to our
HTML element so backticks within the
back ticks let's create a class plus one
which says color is white let's create
another class plus two which says
background color is going to be black
now here inside our tutorials component
let's create two new properties c1 is
equal to true public c2 is equal to true
now these are the properties that we are
going to be using to assign these
classes class one and class two to our
HTML element so over here within our
template create a new paragraph
so paragraph close paragraph and ng
class paragraph okay this should be in G
and to use the ng class directive
remember directive is going to live
within the paragraph tag so square
bracket and within the square bracket ng
class now this ng class is going to have
a right-hand side which is going to
contain the list of classes that we want
to apply based on the truth or false
value of these two properties so class
one is going to be based on C one and
class two
based on
- so what we are doing here is to this
HTML tag you're using the ng class
directive which is going to list the
classes that we want to apply so class
one and class two of the classes based
on the value of c1 and c2 which are the
properties defined in tutorials
component class so right now both are
true so if we go back to your browser we
must have this ng class paragraph with
white font color and a black background
color now we can go to the next extent
and create a button that says toggle and
close the button tag now let's assign or
let us create event binding we are going
to have the click event and when there
is a click let's create a method called
toggle and over here let's define that
method toggle and this title is just
going to negate the values of C 1 and C
2 so this dot C 1 is equal to not of
this dot C 1 and this dot C 2 is equal
to not of this dot C 2 and when you save
this and go back to the browser we are
going to have a button which is going to
toggle the values from true to false and
there you go the classes that were being
applied over here based on C 1 and C 2
it is now false and these two classes
have not applied to this paragraph tag
now if I click again the value becomes
true and the classes are added so that
is how ng class works now if it's not a
class but just an inline style we want
to use that we can use the ng style
attribute directive so let's create two
new properties so public let's say style
is equal to italic
Vitalik
public size is equal to let's say 30
pixels now over here we can create
another dot another paragraph tag so
paragraph paragraph this is ng style
paragraph and again just like ng class
it is going to live inside the paragraph
tag within square brackets we are going
to have ng style and on the right hand
side we are going to have the list of
styles that we want to apply based on
these property values so we have a font
file our font style so font style which
is going to have the value of style
property and we are going to have font
size which is going to have the size
property value so when this is executed
this paragraph is going to have a font
style of italic and font size of 30
pixels and okay let me just quickly
check if okay I've forgotten to use the
double quote
okay now when I reload the browser it is
going to have ng style paragraph in
italics and a font size of 30 now again
you can have a button that can assign
values to your style and size properties
just like in G class but you get the
height you get the idea so that's pretty
much it about the built-in attribute
directives now you can create custom
structural directives and attribute
directives but I'm going to hold it off
till the end of the video series maybe
towards some somewhere towards the end
but for now that's pretty much it about
attribute directives so thank you guys
for watching don't forget subscribe and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
