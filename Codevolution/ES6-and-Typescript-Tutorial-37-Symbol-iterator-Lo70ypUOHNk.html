number 37 and in this video we are going
to be learning about a built-in symbol
called symbol dot iterator now there are
there are a couple of built-in symbols
other than the symbol dot iterator and I
recommend you to go through the
documentation to learn more about them
and in the documentation they will be
termed as well-known symbols so in this
video let us understand the use of the
built-in symbol symbol dot iterator
which is essential moving forward so if
you recall a concept from one of the
earlier videos we learned that es2015
provides a new way to iterate over
objects and that was the for off loop
but the fall of loop can be used with
all types of objects for an object to
work with the for off loop it needs to
have a special method and the special
method is called as the iterator method
so iterator method and how do we know if
the object has an iterator method by
checking to see if the object has a
method defined for the key symbol dot
iterator so this is where this
well-known symbol symbol dot iterator
comes into action
so let's look let's look at an example
to get a clearer understanding of what I
just explained so I'm going to comment
this out okay so now I'm going to create
a string let STR equals hello I'm also
going to create an array 1 comma 2 comma
3 let's also create a number so let num
equals 5 and then let's also create an
object there's just going to have name
Chandler now what I'm going to do is log
to the console let's let's have for
string and over here I'm going to check
type of SDR which is the object here SDR
and then symbol dot iterator change this
back again symbol dot iterator
and I'm good I'm going to copy this for
the other objects as well and I'm going
to explain what they mean in just a bit
so for a string for array for a number
and for object and STR is going to be
array this is going to be num and then
obj so what we are doing here is
checking to see if a method exists for
the object at this particular key so at
symbol dot iterator if typeof string of
symbols iterator returns a method or a
function then this object can be used
with the for off loop so now let's have
a look which of these types can be used
with the for off loop so for string it's
a function that means we can use a
string in a for loop for array we can
use a for loop because the type of the
method is function or the type of method
add similar iterator is a function but
for number and object it is undefined so
that means to say that we cannot use the
for off loop with number and object now
that is the main use of symbol dot
iterator to check a for off loop can be
used with a particular object or not now
does that mean that objects are not
iterable well no we can write our own
special iterator method this right here
so that even an object can be used with
the for of loop and that is what we are
going to be learning about in the coming
videos so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and else
you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
