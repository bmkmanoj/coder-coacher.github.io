five now I not only want to explain to
you the new features of es 2015 but also
want to explain to you why they were
required in the first place what were
some of the challenges in es5 that led
to the introduction of these new
features in es6
so before we start off with our very
first es 2015 keyword which is the left
keyword we need to have an understanding
of hoisting and functional scope of the
war declaration in JavaScript so what
I've done is created a new typescript 5
tutorial 5 TS and when I build it it's
going to generate this tutorial 5 GS
which I have referenced here in our
index dot HTML and within tutorial 5 dot
T s I have a very simple function so
function greet person which is going to
accept name as a parameter and if name
is Chandler then we have a war
declaration assigning hello Chandler to
the greet variable if the name is not
Chandler then we have a war declaration
assigning hi there to the great variable
then outside the felts block we have
console dot log greet variable then
finally we call greet person with
Chandler passing as the parameter now
when you build this browser is going to
refresh and we are going to get our
output hello Chandler and if I change
this to change this to Chandal it
displays hi there
so our function is working now what you
might be wondering is that we have two
declarations of the greet variable if
the name is Chandler then we have a
declaration greet is equal to hello
Chandler and if the name is not Chandler
we have another word a declaration
assigning hi there to the grid variable
now this might seem confusing if you are
from let's say a c-sharp or a Java
background but in JavaScript this is
completely fine because of something
known as hoisting now behind the scenes
or behind the curtains JavaScript is
rewritten to have a single declaration
of the variable at the top ignoring any
duplicate declarations so this
declaration War greed and war greed is
going to be rewritten as water greet
over here and this is going to be
replaced with just greet now let's save
this let's see if our yep it's still
working fine hello Chandler so this is
how Java Script is going to be rewritten
now to prove to you that hoisting does
exist let me cut this and place it below
console dot log where we are using the
Greek variable now if i refresh it is
still hello Chandler so this is known as
hoisting in JavaScript where any wire
declaration is going to be moved to the
very top of the function so keep that in
mind now the other thing that I wanted
to discuss is the functional scope of
the work keyword so I'm going to undo
the changes
okay one more yep okay so even though
war is declared inside the if block over
here we are still able to access the
value outside the if block over here in
our console log log so a war declaration
has a functional scope it doesn't matter
if you are declaring it within an if
block on else block or for loop or a
while loop the value is going to be
accessible within the function so
functional scope keep that in mind as
well now because of hoisting and
functional scope more declaration seems
a bit tricky which is why es2015
introduced the let keyword which we are
going to be learning about in the next
video so thank you guys for watching
don't forget to subscribe and stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
