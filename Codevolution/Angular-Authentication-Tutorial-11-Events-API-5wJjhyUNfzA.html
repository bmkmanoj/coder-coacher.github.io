create the api's to fetch regular and
special events instead of interacting
with MongoDB to fetch the events I'm
going to hard-code an array of events in
the API method itself and here's my
thought process behind that we are
focusing on authenticating angular
applications so I don't want to
complicate the application by adding a
new collection in MongoDB adding a new
model and then working with Mongoose
again I want to keep it as simple as
possible without affecting how things
were from a user point of view so the
API is to fetch events will just be
returning an array of hard-coded events
let's start with the API for returning
regular events so we are going to
continue in API chess it's going to be
router dot get this is a get method and
then the endpoint is slash events the
callback pass request and response and
in the callback function we have a
hard-coded list of events so let me
quickly copy/paste the array and you can
see that it's just an array of objects
each object represents an event an event
has an ID name description and date and
we just return this array as the
response so rest dot JSON events
similarly let's create a special events
API I'm going to copy/paste the events
API code and replace slash events with
slash special so let me copy this
paste it and then change events to
special and that's in the API is to
return regular and special events are
ready and since these are get requests
we can test them right in the browser
and there is no need of postman so save
the file and restart the server so ctrl
C and then node server head to the
browser and navigate to localhost 3000
slash API slash events you should see
the array of events similarly if I
change slash events to slash special you
can see that we still have the array of
events so both the event API s are
working as expected with this we
complete nearly 80% of our back-end code
the remaining 20% we will code
hand-in-hand with our angular
application when we deal with
authentication so from the next video
let's concentrate on setting up our
front-end with angular thank you guys
