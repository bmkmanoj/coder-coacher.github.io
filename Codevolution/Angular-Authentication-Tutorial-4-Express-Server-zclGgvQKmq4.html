writing some code let's begin by
creating the Express server I have a
folder called angular auth which is
going to contain our entire application
so all the code we write goes within the
single folder I'm going to create a new
folder called server which contains the
back-end code and within the server
folder I'm going to initialize a new
package dot JSON file so open the
integrated terminal navigate inside the
server folder and run the command NPM in
it - - yes you should now have the
package dot JSON file next let's install
the dependencies so again in the
terminal run the command NPM install
Express body parser - - save Express is
our webserver and body parser is the
middle way to handle form data such as
user registration or login now that the
dependencies are installed in the server
folder create a new file called server
dot J's within this file we begin by
requiring the packages that we have just
installed Const Express is equal to
require Express and Const body parser is
equal to require body parser next let's
create a constant for the port number
that our Express server will run on
Const port is equal to 3000 now we
create an instance of express we also
specify the body parser to handle JSON
data AB dot use volley parser dot JSON
next let's add some code to test a get
request AB get a forward slash as the
first argument
and a callback function as the second
one the callback function has request
and response and within the function we
are just going to response dot send
hello from server finally we listen to
requests on the specified port app dot
listen on the port number that we have
specified and then again a callback
function you're just going to log to the
console server running on localhost and
append the port number so our basic
Express server is now ready let's start
it up in the terminal make sure you're
in the server folder and run the command
node server you should see the message
server running on localhost port 3000
which implies the Express server is up
and ready for requests we can go to the
browser and make a request to localhost
3000 and we should see the message hello
from server the output corresponding to
this get request now as a good practice
though it is better to have a separate
route for all the API requests so within
the server folder create a new folder
and name it routes within the routes
folder create a new file and call it API
dot J's here is where we define all our
API endpoints let's add a simple get
request code we begin by importing
Express and router so Const Express is
equal to require Express Const router is
equal to Express dot router next we are
going to handle the get request so roger
get a forward slash then we are going to
have a callback function and I'm going
to start
using es6 syntax so we're going to have
a phat error function with request and
response and within the function again
we are going to just say response dot
send from API route and finally we
export the router module dot experts is
equal to router now we need to tell our
server to use this route so go back to
server yes and over here I'm going to
specify Const API is equal to require
dot slash routes slash API and after the
body parser I'm going to type app dot
use slash API and the second argument is
API so now when we make a request to
localhost colon 3000 slash API the
server knows it has to use the API route
and what is the API route it is the API
dot JS file within the routes folder so
when you enter the URL localhost colon
3000 slash API this get request is
executed and the response will be from
API route let's test this out I'm going
to restart the node server so in the
terminal control C and then node server
go back to the browser and change the
URL to localhost colon 3000 slash API
and there you go from API route all
right so our basic Express server is up
and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
