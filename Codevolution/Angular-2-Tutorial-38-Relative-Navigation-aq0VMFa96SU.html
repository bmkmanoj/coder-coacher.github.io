learn about relative navigation now so
far in our application we have navigated
to different components using only
absolute pads and how do we recognize
absolute pads the begin with a forward
slash so if you have a look at
Department list component we have slash
departments and then the ID to navigate
to Department detail component and in
department detail component we have
slash departments to navigate back to
department list component now there is
one small disadvantage when we use
absolute pads and that is the lack of
flexibility while navigating so let me
give you an example so somewhere down
the road you realize that you need the
pad Department for some other component
so you go ahead and make a small change
to this pad and make it departments list
so let's also change this to departments
list and now you can go ahead and test
your application when you go to slash
departments list it's going to work fine
it is going to show you the department
list component but now when you click on
the department you see that the
application is broken and this is
because when we change a parent
component or the main pad the parent pad
or the main pad I mean to say we need to
change all occurrences of the absolute
pads corresponding to that particular
changed pad so we're here I would have
to change this to departments list and
again in the apartment detail component
over here I need to change this to
departments list
department list departments list so as
you see our application isn't really
that flexible now to make it flexible
we can make use of relative pathing and
here's the syntax let's start with
department list component I'm going to
comment the path for absolute path
or decode for absolute padding and then
I'm going to say this dot router dot
navigate just like before and then over
here I'm just going to pass in the
department ID and then I'm going to
specify relative to this dot route now
basically we are saying that navigate
with respect due to the current route
and similarly over here in department
detail component I'm going to comment
this and I'm going to say this dot
router dot navigate and over here we're
going to say dot dot slash and this
basically means move one path upwards
and then of course we are going to have
to specify the optional parameter that
is nothing but ID which is equal to
selected ID and then we're going to
specify relative to this dot route so
what is changing is how we construct the
URL now for example if we are viewing
the department list component that
implies that our current URL is
localhost 3000 slash departments list so
all we have to do is append this ID to
the current URL or for the current route
append this department ID and similarly
in department detail component all I
have to do is move back one segment in
the URL since I come from department
list slash ID if I remove this ID this
one or just move back one step I'm going
to end up with department list component
so now when we save our application and
something went wrong let me just reload
this so I'm in departments so I need to
change this to depart
departments list so that gives me the
list of departments when I click on
angular I navigate to departments list
slash one so so far all right let me go
back or let me change this to
departments list so this is the existing
URL if I just append the ID so slash one
I'm going to navigate to the department
detail component so to the existing URL
or this dot route I add the ID and when
I go back I just need to move back one
step so if I just remove this part of
the segment in the URL I go back to
department list and hence this
department list component is going to be
displayed so now again further down the
road if you want to change this back to
departments so let's say departments and
then department so you had a change of
heart you save this you go back to your
application you navigate to low closed
3000 it works fine you click on angular
it works fine you go back it works fine
you make this path as random you make
this also as random let's save this
let's change from all right let me wait
for it to reload change this to random
it's going to show me the department
list I click on angular it goes to the
detail when I come back it gives me the
list so now any change you make to the
main path your application still remains
intact your application is not broken so
there you go our application is much
more flexible now while navigating thank
you guys for watching like comment and
subscribe I'll see you guys in the next
