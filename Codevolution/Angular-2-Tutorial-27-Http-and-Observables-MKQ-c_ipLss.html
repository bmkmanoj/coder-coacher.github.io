number 27 and in this video we are going
to learn about HTTP and a few terms like
rxjs and observables that are new in
angular 2 so right now we are serving
the data that is hard-coded into the
service but in a real world scenario we
need to fetch this data from a web
server so we need to replace this
hard-coded data with an HTTP call to the
server but before we proceed with the
code let us first understand the
mechanism of an HTTP call and something
known as an observable that is returned
by the HTTP call so we have our
application that runs on the browser and
in our application we have the two
components employee list and employee
details both these components make use
of the employee service for their data
and right now the employee service
provides hard coded data to the
components but what we want is the data
to be fetched from a server and for that
we are going to be making use of HTTP
service that angular provides so inside
our employee service we are going to
invoke the get method of HTTP and in
turn the HTTP service will send a
request to the server now the request is
going to hit a web service or a web web
api which will fetch that which will
fetch the data from a database and send
it back as an HTTP response and the
response we get from the HTTP service is
called an observable now the employee
service needs to process this data that
comes as an observable and provide it to
the two components so the HTTP mechanism
we just have two steps send the HTTP
request receive and process the HTTP
response and this second step here is
where the complexity lies so let's focus
on learning what this observable is and
get a clearer picture of the HTTP
mechanism now to help you understand
what
and observable is and how to work with
them in angular I'm going to use a very
simple example of a newspaper company so
we have a newspaper company and the
company has a source of information now
the company makes a request to this
source to send in everyday news and as a
response to this company's request the
source sends in a sequence of
information throughout the day to this
particular company now once this
information is received the first thing
that this newspaper company has to do is
convert that information into the
newspaper format now the source might
just send in a single line of
information but this newspaper company
has to map that information into a
headline and then the body for that
headline and so on so now the newspaper
company has the newspaper in the desired
format and is ready to be distributed to
all the houses but wait a minute does
the company go around distributing to
every single house no it hands out the
newspapers to only those houses that
have subscribed to this company so if a
new house subscribes to the company then
that house receives the newspaper as
well
so right now house 1 and house do have
subscribed to this newspaper company and
only these two houses receive this
newspaper and after this point what the
people want to do with the paper is
completely up to them
the company is nowhere concerned now in
this house the people might want to read
the paper
but in this house the people might want
to make paper planes out of it but the
company's responsibility is done so now
that we have understood this basic
example let's see how we can relate this
to observables and application we have
at hand now this newspaper company is
like the employee service in our
application the source of information is
nothing but the database now the
employee service makes a request to the
database using the HTTP GET call and in
return we get an observable of type
response but what exactly is an
observable let's have a look at that an
observable is nothing but a sequence of
items that arrive asynchronously over
time but one thing to keep in mind is
that with HTTP calls it is always a
single item and that single item is
nothing but the HTTP response so the
observable we receive here is just a
single item which is nothing but the
HTTP response so in our application the
observable is not a sequence of items
but it is just a single item the HTTP
response object so we have made a
request and got the response but the
response is an observable observable
which is not the desired format for our
application so we are going to map this
observable into JSON format so we are
going to use a map operator on this
observable and get JSON data now the
employee data is in the JSON format and
that is ready to be provided to these
different houses and the houses are
nothing but the components in our
application so employee lists and
employee detail wait but do we provide
the data to all the components in our
application again no we provide it to
the components that subscribe to this
observable and since we need the data in
the employee list and employee detail we
are going to subscribe to the observable
from only these two components and after
this point it is completely up to the
component to decide what to do with the
data the employee list can display just
the employee name and the employee
detail component can display all the
details of the employee
so to summarize the HTTP mechanism we
have the following steps the first step
is that we make an HTTP GET call from
the employee service the second step we
receive the observable and map it to
JSON format the third step we subscribe
to the observable from the
components that require this data and
the fourth step we are going to assign
that receive the data to a local
variable in the view so that we can
display it to the user and finally this
term rxjs now observables are not a
current feature with angular or
typescript it is a proposed feature in
one of the future in es 2016 or it might
be 2017 but right now to make use of
observables and the different operations
on observables we need to use something
known as rxjs and that is reactive
extensions for javascript and this is an
external library that we use to work
with observables and this is not the
react from Facebook that's a completely
different thing this is just an external
library to work with observables so now
that we have understood the
functionality of how observables work
and how HTTP works in general let's
translate this into the code in our
application so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and I'll
see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
