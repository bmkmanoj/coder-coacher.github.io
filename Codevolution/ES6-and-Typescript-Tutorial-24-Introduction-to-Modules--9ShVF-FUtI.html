start learning about modules in es 2015
so first let us understand water modules
and why are they required now if you're
good through any book you'll notice that
the author divides the book into
chapters and sections why because this
makes it possible for a reader to
understand the progression in the book
and to easily find a specific part that
they're interested in also the author is
able to clearly indicate what the focus
is on now just like how a book is
divided into chapters modules divide a
program into sections of code that by
some criteria belong together now the
benefit of organizing a program into
module is that it helps people who
aren't yet familiar with the code to
find what they're looking for and by
keeping related pieces of code together
we also have separation of concern now
although javascript does have modules
they are implemented through libraries
and they're not built into the language
but now in es2015
the module syntax has been standardized
so let's say we have two files module
ATS and module B dot es then each of
these files become a module so if we
have a function in module B to use it in
module a we export from model B and
import in module a and that's the basic
idea behind modules export and import
now there are several ways to export and
import variables and functions so let's
have a look at that in detail in the
coming videos so thank you guys for
watching don't forget subscribe and stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
