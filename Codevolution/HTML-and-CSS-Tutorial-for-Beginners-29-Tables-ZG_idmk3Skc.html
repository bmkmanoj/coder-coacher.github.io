29 and in this video let us learn how to
style tables now let us first create
basic table so within our body tags
create a table element and we can have
rows in the table so we're going to be
using the TR tag for that and the first
row usually contains the table headings
so th and let's say column one column 1
and create another heading column 2 now
we are also going to have a second row
which contains some data so TD table
data this is let's say data one all
right and another TD and data to now
when we save this and refresh our
browser then we have column one column
two data one data too now the first
thing we can specify as a style is a
border for our table so that it is
visually more you know convincing as a
table so we can have style and within
the style we can create for the table ok
I need to use it as a selector it's a
table and we can have a border which is
two pixels and let the style be solid
with the color black when we save it and
refresh and we have a border that
appears around the table now this is
something we had already seen earlier
during our HTML videos but here's the
thing we can also individually apply
styles to the robe as well as the
heading and the data so create a new
selector so TR and let's give it a
background color so background color and
let's say orange save it when you
refresh it so you get a nice orange
color border
sorry a background color for each one of
the rows and you see a white color
separation between each of the cells now
it's also possible to apply like I said
a style for the th tag so let's go with
background color once again or our let's
let's go ahead what shall we go with
what shall we go with let's go with the
color to color let's do white let's save
it and when you refresh it you see that
the heading is in white color and
similarly we can specify TD so let's
give it a border and we can have one
pixel solid green you save it and reload
it so you see that each element ok let
me make it 5 pixels so that it's clearly
evident save it and refresh it so there
is a border of 5 pixels around the data
TD TD tags so here's one thing to keep
in mind though the TD tag doesn't
actually over overwrite the style of the
TI tag even though the TR tag is even
though the TD tag is included inside the
TR tag it is just an addition to the
already existing property so if there is
a property to the TR tag then the TV tag
is going to inherit that property and if
there is any additional property
specified for the DD tag then it is
going to add that property in addition
to what the property that TR tag already
had so that is why you see that a green
color still remains even though the TD
tag doesn't have a background color that
here tag does have a background color
and hence the TD tag also has a
background of orange color so that's
pretty much it about table
