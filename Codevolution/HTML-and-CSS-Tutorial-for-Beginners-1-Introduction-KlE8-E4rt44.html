series on HTML and CSS
my name is vishwas and in this and in
the first half of this video series we
are going to be learning about HTML and
in the second half of this video series
we are going to be learning about CSS
now if this is your very first tutorial
series on HTML then HTML stands for
hypertext markup language and it is the
most widely used language to create web
pages so if you guys ever want to create
your own website or even better become a
web developer then this tutorial series
is a great place to start alright then
let's begin with an analogy know I'm I'm
no biologist but we all know that the
human body consists of a skeletal system
and the skeletal system defines the
structure of our body so the head goes
on the top and then we have the body and
at the bottom we have the feet now on
top of our skeletal system we have the
muscles a layer of skin and hair and etc
and this defines the visual style of the
human body
similarly HTML defines the structure of
our web pages and CSS defines the visual
style of our web pages so together if
you combine HTML and CSS you can create
awesome websites now before we create
our very first website let me explain
this to you so we have our scale a
skeletal system and we know that the
scale skeletal system is made up of 206
bones so if you learn about each bone
one by one and then you put together
what you have learned then you basically
end up knowing the entire schedule a
skeletal system now in the same way HTML
is made up of something called as a tag
and there are more than 100 of them and
by learning each one of these tags and
then putting them together you end up
knowing HTML as a whole it's as simple
as that
now before we start creating our website
what we need is a text editor now you
can make use of notepad but I highly
recommend using something like notepad
plus plus or sublime text which is which
has syntax highlighting and it's more
advanced so I'm gonna be using sublime
text for this tutorial series but feel
free to use a text editor of your choice
so go ahead and download either notepad
plus plus or sublime text or any other
text editor you're comfortable with and
in the next video we are going to shift
gears and then dive right into learning
some tags and then building a very first
webpage thank you guys for watching and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
