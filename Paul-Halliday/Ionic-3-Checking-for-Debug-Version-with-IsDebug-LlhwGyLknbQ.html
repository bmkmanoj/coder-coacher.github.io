whether the application is running in a
debug mode or not let's start off by
installing the Cordova plugin named
Cordova plug-in is debug
to install the ionic native wrapper for
this plugin by seeing npm install' ionic
native slash is debug this plugin is
supported at the moment on Android and
iOS only so do take that into account if
you're looking at using it on devices
other than iOS or Android and with that
said let's open up inside of our editor
we can of course start by going to add
module TS and we can import is the bug
from ionic native slash is debug and
after that we can go down to our
providers list and add it to the list of
providers as we always do with an ionic
native plugin
after that we can hand over to the
components or page in which you want to
use this and we can make a function
named is debug or you could simply add
this to the constructor or an
initialization function and as this
returns a promise we will add async is
the bug
we'll console the errors and we will add
a try-catch that logs out for any error
and inside of here and inside of our try
block we need to first off inject is
debug inside of our constructor and
remember is debug does come from ionic
native so make sure you import that and
as we've called this variable here is
debug I will rename our function for
check debug and therefore we can say
Const is debug and that's going to be a
boolean true or false and therefore
inside of our try we can say constant
result is equal to and this result will
be either a boolean true or false this
dot s debug dot get is debug
for log this out to the console
should determine whether our application
is either in development modes for
example we're deploying it from the
ionic CLI Xcode or Android studio or
whether we're downloading it from the
store and it's been appropriately signed
so in order to call this function
I'm going to change the navbar title to
is debug an add a small more of color
and ear button the click event will
debug function with the text of check
debug let's now run this on our device
with ionic Cordova run Android - L like
I said you can substitute out for iOS if
you want and this will go ahead and at
the Cordova platform for Android
and run it and install it on the device
so here we are it has appeared on the
device and we can of course now check to
see whether we're in debug mode so I'm
going to click check debug and of course
we find although we have missed the
waves from our promise so let's go back
and do that again we need to do is
simply add a wave right here because we
want to resolve that promise and logout
not the promise itself but instead the
result so make sure you add a width
before get is debug and of course if we
check it once more and we click check
debug we can of course find out yep we
do get the results of true and we are of
course in debug mode if we were to
deploy this to the App Store
and were to check again and download
this as a production signed version then
we would not be in debug mode and this
would be false
so we use is the bunker inside of our
ionic applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
