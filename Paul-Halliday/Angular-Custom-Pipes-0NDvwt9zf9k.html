pipes inside of angular let's create our
own pipe inside of our app so underneath
the app directory I'm going to create a
new folder called sheds inside of here
I'll also create a new folder called
pipes then inside of the shared folder
I'll create a shared module don TS this
allows us to create some dependencies
that we can use throughout our project
it's a good idea to put these things as
part of a shared module so that we only
import at once and it allows for a much
more scalable app so let's start off by
making a new NG module if you remember
how to do that its imports from angular
core and we of course want the ng module
decorator let's create a new ng module
and for now we'll also export the class
named shared module we'll leave
everything blank for now and we'll come
back to this module in a moment inside
of the pipes directory I'm going to make
a new file called reverse pipe TS and in
case you haven't guessed already that's
going to reverse a string so let's
import from angular core once again both
pipe and pipe transform will export a
new class and that class will be called
reverse string and that will implement
the pipe transform interface let's also
add the pipe decorator above our class
and we'll give this pipe the name of
reverse string and you'll notice that we
need to implement the interface named
pipe transform when we implement the
transform function it gives us the
current value and any other arguments we
can return the value we can split that
by character so we have an array we can
then reverse
the array and join it together now when
we use this pipe throughout our project
we shan't be able to get a reversed
version of our string so let's head over
to our shared module and we can add a
declarations of the reverse string and I
will also add the word pipe on the end
of our class to conform with these style
guidelines and inside of our shared
module we can import that new pipe so
now we can head over to our app module
and we can import our shared module that
comes from our shared folder slash
shared module inside of all our
components I'm then going to make a new
paragraph and inside of the paragraph
I'm going to have a name and like before
we will add a name into our app
component don TS so simply have name
equals paul we all bind on at the name
variable and then we'll add the reverse
string pipe you'll see that reverse a
string could not be found and that's
because we're using a shared module and
when we're using a shared module we also
need to export using exports the same
pipe
this allows our other modules to then
gain access to this pipe you'll notice
when we save our file we then have our
reversed pipe so this is how we create a
custom pipe inside of angular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
