native applications with the Android SDK
so this allows us to make purely native
Android applications with languages such
as Java or : now for this you may need
some dependencies such as the Java
development kits and a variety of other
things so what I suggest that you do is
download Android studio and work
backwards to see what you actually need
on your machine so what you want to do
is hit download Android studio from
developer.android.com and after this you
should then setup the Android SDK if you
simply follow the installation process
that should tell you what you actually
need and what you currently don't have
on your system just follow up through
the process as best that you can and
install the appropriate SDK elements at
this point we should then see a welcome
to Android studio screen I want you to
then head start a new Android studio
project we can then give this
application a name such as hello world
we want to change the company demand so
this will be simply our bundle ID so I'm
gonna put the company demand app all
Halliday daemul and then I'm gonna hit
next we don't want to include : support
or C++ support at this point I'm fine at
setting the minimum SDK to FBI 15 but
you may need to change this depending on
what features you're looking to use
inside of your application at this point
let's set next and then we have a
variety of different activities now you
can think of activities as your views as
your sort of pages inside of the app
we're simply going to select empty
activity this one for now will be called
main activity as it will be the only
activity that we'll have and we'll hit
finish so at this point we should be
given a mainactivity.java and an
activity underscore min don't
XML before we dive into all of this and
how this works I want to have a look at
the folder structure so underneath up
here we have M manifests a Java and
res folder the Java folder contains all
of the source files for our project so
as you can see it does contain our main
activity so this is essentially the
class for our activity so anything that
we'd want to do inside of our activity
we could simply interact with inside of
this main activity class we also have a
res folder and that's for our resources
so these are usually things like
drawable objects other things like the
min underscore activity dot xml is the
view for our activity and that resides
in the layout folder we also have a
folder such as values and that contents
things like our application colors
specific string constants and so on
outside of the res folder we also have
in manifests folder and that just
contains the settings for our
application things like the different
permissions that our application needs
and so on finally we have a look at the
Gradle scripts and this is the grill
file which contains different things
such as our compatible SDK versions our
dependencies and where we get them
dependencies from so if we take a look
at our main activity don't Java we can
sort of have an idea of what this
actually does it starts off by
implementing its own oncreate function
and by using this over right here it's
taking the app compat activity and
overriding the oncreate function but
whenever we override we have to call
super and this is because we're calling
the constructor of this app compat
activity and if we take a look at that
app compat activity dot Java you can see
that it's just ensuring that the themes
are set up correctly setting up our view
and so on this allows us to then use set
content view and if we take a look at
this what this actually does is it gets
the current view delegates and it sets
the content view to the layout that we
specify and the layout that we set
inside of the main activity is the
activity underscore main dot XML and the
way that we access that is by this r dot
layout so this is essentially saying
that we want to go inside of the res
folder and then the layout folder to get
the activity under SCORM in
essentially the main activity here on
the oncreate function is assigning this
view if we wanted to set a different
view we could create another layout and
instead find that by using our layout
and if we had an activity underscore
hello we could use activity underscore
hello but we don't so that's why we have
this red arrow text so that's how it
works we essentially are creating a new
view we're setting the content view
inside of the activity and you'll find
that we do this for every single
activity that we create any time we want
to create a view we are using this set
content view by overriding the oncreate
function if we take a look now at the
activity underscore main you can see
that we do have this hello world in the
middle of the screen as well as
different things such as the drag and
drop we cured if we wanted to drag on a
button to the screen and you'll notice
by doing so we are adding something to
the component tree so we can add various
different layouts to this component tree
and you'll notice that at this moment in
time we aren't putting this button of
part of a particular layout so what
happens is that it doesn't have any sort
of constraints what we can do is add a
relative layout and put the button
inside of that relative layout and your
motor starter by doing so the button
goes to the top left of the screen but
perhaps you don't like the sort of
design view what we can do is click text
on the bottom here and this allows us to
see the text output for the XML that the
UI creates so if you probably remove
this tools layout editor absolute Y and
absolute x because we don't want to put
the button at an absolute position on
screen we can change the text of our
button to be hello world and you'll
notice that it's telling us that we
shouldn't hard called strings and this
just goes back to the res folder that
was talking about earlier well we have
this string so what we can do is hit
this hello world here and we can hit the
light bulb and hit
striked storing a resource we could call
this resource hello world and place an
inside of these stirrings file you'll
notice not the android studio ide then
changes our text to point towards that
appropriate string so now we have it
here inside of the string xml file so
what I'd like to do now is head over to
the main activity dot Java and inside of
here I want to get a reference to the
button so let's create a new button
which comes from Android widgets so if
you haven't already you can import that
from Android widget button and we can
call this the HelloWorld button then
inside of our on create function we can
set the hello world button equal to it
finds view by ID and we want to look for
this button by ID so we know that this
is a button and they find view by ID
knows this as you can see here it's a
type of Android door widget button so
what we then need to do is go back over
to our activity mentor XML and select
the button and give this an ID of hello
world button therefore we can set our
dot ID dot hello world button inside of
this find view by ID well this is
essentially doing is finding the
resource don't ID with the ID of hello
world button once we have this we can
set an onclicklistener by using set on
click listener
and we'll apply this to the
onclicklistener but at this point in
time you'll notice that we do have this
aura and that's because we haven't
implemented the onclicklistener
interface so let's use implements on
click listener and the one that we're
going to use is not dialog interfaces
instead from a view so this comes from
Android dot view so we then have an
issue with the class because we aren't
implementing the appropriate methods for
on-click so let's then implement the
methods and you can either type that or
you can let Android studio credit for
you essentially what we're doing is were
overriding the onclick methods of the
view to onclicklistener
and what this does is it expects a view
here and then we can determine which
view was clicked by determining if the
view itself is equal to the hello world
button now if that is equal to the hello
world button perhaps we have some other
buttons inside of this app so we could
either use a switch or we could use
multiple if statements we want to do
something so I want to create a textview
and that's got to be called hello world
title let's make sure that we import the
text view from Android widget text view
so let's make sure that we select this
textview and we give this the ID of
hello world title and we want to then
set up this textview inside of the
oncreate function we can say hello world
title is equal to a find view by ID this
time add the ID of hello world title
then inside of our onclicklistener
we can simply set the hello world title
using set text to be hello Paul
let's run our application at the top by
hitting this play button and this may
take some time after you actually select
the button to get up and running but you
should then either select a device that
you have connected to your machine or a
virtual device if you haven't set up a
virtual device go ahead and stop it
device to run this on now using the AVD
manager and as always when you do
creates an emulator and you boot it up
but will take some time so just be
patient with that maybe go get a coffee
and come back and the application shall
be on screen so here we have our
application if we have the HelloWorld
button you'll notice that our text
updates in the middle of the screen to
say hell or Paul quite simple and I hope
it acts as a decent overview how to get
started with Android studio so what have
we achieved inside of this lecture what
we've learned about making new buttons
and making the text views we've created
these variables inside of our app we've
then instantiate these variables inside
of on creates we're using find view by
ID and we're finding the appropriate ID
that we set inside of the view for each
one of these items so we have this
button we have this textview could even
rename this to be textview if we wanted
to and at the same time we're then
setting an onclicklistener using the
view dot onclicklistener
to then capture when that view is
clicked inside of the on click function
so we're checking to see whether that
view was the view that we created up
here if it is we're setting the text to
say hello Paul we've also looked at
various different things about the
different folders different build scrubs
for resources and so on if you'd like to
see more native Android content please
let me know inside of the comments
section below and if you'd like to
support the content don't forget I do
have a period of err a patreon.com slash
Paul Halliday it does fund the YouTube
videos and of course I have a
subscription site over at Paul Halliday
don't I or you may be interested in all
of them and until next time I'll see you
soon in my next video
of this new crazy mother
