looking at something called monks which
is step management for moon GS so it's
easier than you think and of course step
management is always s scary words so
let's jump in by making a new directory
called moon - monks inside of here I
want to make an index to HTML and also
an app GS will then open this up inside
of our editor and run this inside of
HTTP server so let's start off inside of
our index dot HTML and we can make a new
HTML file by saying HTML colon 5
I'll change the title to be mundo GS
monks and inside of our body we need to
make a div for the ID of app this is
where we'll be mounting our moon
instance next we want to import
development mode moon and that comes
from unpackage comm slash moon jess /
dist / moon dot 2 GS so that allows us
to use moon GS inside of our application
we then want to import monks and that
comes from unpackage once again but this
time simply slash monks the final thing
that we need to do is our app GS and
that's simply our moon application so
now that we have all of that we can head
over to a vis and the first thing I'd
like to do is tell moon we're using
monks and in order to tell moon we can
use moon dot use and as we have monks in
the global scope we can use monks
next we need to create a store so we can
say Khan store is equal to in new monks
and inside of our store we need to
define what our state looks like I'm
simply going to make a counter in which
we can either increment or decrement a
counter by 1 so our state will contain a
counter and that will be by default
number 1 then we can define some actions
so the actions are simply a function
that contains the states and a payload
so if you imagine our current state dark
counter would be 1 and if we want to
increment that by a number we would pass
through 1 to this function and that
would be our payload so what we would
say is state counter plus equal the
payload so when we call this action in
the future we're simply going to be
saying increment 1 that'll all make
sense in a second but let's make the
same for decrement that includes the
state and the payload once again so we
can set the counter this time to minus
equal B pay Lord
and that's it for our actions so we
don't need to create any other actions
at this point but you may want to add
other actions into your store inside of
this actions or object so the next thing
to do is to define a new moon instance
and we'll put that equal to up
and inside of our moon instance and ones
make the elements equal to up and that's
the idea of up and if we look at our
index to HTML you can see that we have
the div id of up here next we can tell
this instance that we want to use the
store and that comes from the store
which we created here which is a new
monks and inside of our moon instance I
want to create a template perhaps we can
have a div with a h1 and the h1 walk on
10 our store dot state don't counter and
if we take a look at our store we can
see that we have our store here our
state's which then contains our counter
variable so initially that's going to be
1 so we can see a counselor core 1 and
underneath we can have 2 buttons the
first button could say increment and the
second button can say detriment
each one of these can have an on-click
instance by using em - on call on Clank
and we could say equals increments and
equals decrement so far though we have
normal function called increments and no
function called decrement inside of this
moon instance we do have these things as
actions inside of the store but what we
have to do is create some methods so the
methods I'm going to create an increment
and also a decrement but instead of
interacting with the data inside of this
instance what I'm going to do is call a
particular action so we can say store
dot dispatch and what this does is it
allows us to pass through a name of the
action for example increments and then a
payload so if we wanted to increment by
one we would simply say 1 here we could
dispatch another option for decrement
I'd do the same by 1 what I like to do
in circumstances like this is just to
make sure that I'm not making any typos
I like to create a actions Jack and hold
as an object so for example we'd have
increments as increment and this is case
sensetive because we are calling that
function or rather calling that action
so then we could simply say actions
don't increment and actions don't
decrement so once we save our file and
we take a look inside of the bronzer we
now have our counter we can use
increment to increment this upwards or
decrement to take this back down to zero
or even put into the minuses
so this is how we could use the store
inside of our moon applications and also
how we can fire actions off how we can
return a new version of our state
as well as ensure that we don't have any
typos when we're calling our actions so
this is when we're dispatching our
actions instead of using the string we
are then dispatching this object
we aren't limited to what we can pass
the brew here so if we had a object that
we passed through as a payload we could
have number equals to one and instead
we'd have to change our increments to be
payload number so if we refresh this we
get the same our counter would go up and
we can even console dot log the payload
so we could see this inside of the
console you'll notice now if we had
increment would you just get simply that
number which is one I could do the same
for stairs and if we refresh the page we
could see that currently we have counter
which allows us to get and set the state
so in this video we've taken a look at
how we can use monks inside of our moon
applications we've created a store we
now have stared objects that we could
hold as many objects as we wanted in our
state we have actions that when
dispatched we can create a new version
of our state's we've also injected our
store into our moon instance and we can
see the results of that by binding it to
our stored on state counter inside of
our moon instance we're dispatching the
actions and we've used an object to
ensure a type safety to a certain degree
as we could certainly miss type our
strings so I hope you've enjoyed this
