- and by the end of this video you will
have made if barcode scanning
application then you can use on your iOS
Android or Windows Phone device now the
awesome thing about this bar chord
plug-in is that you can actually encode
your own barcodes from data within your
app - so let's get started in making our
bar chord app run ionic start bar chords
the line kit - - of B - this makes a new
application named bar code based on the
blank template and of course it's an
ionic - up because of the - - B - now
that's done we can see D into bar code
then we need to install two other
packages firstly let's run ionic plugin
adds form gap plugin bar chord scanner
this will install the Cordova plug-in
and after that we need to include the
ionic negative reference for that plugin
npm install - - save our tonic - native
/ bar chord - scanner i'm going to be
running this on my android device so i'm
then going to add the android platform
ionic platform adds android and then you
go to run it on the android device by
using ionic run android - el the - shell
means that it's going to be a library
lord server so if i change anything -
with NPS chord it will automatically run
on the device while lap sermon I'm going
to open a new tab and then open vs chord
using chords dot okay so the first thing
we do is navigate over to app module don
TS then from ionic native / barcode
scanner we need to import barcode
scanner after that add it to the list of
providers you have to do this with every
eye on it native plug-in that you decide
to add to the project that's why we do
is finish bar splash screen and of
course our barcode scanner
then head over to home at dot html' I'm
going to change the title to ionic
barcode scanner and I'm going to change
the color to primary after that we'll
need a button and the button will simply
say scan that barcode inside of the home
component we can import from the barcode
scanner the barcode scanner and the
barcode scanner options
so now we'll simply make an empty
options variable of type of barcode
scanner options then we can get an
instance of the barcode scanner by
adding private bar chords F type barcode
scanner inside of our constructor and
finally we can make an async function
named scan barcode and now we can use
the instance of barcode scanner to call
the scan method so let's all be resolved
results inside a variable named results
so constant results is equal to the
resolved from us of this the barcode
does scan you'll notice that scanner
takes barcode scanner options as a
parameter and we'll look at ways in
which we can customize that in just a
moment for now simply call the dot scan
method then we can log the results out
to the console so once we've done that
we can simply go over to our home HTML
and hook up the scan bar chord function
you'll notice not to use a sink under
way it will have the target es6 within
our TF config JSON change your target
from es5 to es6 and then reset the file
and it should work I'm going to pull up
a bar chord here on my mic and then I'm
going to use my device to scan that and
we should see the results in the console
so after scanning the barcode you can
see that I had this text this format and
we didn't cancel B scan if we wanted we
could display these results in the UI by
simply making a results object
and then you think this lot results is
equal to the result that we resolved
from us we can change our logs payment
to be desktop results and inside of our
HTML we can make any depth we can under
ng-if to only display if the results
exist then we can simply add paragraph
tags to say results dot txt results dot
formats and results dot cancelled as you
can see we have the text the format's
and the cancellation value I'm going to
press scan barcodes and then I'm going
to come back so I'm going to press the
back button
we have canceled equals true I mentioned
that you can have options within the
barcode scanner options let's have a
look at some of the options that we
could set we have things like profile
front camera
sure the flip camera button should be
torch button prompt and so on in this
example I'm simply going to add a prompt
so if we use those two options and then
we can add prompt simply say something
like scan a barcode to see the results
then inside of our disk barcode scan
method we can simply add our options and
if I press the scan a barcode button
again I get a scan a barcode to see the
result
the barcode scanner also works with QR
codes for example I'm going to scan a QR
code right now and we can see that the
result was QR strathcom the format was
QR codes and cancelled was false for a
full list of the things that this plugin
can scan check out the PhoneGap plug-in
barcode scanners github repository now
this plug-in can also encode data as a
barcode or QR code for example we can
write the function async and code data
and then we can pass through some data
so for example we'll use a weight
they've got barcodes or encode and the
type that will
or be this top bar chord the end cord
with a capital e and then you can see we
have either email type phone type SMS
type or text type also great news text
type for now and then we need some data
so I'll simply type HTTP learn ionic to
calm and as this is a promise we simply
use a meet your wait keywords and we'll
map that to the results like that now
one thing about this plug-in is that it
doesn't seem to be that well supported
on Android when we are encoding data
I've not the start anything after the
promise doesn't seem to run and I think
that's simply because it opens up in a
different web page than your app if
anybody has any ideas about this let me
know in the comment section below
but for now I'll give you an example of
that so if we've opened up in Holmdel
HTML we can simply make another button
and we have encode data and if we click
encode you won't be able to see it
because it's actually on the device but
it brings up a QR code and says
underneath learn ionic to calm so that's
about the extent as the PhoneGap barcode
scanner plugin I hope that helped you if
you're looking to make a barcode scanner
application and if it did hit that
