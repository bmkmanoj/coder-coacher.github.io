for my visual studio chord setup so I
thought I'd make a video explaining that
the themes that I use the plugin values
and my settings saw so number one let's
start with the theme the theme that I
use is named one dark prahl and this can
be found on the store by simply typing
one dog Pro another theme I'm quite a
big fan of is Nord then you can find
that on the store too and named Nords
it's a sort of blueish theme similar to
this one but instead of dark colors it's
a much more brighter theme so Nord is
quite cool and so it's worn dog Pro I
love to know what themes you use let me
know in the comment section below
and the next thing that I hafta show is
obviously my settings so when you find a
sentence by going through preferences
and settings now my font size is 20
because I'm recording a lot and when I'm
recording I need to make sure that
everybody can see what we're doing I
have word wrap on as well so that
automatically wraps on to the next line
i experiment quite a lot with the latest
typescript version so I have the TSC
version sets of false and as I work on
and then seeing amounts of projects I do
have the window reopened folders equal
to 0 just I can focus on what's
important the font family that I use at
the moment isn't monocle I'm always
looking for different fonts opera looks
quite cool but I still have yet to ship
out the two hundred-pound for that if
you haven't seen operator before quite a
few people do user and the cordon space
the zoom level yet again it's just
sembly 3 because I'm recording I exclude
all the files sometimes I change this to
be different ones like I might add
anything / yes here if I'm working with
typescript and JavaScript and the
JavaScript files are in the same file
I do exclude quite a few files
oftentimes I change this a lot when I'm
working in projects that have JavaScript
and typescript and the same files or
folders and we could simply do J SEO
equals the true and that would obviously
hide all the JavaScript files I'm a big
fan of quick suggestions and I add this
in my editor so like in my comment
strings and other slicer everything
here's our true similar things for other
languages I disabled the welcome enabled
so I don't really have the welcome
pop-up on vs chords the
contain that I use and if we did have a
project open here we do have these
settings that Jess on auburn is vs sette
and that comes with visual studio cord
as far as i'm aware to enable like you
press command p icon and then set your
file icon theme to be set e next color
theme that's simply for the theme one
don't prompt if I'm using the font that
comes with some particular characters
for cording I'll add this setting with
Rance two TS length I like to make sure
everything's formatted as much as
possible so whenever I save the file it
automatically fixes the file fix in the
sense of format the file I'm
experimenting with these other two on
format on type and format on pace this
automatically formats the file whenever
you paste or type something in the
editor I currently have mouse wheels
returned off the cursor style is aligned
but sometimes I change this to block
like so I do find that using block is a
bit annoying when we're making videos
but if people like it and they want to
see that we can leave it on block I'm
also currently disabling translate3d
because you might have saw in under the
kendo UI videos but when we actually
moved around the document there's a lot
of flash and on screen so until that's
fixed I'm using this the civil translate
3d equals the true that seems to fix it
for me I've not really tried turning off
yet and I don't really need to something
to leave it true for now but I wouldn't
suggest that you said this and of course
I also have confirm sync is set to false
when I'm pushing to my git repositories
just to make sure I don't make any
mistakes so that's about it for my user
settings the next thing that people are
asking me about quite a bit is this
references and these references here are
to do with courtland's now I was fairly
sure that I said this manually so maybe
something has changed in this regard but
if we head back to these settings maybe
we can turn this off if we type editor
dot cord lens equal to false and you can
see we no longer have that references so
if you want to add the references make
sure that you add cord lands equal to
true so I'm going to pull this back edit
setup cord length equal to true and I
think that's by default it might be
default for me or could just be the fact
that I use the insiders edition of cord
and that's something that's coming along
or it might be because I've got called
lens installed and potentially you don't
so if you're looking for that it's all
to do with the editor door cord lands
setting as I've switch to visual studio
cord insiders build and we have too many
plugins because the plugins don't come
along with that but the plugins that
I've been using the last week are
especially the angular language service
if you use my angular you definitely
need this as you can see and the skiff
here gives you autocomplete of the
properties and methods inside of your
component class as well as components
throughout the application and much more
the next thing I'm using is the fuse
language and that gives me syntax
highlighting for you know and to doyou
x-files and then using things like the
build blog and this is an unofficial
plugin but allows us to get the output
panel of the fuse preview inside of the
escort so if there's any errors with the
fuse up I get to see it straight inside
the editor I don't have to tap out and
see my terminal
it also condenses it down to so if I run
fuse preview inside of the vs cord
terminal I might find that we get a load
more logs than we actually need so this
just allows us to see the log message
quickly and easily come to think of it I
also need to install the output
colorizer plugin so do that if you're
looking for colorization of the log
files so the next thing is obviously the
one dark troll and this is my current
theme the next is things like the
colorizer like I just said so if we are
looking for colors inside of the vs cord
terminal this is how we get that next is
Python now simply for running Python
stuff inside of our vs cords
Cuoco jeaious i did a video on this if
you haven't seen already and this loves
to essentially see the results of our
javascript in a playground fashion
within vs chords and finally these
things like TS length and es leds TS
length allows us to take advantage of
all the limping things that we're using
inside of the settings so I definitely
recommend this things like the Auto
fixing and some other prettifying rules
and that is about there that's the
settings I use the theme I use any
extensions that I use and I can't think
of anything else that I've missed within
@bs cords like I said I also use the
insiders build you can find that on the
visual studio chord website if you
display them to Google visual studio
chord and sliders should be able to find
the next build that is not yet released
if I've missed something or you'd like
to share something that you use inside
of your visual studio chords I'd love to
hear that let me know in the comment
section below and until that time my
name is Paul here not subscribe button
to stay updated and I'll see you very
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
