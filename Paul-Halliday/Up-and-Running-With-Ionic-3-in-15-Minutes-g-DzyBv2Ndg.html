how do I even get started with ionic in
the first place I do a lot of ionic
videos and most of them assume that you
already know something about it or
you've already got your system set up
correctly
this video is for people that have never
used ionic before and are looking to
download the command-line NFS so they
can get started in creating some ionic
applications to start with and sure that
you've got nord GS installed head over
to nords GS org if you're on Windows and
if you want to Mac use hora
so homebrew is a package manager for Mac
OS and it makes getting different
packages such as Nord it's super easy
it also means you don't have to install
Nord by using something called pseudo
and that means we have to use admin
permissions for Nord and can cause a
whole host of issues with dependencies
security and much more so make sure you
download homebrew by running this
command in your console and when you've
done that we can use brew install node
so run brew install nodes and like said
on Windows make sure you've downloaded
the current version of nodes and
installed that after which on life like
I said if you've run brew install node
we should be ready to go we can then
install ionic and Cordova so you can
think of ionic as the UI layer for your
mobile application it provides us with
loads of components such as nav bars
cards buttons all that as file depending
on the platform the user users on your
application so if you've got an Android
device it'll look like a material design
iOS will look like iOS human interface
guidelines windows form a look like
Windows Phone and so on
Cordova on the other hand is what we use
to build our packages to an FPGA for
Androids
IPO for iOS and the other file types for
those specific platforms we can also
again access the things like the camera
SMS and a variety of other native
features with Cordova plugins let's
install them using the NPM package
manager that we just installed with
Nords via brew and Viet nor Jess
depending on your platform we can
interact with nord in the command line
by running NPM and that's the package
manager for node so all these different
packages like ionic Cordova angular all
run on something called
NPM so by using NPM we can install
packages such as ionic and Cordova
globally on our system we can do that by
running the - G command after the
package name so we could do this twice
and run NPM install ionic - G and then
NPM install Cordova - G but we can put
them together to install them both at
the same time so the - G installs these
packages globally on your system and
allows us to execute the executables
inside of the command line path
otherwise we would have to navigate to a
particular folder all the time to talk
to the binaries of ionic Cordova and the
variety of other packages that we'll be
using
so once you have run that we should be
able to have access to the ionic
command-line interface type ionic inside
of your command line when that's done
and you should gain access to a variety
of commands you can see here we have a
variety of tasks we also have the - page
or help for more information on
particular tasks if we see the ionic
start starts a new ionic project in the
specified pack so if we see the Intel
reports directory or whatever folder
that you want to use we can make a new
ionic project running ionic start and
that will run it in this path but you
can also define a path if you want to
now after that we need a name for the
project so my project name is the nympho
project you can call whatever you want
and then we can use something called
it's now a template is a variety of
different starter projects that we can
use on the ionic CLI so we could start
with the tabs template and as I've
expected a template with some tabs at
the bottom of the screen we also can use
the side menu template which has a side
value there's different ones such as
blank which are also completely blank
and just in navbar the top I'd like to
use that one and then sort of bootstrap
the different things that I want
throughout my application I suggest you
play with them all and you'll be able to
get an understanding of how everything
works by doing that so at the moment I'm
going to run it ionic start to my
project name blank and then we're going
to use - - at v2 at this level of the
CLI we have to add - - v2 to make an
ionic - or ionic authority project if we
didn't add the - - v2 it would make an
ionic 1 project in angularjs so let's
run that command as you can see it's
creating an ionic app based on the blank
templates it's pulling the starter apps
from github and installing the NPM
packages for that starter package it
might take a little while to install the
NPM packages but once that's finished we
can see D which is change directory into
that directory so let's a CD into my
project named we can then run our
project on a variety of different
platforms some of these are emulator the
browser and directly on the phone itself
so now I'm going to run ionic serves and
if we look up at the serve at the top
here we can see that it starts a local
development server for app development
or testing so let's run ionic serve
we're then created with the ionic blank
template inside of our browser I like to
right click and then click inspect and
at the bottom left of our console here
click the little device toolbar this
will make your application appear as if
it's on a mobile device it will make the
screen size the appropriate screen size
of the device that you've selected and
also change the theme so at the moment
we're using the galaxy s5 as an example
I can click this drop-down and then
select iPhone six-plus if I then refresh
the page it will then look like an iOS
application the same can be done for
Windows if I select a Microsoft Lumia
950 and refresh again it looks like a
Windows application this is one of the
powers of ionic the user interface can
contextually change depending on the
platform that your application is
running on now I've got some videos on
how you can actually take this much
further by using the ionic platform
service as well as theming it for
specific platforms if you want to use
the same platform across all platforms
this means you could use material design
across iOS and windows form but I
suggest it's just using the platform
specific user interfaces for now let's
quickly take a look at the code inside
of our project I'm going to use Visual
Studio chord for this and I'm going to
run code dot this is essentially you can
open up the project inside a visual
studio chord so let's take a look at the
different folder structures of an ionic
3 application we start off with the
hulk's folder now the Hawks folder means
we can add specific script to the build
time of our application using Cordova as
you can see we can hug in at different
stages of the lifecycle such as after
build after compile after emulates after
adding a platform and before all of
these events and much more the Cordova
huts are usually advanced functionality
and you might not even have to touch
them in your entire life that being an
ionic developer it really depends on the
use case of your application and what
you want to do at build time before
build time and a variety of other things
some examples for Cordova honks before
build you could increment the version
number of your application and a variety
of other things if we move on to the
nord modules folder we can see we have a
variety of different dependencies inside
of our project some ones that stand out
are angular ionic ionic native and much
more this just represents the
dependencies in our project and any time
we run npm install the dependencies that
we install for example ionic angular and
so on all get added to the node modules
further next we have a platforms for BRR
now platforms can be iOS Android Windows
Phone and many more we can add them by
using Cordova and we installed Cordova
not long ago
some example usage of adding air
platform would be using ionic platform
ads and then the name of the platform
now I already have the Android SDK
installed so when I run ionic platform
ad Android this will add the Android
platform to our project setting up the
Android SDK can take a long time because
not only is a big SDK but it also
requires some configuration inside your
system environment variables now I would
advise installing it yet again using it
brew if you are a Mac user so you can
just type brew install Android - SDK and
inside of a Windows machine
I would advise going to the Android
studio website download and everything
and installing all the dependencies I do
have many more guides around the Android
SDK and setting up in your ionic
projects on the way so stick around and
make sure you subscribe to see more
information on that one
finishing see the Android was then added
to our platforms folder next we have the
plugins so plugins are different Cordova
plugins that we can add to our ionic
application so for example we can see
the keyboards splash screen status bar
and more so this represents the keyboard
plug-in so it can interface with the
keyboard on the forum the status bar of
the Android device the splash screen of
the application and much more so you can
add new plugins to our ionic projects by
running ionic plug-in ads and then the
name of the plugin we'd also need to add
the ionic native wrapper for that
plug-in and I have a variety of guides
on how to do this with plugins like SMS
the camera the flashlight and much more
next we can take a look at the resources
directory so the Resources directory
represents the icon and splash screen of
our application if we click icon we can
see this is the current icon and the
splash screen of our app we can generate
these within the ionic CLI so if we look
inside Android icon we can see we have
everything from the smallest definition
to the highest definition icon as well
as splash screens and much more instead
of making all these sizes yourself you
can instead run ionic resources and
providing you've got the icon and splash
screen inside of your resource directory
that'll automatically generates the
appropriate sizes next we'll look at the
source directory so the source directory
contains all of the source code for our
application if we click up we have our
main app module inside of angular here
we have the different pages that are
associated with the application for
example home and we have stuff like the
theme
we can change the colors and assets such
as icons and much more these concepts
have been explored further in past
videos and will also be explored in
future videos too
finally we have the WWF older and this
represents the build of our application
so we write everything inside of
typescript that gets then transpiled to
JavaScript and tools like web pack help
us with this so if we look in old builds
folder we can see many es now this is
what gets executed in the browser after
everything's being transpiled down to
standard javascript and you couldn't
possibly write this or read this but
essentially what it is it's the result
of the transpiration of our typescript
and the variety of other build steps to
make our application run let's say we're
happy with our project and we want to
build it for production we could head
over to our command line and use the
ionic CLI to build our project in
production mode so ionic build and if we
want to build for Android we could use
ionic build Androids and then we can
possibly - - prod flag this lens your
maximum performance of the application
and then sure that all files are
minified when we build for production
you've now made an application you've
built this full production and then if
somebody says I want to change the name
of the app how do we do out well inside
of all conflict or XML we can change the
name here under the AMT and change that
to for example my cool project we can
also change the descriptions or a
description of the project the author
and a variety of other metadata all this
stuff here but a long intense
preferences and plugins is really
important and we'll investigate that in
future videos be bundle mam of your
application here can also be changed to
match what you put on the App Store's so
if you define this for the App Store and
you're asked for a bundle ID this is the
bundle ID that you need to change and
match up on the store the package JSON
will determine all the different
dependencies inside your app and when we
run NPM install and then a package name
so if we run NPM install at angular
slash HTTP the angular HTTP would be
installed two node modules but it
wouldn't be committed to our package
JSON unless we included the - - save
inside of our terminal when we're
installing the package something to keep
in mind
we can end this video by heading over to
source pages and inside of our home dot
HTML we can change the text of our home
page - so in my first application and
the title of our page can be my
application or whatever the title you
want to add and if we save this you can
see it builds automatically in the
browser and then tada are we get the my
application the title of a navbar and
inside that we get our paragraph which
is my first application
I hope you found this quickfire
introduction to ionic three very useful
and if you have hit that subscribe
button because there's many more videos
on the way and until that time I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
