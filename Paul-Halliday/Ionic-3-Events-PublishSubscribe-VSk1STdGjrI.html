going to talk about events within ionic
2 today we're going to make a very quick
application that allows you to simply
push an event from your home components
and within a second component we're
going to display a toss
when that receives the event this will
all make sense in a moment so start off
by making a project and call it my
events based on these blank templates
and ensure it's a v2 so that means it's
an ionic 2 app alright our projects
finished let's see d2 my events and then
I'm going to serve up running ionic
serve that should make it appear in the
browser you don't need any third-party
plugins to do this everything is inside
ionic so we'll start off inside our home
components so if we navigate to pages
then home I'm simply going to delete
everything inside ion content and I'll
change the title or the application to
ionic 2 events give myself a colored
navbar and then I'm going to add a form
so within this form it's simply going to
be I on item then we'll have a label and
this will make sense in a second and I
put name and an eye on input after the
item we'll need a button so at the
islands button tag and we'll be able to
say submit event
so essentially we're going to add
something to this name and when we click
Submit vent it will then dish or toast
at the bottom of the screen instead of
putting the event inside our home page
I'm going to demonstrate this by making
its second component so head back over
to your terminal and type I oh make G
component and we'll call the component
hello
so as you can see under components we
have hello and we need to add this to
our app module so imports from
components hello hello
and we can add hello component with an
import and then add it to our
declarations to check that this worked
will simply add hello in our home to
HTML and you can see that we get hello
world from our hell or
I'm going to remove the text for now and
inside hello I'm going to import the
toast controller from ionic annular and
then I'll add a definition to our
constructor will then make a function
inside of our hello component named sure
tools and will simply make a function
that shows a toast so this top toast got
create and then was their message is
equal to hello is a duration of three
seconds so nothing too crazy out of yem
inside of our constructor will show the
toast and we see we get this component
down here saying hello now what we want
to do is make an event inside of our
homes or TS so that when we fire off
this event here the hello component
subscribes to that event and then show
the toast and says hello to that
particular name so in home TS we need to
import events from ionic angular we then
need to instantiate inside of our
constructor so the private event events
and then we'll make a function name
submit event we can use the events that
we just created by doing disco event
publish and then we need a name so at
the moment we'll just call it hello you
can call us anything you wanted
essentially it is basically subscribing
to this particular event inside the
component so we're going to call the
hello and then we need some things to
pass through the event so these are the
arguments I'll say just any name for now
so forth and we can pick up this event
inside of our component so we need to do
a similar thing inside of our hello
components we need to import events and
then pose in our constructor and now we
can simply do this dot event dot
subscribe and essentially we're looking
for that topic so that name so remember
we said hello and when we get the data
we simply want to assure the
tossed and we're going to pass through
the name here so instead of death or I'm
going to call it nem so pass further
than M and within the function we're
simply going to add them and it's going
to be a type of string so we can then
say hello and then the name of the
person so if we have uncle over to
Holmes at PS we can see that we have
this submit event function if we add
that to our button by going here
click Submit event when we click the
button we should get hello Paul and
that's simply because Paul is the
argument to our hello topic that we're
publishing over here then in our hello
component we'll simply subscribe into
the event and B name which is the data
that we put as the argument here is
captured and we're showing the toast
based on that name so all we need to do
now to add some this pork data is simply
make an M of type string and then inside
the ion inputs we can add the ng model
to be tighten in which means we can go
back to our submit event function and
replace we Paul with this dot name now
if we type anything inside of our
imports we could say hello Dave and we
would get hello Dave as an alert I hope
I've managed to accurately describe the
events functionality within ionic 2 if I
have and this video has helped you then
I'd love for you to hit that subscribe
button down below and of course check
