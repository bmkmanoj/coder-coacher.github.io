rectangle example unlock down the tapped
events or inside of our rectangle here
you can add a tab and that means
whenever we tap this rectangle we can do
a particular event now if you remember
this event done at the bottom here is
well pressed so while pressed if we
click the rectangle it changes the color
and of course rotates this 180 degrees
you could do something different while
we tap it also could have a different
animation if we tap the rectangle so
this one is held down if we simply tap
it it could be something different so
maybe you want to do something like in
move and with the move we could change
the x and y so if we add a Y and for now
I'll add a hundreds and an X of 50 and a
duration of perhaps half a second so it
takes half a second for the rest handle
to move and we simply just click or tap
the rectangle we can see that it starts
to move but for now I'll also comment on
to this while pressed so we can see this
in its entirety so if we click the
rectangle we see it moves down by 100 Y
and 50 X when dealing with animations we
also have something called an easing and
this is how we want the animation to
move over a curve for example we have
things like bouncing bounce out circular
N and so on if we take one of these for
example and said easing equal to
exponential and out and we can't put our
rectangle you can see that it sort of
takes a different path so than before if
we use something like bounce in and we
tub you can see it takes an entirely
different path if we use something like
kortek in Alps you can see that also
takes a different path so there's
different easing values that we can use
we don't necessarily have to stop a
movement but we could also use a skill
so scale allows us to change the width
and height of our rectangle by a
particular factor so if we changed it by
a factor of three we would think that
our rectangle would get significantly
bigger and if we click it our rectangle
we of course see a much bigger rectangle
but perhaps that's too quick so let's
say we have a duration if instead 0.5
and if we save the file you can see that
it also gets bigger at a smaller rate we
can change this to be 100 100 for X&amp;amp;Y
and maybe put the duration to be
something like 2 and if we change the
factor of our scale to be a little bit
smaller maybe you could find use for
that animation somewhere know exactly
where but there we have it we've liked a
movement and skill within our fuse
applications I should also add that the
skill here is obviously the best scale
factor of 1 so we'd have to change that
to 2 or anything higher or below the
scaling factor so we could say 0.5 and
this would make it smaller but I know
what you're thinking we have this thing
here what if we wanted to move this
again but maybe we wanted to change the
movement to instead be delayed by maybe
a second and then the eggs would go to
200 well our dad to be duration of 1
this to be a duration of 2 so this is
delayed one second and then our other
movement starts let's take a look at
that
so if we save the file and run the
animation we see that it gets smaller it
moves it moves again off screen after
that second comes back to the initial
moved flesh and then finally goes back
to the initial skill and the initial
starting point if we change this to be
200 100's we would see our box so we
could do the skin so we can see oh
throughout all of the movement so you do
actually have quite powerful animation
system in fuse and if you'd like to see
more fuse videos then of course head to
that subscribe button let me know what
you'd like to see in the comment section
below and until then I'll see you very
soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
