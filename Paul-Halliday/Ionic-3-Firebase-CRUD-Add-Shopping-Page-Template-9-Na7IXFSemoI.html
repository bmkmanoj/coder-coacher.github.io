ad shopping page let's create ourselves
it templates for my ad shopping page we
can change the title to have a space
inside of the ID shopping we can also
add a color of primary to the nav bar
and inside of our ion content we can add
some text boxes you can add as many as
you want
but I'll start off by adding an eye on
item and that's eye on item will contain
an eye on label the label will be
floating and the first item on our list
will be the item name we'll add an input
field so that the user can input a
particular item name by default the type
of this is text so we don't have to
define that but we will in this
circumstance just so we can make that
obvious and then what I also want to do
is copy this and we'll paste that below
so as well as having an item name we can
also have a number so that will be the
number of items we can add the type here
to be number instead of text then that
will change the keyboard for the user so
instead of guessing a QWERTY keyboard
when we select this field they'll get
numbers that we can select so we have
the ability for a user to type in an
item name and how many items they want
to purchase after that they should have
a button and we can add the I on button
attributes as well as the block arrow
beads and what the block attribute does
is it makes leave often take up a
hundred percent of the width of the
screen but we will be adding padding to
our width so it won't take up the entire
screen and inside of the button so the
button text we can say add I
let's take a look at our odds shopping
list page so if we now navigate to the
ad shopping list you can see that we
have an item name and we have an item
number even on a desktop you can see
that we can only select numbers inside
of this field and because we've used the
floor thing attributes inside of our
inputs when we select the field the
level goes floating above the field
itself you can see how this locks on
various different operating systems by
heading to the platforms at the top
right and selecting more from the
drop-down list now though we've added a
template for our ad shopping page let's
create ourselves in model so now we can
accurately define an interface for our
shopping item</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
