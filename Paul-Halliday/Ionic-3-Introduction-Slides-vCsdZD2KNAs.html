adding introduction sliders to our ionic
apps let's make a new page and we'll
call our page slider this is simply in a
brand new blank project and as you can
see it's generated a new page named
slider that we can use in our app I'm
then gonna head over to my app component
TS and I'm gonna change our route page
from the home page to instead be s
string and that will say slider page
this will then take the user to the
slider instead of the home page we can
then display some slides and then after
that's finished we can navigate the user
to the home page so inside of our slider
door HTML we can remove everything
inside of this file and then we can add
back the ion content and inside of the
iron content we can add some ion -
slides the ion slides is a holder for
all of the slides inside of this
component therefore we can add an ion -
slide as many times as we want on each
slide I'm simply going to display a
welcome message such as welcome to
slider and we'll copy this three times
so let's make three ion slides each with
a h1 and some text if we save our file
you'll notice that we get welcome to
slider at the bottom of the screen we
can then slide left and right to the
other slides so underneath this I'm
going to add a paragraph tag same page
one I'm going to copy this and say page
2 and finally page 3 we can
see that we have three different slides
or pages in which we can navigate
between this allows us to provide a
simple user interface to the user when
they start using our application let's
add pager equals to true on our I on
slides as you can see this gives us the
three little pager buttons at the bottom
of our slides we could then add a little
bit of styling for example a background
color and some text color we could do
this for each one of our slides and then
when we slide through our slider you'll
notice that we get these different
colors but what about the pager as you
can see that is blue I'd like to change
them and instead we'd have it white
obviously you don't have to inline your
Styles either you can and most likely
shirts make a class for one of these but
inside of our slider door scss I want to
override the Swiper and the Swiper is
the library in which I on - slides users
and then we want to override the
pagination - bullet - active class we
can simply change the background to be
white this allows us to have a white
slider pager
so let's consider how we may
programmatically change our slides what
I'm going to do is import view child
from angular core and what this allows
us to do is access those slides and call
the next and previous methods so let's
add a new variable based on the view
child decorator will save view child
slides and slides comes from ionic
angular and our variable will be called
slides and it will be of type slides
then when the view did load so when the
view has loaded I want to call this dot
slides dot slide two and this allows us
to slide to a particular index will
slide to number two and then we have a
speed transition so we can change the
transition length in milliseconds let's
say a thousand so one second and we'll
add this as part of a set timeout so
this will happen after one second so
let's save the file and you see we start
on page one and after one second we go
to page three and that's because it's is
zero best index so if we wanted to go to
page two it would be one let's try that
again and we have a very smooth
transition that takes one second from
changing the slide to one another
I also want to add the toast controller
and the toast controller does come from
ionic and Galasso let's inject that into
the constructor and then we'll define a
new method called slider changed and
this effectively will be used to show
when the slide has changed we can say
this dot toast dot create and the
message that will display is slide
changed that will then be presented to
the user and the way that we can hook
into this method is inside of our slider
door HTML we have access to the I on
slide dead change event we can then of
course pass through our slide changed
methods
and then when our slide changes we do
get a toast at the bottom of the screen
aside from I on slide did change there
are other events that we can use such as
I on slide autoplay I on slide
autoplay start/stop even things like
drag and much more feel free to play
around with her slider as it is quite an
interesting API and you can do some
awesome experiences so that's how we use
the slider inside of ionic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
