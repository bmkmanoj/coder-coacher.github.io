at the use of tags inside of the bomber
CSS framework so let's start off by
making our first tag just to see what it
looks like inside of the browser so if
we have a spun with the class of tag and
inside of this tag will simply my first
tag as you can see here it appears
on-screen
now we can go through and add a variety
of different colors so similar to our
buttons we can also add things like as
black can add is dark is light is it
white and then we can go for more
colorful tags if we do the same but this
time we use things like is primary is
info is a success
is warning and finally is danger so here
we have a variety of different colored
tanks
we're not limited to this we can
actually change the sizes of these tags
as well so let's a look at different
sizes I'm going to take the first two
here and we're also going to add is
medium and is large so here we have our
two tags here the first one is medium is
a slightly bigger than me normal tag and
of course the is large is massively
bigger than at the normal tag we can
also append things like a delete button
so let's do that
append delete button and in order to do
that we would take our standard tag and
the only thing would need to do is
simply add a button with the class of
delete and if we save our file we can
see then our tag now has this button the
user can click it and once again we can
select a variety of different sizes we
can also add different sizes to our tags
worth button so if we made our second
tag have B button at once again but we
added is large to the tag you can see
that we now have a tag that is large but
also includes a button so that's how we
can add small tag labels inside of all
bomber CSS applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
