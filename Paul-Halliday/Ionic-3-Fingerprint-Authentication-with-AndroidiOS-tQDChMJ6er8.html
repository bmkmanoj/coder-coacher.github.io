fingerprint authentication to our ionic
applications to start with let's make in
new ionic project or integrate this one
with your current ionic project I've
done this with ionic starts fingerprints
- AI all blank after that we can add the
Cordova plugin by saying ionic plugin
adds Cordova - plugin
- fingerprint - here I or looking at - -
save to commit this to config dot XML
then we can add the ionic native wrapper
for this plug-in by saying npm install
its ionic - native / fingerprint - AI or
and then we can save this to packaged or
JSON with - - receive after that we can
open this up inside a visual studio
chords and the first thing that we have
to do is head over to up module dot es
and we can import from ionic - native
slash fingerprints ai or we can import
the fingerprint AI or and import this in
the list of providers and then going to
change our home to HTML to have a title
of fingerprint ail a button and the
button text is going to be sure
fingerprint dialog and sure to add the
own button under view to that and a
click event of your fingerprint dialogue
let's remove the nav controller and
replace that worth platform so it can
inject private platform platform we can
also import from ants ionic native /
fingerprint - AI or the fingerprint AI
or and the fingerprint options we can
inject to the fingerprint AI or by
saying privates fingerprints of type
fingerprints AI all and then we can
write to our function name sure
fingerprint dialogue so you sure the
dialogue we need to say this doll
fingerprint dot is available to check to
see whether the fingerprint is available
prior to doing this will entry of the
function is a sink will also say there
platform dot ready to enter your that
the platform is ready we'll add a width
before this and we'll also surround this
inside of a try-catch if there are any
errors or console era the era and we
will make a new variable called
available equal to the result of this
the fingerprint dot is available I'm
sure you add a wave before that and we
can get that result by seeing console
but log available I'm now going to add
the Android platform to test this on the
device so let's say ionic platform add
Android and then we can run ionic to run
Android dash L this will start in live
reload server and any changes that we
make will be updated on the device so if
we click it sure finger print dialog we
get or care and that or care comes from
the fact that the fingerprint is
available so back in our chords we can
say if available is equal to or care
then we can say this doe fingerprint dot
show and the show requires some
fingerprint options so let's now make
some fingerprint options we've imported
it here from ionic native fingerprint AI
or so let's make a new variable called
fingerprint options F type fingerprint
options and perhaps inside of all
constructor we can set these options so
let's take a look at what is inside
these fingerprint options we have a
client ID we have a client secret and it
do know that the secret is only needed
on Android and the option to disable a
backup option this one is only for
Android and optional so let's set up our
options by same the client ID is going
to be equal to at this point to
something like fingerprints
- demo the client secrets we will just
simply put C passwords and we will
disable a backup option so disable
backup true if we pass these options to
or fingerprints we can now say this dot
fingerprint sure and pass in this door
fingerprint options we can capture the
result of this by saying con stories alt
as equal to a with this door fingerprint
ID show and then we can console dot log
those results if we now click the shore
fingerprint dialog you want you all to
see this on screen because I'm using a
real device and not an emulator but it
says fingerprint authentication confirm
a fingerprint to continue if I select
cancel we do get that canceled and that
comes from our console but error here
and that's because this fingerprint dot
sha returned in error but if I click it
again and this time I confirm my
fingerprints it says fingerprint
recognized and assures the fingerprints
so that wraps up using the fingerprint
authentication with iOS and Android
within our ionic applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
