the in our browser plug-in within our
ionic projects so we can start off by
installing the Cordova plugin by seeing
ionic Cordova plug-in ads Cordova
plug-in in up browser after that we can
install the ionic native plugin by
saying npm install at ionic native /
in-app browser give you air of the
different spellings of in a browser one
has dashes and the other one doesn't
when it comes to installing the plugins
this plug-in is widely supported it
supports the following platforms Amazon
fire OS Android BlackBerry browser
Firefox OS iOS and much more so now that
we've got everything under control we've
downloaded the plugins and investigate
the platforms let's open this up inside
of our editor so the first thing to do
and this is the same for all ionic
native plugins is importer in to our
route our module so let's import in our
browser from ionic native
we can then add this to the list of
providers and after that we can head
over to our components so I'll be using
the home page component and as always
we'll be injecting that into the
constructor so let's say privates in up
browser and that is a type in up browser
and remember we can import that from
ionic native as well so everything so
far as being a standard set up for ionic
native and now we'll get to the in-app
browser specifics so for this project
I'm going to head over to home the HTML
and I'm going to change the title to be
in our browser
I'll also change the color of the navbar
to be dark and I'll start off by adding
an eye on item now the eye on item will
allow us to hold a label
level will be floating and will contain
the value of URL this will allow the
user to submit a URL in which they can
submit into an ion input the ion inputs
will have a type of URL that gives us
some keyboard specific things and I'll
also attach an NG model equal to a class
variable named URL finally we'll tread
ourselves a button and that button will
have the I on button attribute I'm going
to give it the block arrow beads and I'm
also going to give it the clear arrow
Butte that should make it take up 100%
width and of course the clear will give
it a click event
webpage and then of course will pass in
a URL to this function so the cakes for
our button will be open web page simple
enough so we can head over to our home
TS or home page and we can make our URL
of type string and then our function
open web page which takes a URL of type
string we don't have to add this as a
parameter here but it makes it more
testable and more flexible so the first
thing to do is said this door in a
browser door create and you'll notice
that this returns us an in-app browser
object as a result we can say Const
browser is equal to creating this
browser so by creating the browser we
also need to pass through a URL and that
URL comes from our parameter and then we
have two optional parameters the first
is a target now that's the target in
which to load the URL by default the
target is self but we can use blank to
simply open it inside of the inert
browser or system to open this inside of
the system browser I'm going to leave
this at self to simply open it inside of
the Cordova web view we also have the
ability to add some in-app browser
options let's import in-app browser
options
from ionic native
make ourselves some options by saying
constant options of type in app browser
options and if you wish you can of
course add some options everything from
allowing a location bar on or off to
clearing the cache session cache using
the hardware back button and much more
if we were to for example turn off the
Android zoom controls we could do that
by seeing a zoom and then of course
putting the value to nor let's pass
these options in to our in-app browser
so essentially we're opening a URL and
returning an in-app browser object now
why is it important that we know that's
an in-app browser object well that's
because we can now say browser dot and
we have the ability to do everything
from closing the browser showing the
browser hiding it and of course
executing scripts and inserting CSS
finally with the on methods we can hook
into a particular browser event and then
use subscribe to subscribe to this event
for now let's go back to simply opening
up a URL if we run this on our device by
seeing ionic Cordova run Android and I'm
going to add the - el flag for live
reloads we should be able to go ahead
and open up a URL inside of our
application so I'm going to add my blog
so that blog poll holiday denial and if
I click open web page you can now see
that our website opens up inside of our
application if I select a page I can go
through and browse as normal if I want
to I can select a different page with
the URL bar top
and also I can hit the eggs to return to
the app so that's how we can use the
inner browser to navigate to different
websites from inside of our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
