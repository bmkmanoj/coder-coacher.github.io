video we'll be looking at how we can use
fuse to create classes inside a few
studio so a class allows us to make
reusable content but Before we jump
ahead of ourselves let's make a new fuse
project using fuse create a pan I'll
call this fuse class we can then CD into
fuse class and of course we're going to
open this up inside of our editor and at
the same time fuse studio so once again
I will reiterate that if you want to use
fuse head over the fuse tools calm and
you can also get a free trial of a few
studio if you hit plans and for example
if we then hit downloads on the free
version we can see that we can get this
30-day free trial of fuse a professional
so I've opened all project up inside a
few studio now what I'm going to do at
this point is drag a rectangle onto our
application I'm going to select that
rectangle and few studio allows us to
change things such as the width height
layout and much more let's give this a
width of 150 and the heights of 150 will
then select style and parts the color to
be something like red and you certainly
can't miss of this rectangle because we
have a rectangle now in the middle of
our screen which is completely red let's
now take a circle and I'm going to add
the circle underneath the rectangle the
circle will also have the height of 150
and the width of 150 but this time our
circle is going to be blue I'm going to
place these things in a stack panel so
we'll add a stackpanel above the
rectangle we can potentially add some
padding to this as so let's first put
some item spacing of 10 and maybe some
padding of 20 from the top so at this
point we can then select one of these
items from the navbar here on the left
or alternatively hit selection and
like one of these items if we select the
rectangle and then we hit make class
from selection this gives us the ability
to add a class name I'm gonna give this
the name of red rectangle and we also
have the ability to extract this class
to its own don't you Acts file this
allows us to work with our classes much
easier so I'm going to select this
checkbox and hit create class notice now
we have this red rectangle class inside
the list of classes let's do the same
but we'll select the circle and we'll
call this my circle we'll extract this
to a new file once again and hit create
class so we now have my circle and we
now also have red rectangle these are to
adjust to random classes that we've made
but you'll notice that we can then drag
the circle or the rectangle into this
stack panel and then we get a new
instance of that class now you can
imagine that if this was in more complex
element this would then allow us to add
powerful elements to our user interface
with ease we simply can just
drag-and-drop the classes as we wish
you'll notice that what we can then do
is right-click this class and we can
either edit the red rectangle and that
allows us to potentially change this and
you'll notice that all instances of our
rectangle are changing so at any point
if we wanted to change the color of this
rectangle for example we could give this
a gradient maybe from this green to this
blue we could also give this some drop
shadow
and as we continue to add more things to
this rectangle each instance changes so
if we had a complex application with
multiple screens all of these things
would change you'll also notice that we
can drag more items onto the red
rectangle class if I drag this circle
underneath the rectangle you'll see that
this is added one with parts the width
and height of one hundreds and maybe the
color of a yellow and this allows us to
have some interesting UI elements that
are really easy to edit and create we
aren't limited to simply editing this
inside a few studio as always we can
right click this class and hits locate
in editor and you'll also find that for
example then when we come to look at the
code for this particular class it's
really clean there's nothing more than
it needs to be it's simply a rectangle
with a gradient to gradient stops and
our drop shadow and circle so that's how
we go ahead and make classes inside of
fear studio I think you'll find that
this is really powerful when it comes to
making reusable elements inside of your
fuse projects so if you haven't seen
already I do have a fuse course over at
Paul Halliday don't I or you can find a
link to this inside of the description
and as you can see here it's called
creates cross-platform native mobile
applications with fuse and this goes
through how we'd create our own fuse
applications and I'm always adding more
content to this course so if you're
interested in getting started with fuse
this is an awesome starting point thanks
a lot for watching let me know what you
want to see in the next a fuse video
inside of the comment section below do
you want me to build some applications
here on the channel are you interested
in particular needs of integrations let
me know I'll make the videos thanks a
lot see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
