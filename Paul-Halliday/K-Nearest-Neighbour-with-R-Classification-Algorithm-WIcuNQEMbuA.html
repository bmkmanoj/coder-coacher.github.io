to care near us but never within our and
our studio this is a machine learning
classification algorithm and the data
set that we're going to be used is
biopsy data on breast cancer patients
this is an assessment of 699 patients
each of the attributes and the Arab you
can see right here such as clump
thickness uniformity cell size and so on
a scored on a scale of 1 to 10 so they
are normalized and we have a
classification of either benign or
malignant so our algorithm is going to
try and determine whether the data sets
for example the test sets can correctly
classify that result so hopefully we
should be able to get a decent sized
classification and what we can do is
head over to our studio and from within
our studio we can import that biopsy dot
CSV so this will contain at that data
set its cell phone we can do that by
saying BC underscore D for breast cancer
data set can be equal to the read of the
CSV file so we can take in a biopsy dot
CSV we can ensure that we have strings
as factors equal to false as will be
make an hour on and let's have a look
firstly at the data set we have these
first two columns X and ID both of which
aren't really going to help us and
classifying whether that is benign or
malignant or what we'll do is we remove
these two columns from the data set so
see how did a search should actually
start from column three on to column at
twelve so for we print that out again we
do have from v1 onwards to v9 with our
classification at the end here let's
make a factor for that classification
so we can set the class with the levels
of combined benign and malignant should
have the level of benign and malignant
let's have a look again and now you can
see our class factor at the bottom
correctly analyzing whether something is
either benign or malignant with these
ones or twos so now that we have that
what we need to do now is make a new
dataset that doesn't include this factor
so the dataset with Korea will only have
columns 1 through 9 so we can say that
the data set that we want to use maybe
you will call it BC is equal to BC
underscored V from 1 to 9 so if we take
a look at BC we do only have 1 through 9
and now we can set aside some training
data so I'm going to set aside 583 so
that should leave us with a hundred to
test with and we can do that by making
some training data from one to five
hundred and eighty-three and including
the comma so that we include everything
as you can see we now have BC on the
score trend and if we did the same for
test for BC 5 at 4 to 6 is 3 we have a
hundreds test better and 583 training
data so now we need to match the labels
for either benign or malignant for them
training and test data sets so we can
save BC train levels and that can be
from VC underscored B because that's the
classification set from 1 to 583 and we
only want the column 10 so that's the
classification column so let's add that
let's also add the test levels from BC
underscore D from 584 to 683 column 10
so that's the classification once again
but this time for the tester set what
all set up now to start our kit nearest
but never algorithm all we have to do is
install the classification package with
our so I'm going to use install packages
and we're going to pass end class here
we can add this to the project using
library class that will allow us to use
the class methods and now we need to
create a prediction so we can set BC
test prediction and that can be equal to
the key nearest neighbor
with the training sets of BC underscore
trend the test sets of the BC underscore
test the levels of BC Tran levels and
then we need a care now it's a good idea
to hover around the square root and the
care that I'm going to use in this
scenario is around 24 so we could
approximate 24 26 around the area but
it's up to you you should try some
different values depending on the
results that we get so I'm going to
offer 24 and then what we can do now is
compare the prediction to be data set so
for that I'm going to use something
called G models or install.packages
G models and we'll add this to the
project with library gene models and
then we can make a new cross table with
the X of BC test levels so the X of our
test levels versus the Y which is our BC
test prediction and we'll also disabled
choice squared so we don't want any
contributions of chi-squared within our
cross table so if we run this we get the
results so if we look at the top left
that means there was a benign and we
correctly observed that 79 times out of
a total of 79 in the row and also for
the bottom right we correctly identify
21 of the 21 malignant tumors
so within the hundred observations of
our test sets
we accurately predicted each one of them
