difficult thing and all the time
different solutions have been available
but all of them usually require a lot of
setting up and a lot of security risks
and implementations now recently we have
something called the payment request API
and what this is intended to do is
eliminate checkout forms
we're going to be implementing this
inside of our applications today so
let's make a new directory and we'll
call out web payments and I'm gonna CD
into that I'm also going to make a FGS
and at the same time we will make an
indexed or HTML we'll open this up
inside the visual studio codes as well
as Google Chrome so inside of our
index.html and make a new HTML file and
we'll simply call this payment to
requests we'll give this a h1 just so we
aren't looking at a blank screen of also
payment requests like so we'll add a
script with the source of Abdo GS and
that will be our application dot JS file
and if we head over to Abdul GS we
should be able to start implementing
this API so our journey starts by saying
if a window don't payment request that's
essentially determining if it exists on
the user's browser else if not you want
to fall back to your other
implementation now it's really important
that you do this because if you aren't
going to use this API then you do need
to check to see whether it's currently
support on the person's device and if
it's not supports you want to fall back
to a traditional checkout methods so
then we have to start by creating a
payment request object and for that we
need to determine some support
payment methods so let's make a constant
of supported payment methods that can
simply be in new areia with one object
with these supported methods other small
end time basic - cards this will allow
us to take a basic card sort of Visa and
MasterCard anything like that but in the
future and I do recommend you check the
documentation for this you could also
add things like Android pay so it's not
necessarily stamped assembly cards you
can have your own payment provider so to
find some support payment methods we
then need to define the payment details
and this is the cost and the currency so
if we had a constant for payment details
I'm going to make a new object and we
will have a total and at this point we
can also define something like a label
so we'd have a total cost and then for
our amount we can specify a currency
such as jvp and the actual amount so
value if we had 30 we could also create
then any custom options so if we had an
options and that would be simply equal
to a blank plain JavaScript object at
this point because I don't want any
custom options and I'd be final thing to
do or one of the final things is to then
create Lee requests itself and that can
be done by saying Const payment requests
and we want to pass through in new or
rather create a new payment request and
then as the parameters we want a
supported payment methods the payment
details and any further options now that
we have access to this payment request
object we can say payment request dot
sure
so anytime we cram this new payment
request it doesn't appear on screen this
means we can use it throughout our
application with dot Shaw so once we
save this and refresh our page providing
I spell request properly if we then
refresh this once again we then at this
point have your payment the total cost
of 30-pound gvp which we could click
here for extra details in our order
summary if we wanted to we have a
payment method which we can then select
choose and create a new payment method
if we wanted to and then we'd also have
the ability to then appear if we wanted
to capture any details from the person
we could change it dot then on to the
end of our show and subsequently log out
the response the same goes for a dot
catch if there are any errors so at this
point inside of your then call you'd be
able to process the payment however you
want so you now have all the information
from the user in a standardized fashion
which you can then do as you please so
that's how we use the payment request
API and I'd love to know what you think
