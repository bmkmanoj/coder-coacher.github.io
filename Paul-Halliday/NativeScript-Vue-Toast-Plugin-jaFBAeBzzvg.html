looking at how we can use the toast
plugin inside of our native script of
view applications let's create a new
native script up by using TNS create and
I'll be calling this native script view
toast with the template of native script
- a view - template this gets us up and
running with a native script view
project and from here on out we can add
the native script toast plugin now do
beware there's nothing specific about
view with this plugin and in order to do
that we can run Tina's plug-in add
native script - toast I'll finally open
this up inside of my editor with code
dot and then I'll run this on iOS by
using Tina's run iOS if everything is
worked so far you should get a standard
native script View application and
inside of our app dot GS I'm simply
going to remove everything let's start
off by requiring view I can be done by
requiring view from native script view
and then I'm going to require toast from
a native script toast after that we can
set up in new view instance the instance
will have a template the template will
have a page will also give this an
action bar with the title of native
script toast will also have is stack
layout and we can add whatever we want
inside this snack layout but I'll be
adding it button and when we tap on the
button using the add tab
I want to call air methods named short
toast the text of our button will simply
say a short toast and from here on out
we can write the short or steth 'it's to
make it sort our application actually
boots up we can add the dollar start
function at the end of our view instance
you should now see near the script toast
with a short toast button if we select
that obviously nothing is gonna happen
at the moment because we haven't written
the Essure toast methods to write the
methods we need to declare some methods
and inside of here I'm simply going to
write in new function name short toast
and that will say toast dot make text in
here we can declare what text we want to
say I'm going to say hello
near the script view and then we can
declare a duration the duration I'm
going to give this is long notice how
that is a string and then if you want
you can also make this a variable so we
can say constant my toast is equal to
the toast methods we can then short our
toast by saying my toast
Dosher and if you wanted to you could
chain that to the end of the toast make
text function but if we save this file
you should now see that our toaster
should appear I'm gonna hit short toast
and you can see how long NATO scrubbed
view and the bottom of our screen let's
make this a little more interesting if
we added a text field let's make this a
little more interesting by adding a text
field and we'll give this the v-model of
message so of course at this moment and
time message does not exist so we'd need
to change our make text to instead be
looking for this dot message so we could
then inside of our text field say hello
and if we hit your toast
of course we would get that hello
message from the this dot message model
if you've used ng model before in
angular you should
right at home with v-model we could
declare a standard default variable
inside of our data called message and
this could be our native script view
message that we had before so now by
default our message would say hello
native script view but we could change
this to instead say something like pizza
so that's how we use the native script
toast plug-in inside of our native
script view applications I have to say I
really am a big fan of you and I'm using
it more and more in my projects so
you'll most likely same or near the
script view contents in the coming
months let me know what plugins you'd
like to see of course inside of the
comment section below and any example
applications you'd like to see over here
in the comments or over at patreon
thanks a lot for watching don't forget
