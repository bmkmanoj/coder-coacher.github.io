material a UI framework developed by
Google inside of our angular projects
and start a new project by using ng in
it or ng new and this will be called ng
material this will create all the
project files and then of course
download all of our dependencies now
that that has been successfully created
we can see D into ng material and we can
start our journey by using NPM install
at angular slash material and also the
angular CD care and that's the component
developer kit once we install these two
dependencies will then need to install
the angular animations dependency we
could install it at the same time but I
think it's a good idea to break these
things down so the next dependency is of
course angular animations and our final
dependency at this moment in time is
going to be hamaji s now you might not
need hamaji s for all of your project
but you will need a within certain
components the components such is the
slider and the slide toggle all need to
deal with native touch and hamaji s is
really good with this it allows us to
deal with gestures much easier and of
course is a dependency on angular
material so we have that let's now open
this up inside of es chords and also run
ng serve so we have a very basic
application it says welcome to up and
it's exactly what we expect I'm going to
open my source directory and inside of
app I'm going to make a shared folder
and also a core folder inside of sheds
I'm going to make a new module by saying
shed module dot ES and
start by scaffolding out in UNG module
let's import from angular slash core the
ng module will use the ng module
decorator and will export a new class
named shared module we'll come back to
that in a moment
let's start off by making our core
module just the same let's make a core
module don TS and I'm going to copy
everything from our shared module into
our core module let's change the name to
be core module instead and inside of the
core module I'm also gonna import from
at angular slash platform - browser
slash animations I need to import the
browser animations module this is a
dependency on angular material and we'll
need to add this to the list of imports
let's head over to our app module dot ES
and inside of imports underneath the
browser module we can import our core
module we can then import our shared
module and before we get too carried
away let's import hammer GS inside of
our main TS so let's import how much yes
awesome so we have our core module set
up we have our shared module and we have
of course our browser module inside of
our routes at module don TS inside of
our shared module we need to import
every single component we want to use
from angular material I want to add a
toolbar to our app so let's import the
MD toolbar module now everything starts
from of course the MD for material
design the toolbar for the name of the
component and then module 4 of course Li
module that exposes that functionality
let's import that from an angular slash
material
as we're using a shared module will also
have to export this from this module so
let's add the MD toolbar module to our
exports this will allow us to use the MD
toolbar in feature modules that imports
our shared module so because our app
module dirty-ass uses the shared module
we can head over to our component or
HTML and we can add MD - toolbar inside
of the toolbar I'm going to add a span
which is called my application and this
will be our title if we then save our
file you will notice that we do get my
application on screen but we don't have
a toolbar and that's because we haven't
added a style for our app now you can
either make your own theme or use a
numerous amount of pre-built themes with
angular material and we can do that by
heading over to styles don't see SS we
can then use add import and we can pass
in the angular material slash pre-built
- themes and I'm going to use the
integral - pink dot CSS when I save the
file you can now see that we have a tool
bar this may be hard to see because at
the moment it's currently got a gray
background let's head over to our I've
component the HTML and give the toolbar
a color of primary when we do that our
toolbar goes blue we still of course
have some padding or margin around our
application toolbar inside of our Styles
don't a CSS I'm going to reset the
margin to be zero pixels on our
application by doing that you can see
that we then have a toolbar inside of
our application that's built with
angular material we've done things like
add a style is shared module a core
module and more from here on out if we
want to add any other component to our
material application
all we need to do is head back over to
our shared module and adds the
appropriate module don't forget to
export the module and then of course we
can use it in any component that imports
our shared module so that's how we get
up and running with an angular CLI
project and material design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
