I'd like to welcome you to my latest
course near the script with ng RX before
we enter that let's talk at low bar
where it's published and that is native
scripting calm medda scripting calm is
in net a script of specific training
sites created by unlike siskins
native scripting offers a variety of
content everything from free native
script angular content to standard free
native script content and of course
tiered bundles and standards singular
courses
I recommend that you at least jump in
for the free content as there is a
variety of free content you can access
things like learning the major script
basics creating user interfaces
application logic and much more
my course native script with ng Rx is
published on this length and it's a
beginner's luck at ng rx store and
controlling side effects with ng rx
effects
so we look at everything from state
management to defining and dispatching
actions also look at things like
interacting with third party API s with
HTTP and of course things like smart and
presentational components and much more
the core theme throughout this whole
project is to build a simple application
but more important than that
is to give you a framework going
forwards to implementing state
management's in your native script
angular applications so I've gone ahead
and place their link to this course
inside of the description but I do
recommend that you check out all the
other content here on native scripting
calm as well so thanks a lot for
watching don't forget to check out my
new course near to squirt with ng rx and
of course native scripting calm until
next time my name is Paul Halliday and
I'll see you very soon in at the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
