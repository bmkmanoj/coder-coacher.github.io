deep linking within our applications so
I made a new ionic project named ionic
page so if we CD into ionic page and run
this in the browser with ionic serve you
can see we have a standard blank ionic
application so let's remove the homepage
and instead replace that with a Post's
Page
I'll also be creating a post detail page
and what I want to do is less be posts
in the post page have a post details
page which would represent a URL
structure like posts slash detail /i d
so idk be 1 2 3 4 and we could navigate
to that URL and it would fetch the
appropriate post so let's start off by
removing that home page because we'll be
creating our own posts page and we'll be
lazy loading that so we'll need to get
rid of that so I've deleted the home
page we can remove this from app module
removing from the declarations and the
entry components also need to remove it
from the app component PS and instead
supply in new route page so if we run
ionic generates page posts that should
generate a new page name the posts page
if we take a look we can see that we
have exports class posts page so that
would be the class that we will navigate
to when lazy loading so we can say that
our route page is now is string equal to
posts page that's all we need to do we
don't need to add it to the app module
or anything like that so here we have
what we have posts now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to change the color of
the nav bar to primary and I'm also
going to generate a provider now this
provider will go to a web service it
will get some place all the data and we
will display this in the application so
let's generate a providing our ionic
generates provider data and this will be
the data provider because we
generated with the ionic CLI it's
automatically added to our app module
and added it to the providers array like
so so all we need to do now is write a
function so that function is going to be
called get posts and we can say this -
HTTP GET and now we need to get a URL so
the REST API that we're going to be
using is JSON a place holder so we can
find this at the URL of JSON plus order
dot type a cord calm so let's take that
add that to a root URL object like so so
we have now a string named root URL and
we can say this like HTTP don't get and
we can pass in a true URL we'll have to
do is slash because we want to do slash
posts so good even if we wanted to set
posts like silk so then would be able to
say slash toast so this would get the
posts from the web service we could then
that muffed that to only return the JSON
so they get their response to JSON and
also I just want to take one so we'll
add the take operator from rxjs add
operator take and we can say take one
this will completely observable after
pushing that response so now we can go
back over to our posts page but before
we do that actually we'll need to head
back to up module 30s and as we're using
HTTP we'll have to import the HTTP
module from angular slash HTTP so once
we've done that added it to the imports
inside of our engine module we can
continue so back over a post so TS we
would have a function like get posts and
that would simply give us a list of
posts so in order to categorize our list
of posts I'm going to make M model so
inside of the models folder we'll have a
post go interface TS and we can export
an interface name post and in this post
interface we know that each post will
have a user ID associated with that and
if we take a look at the structure of
the object it's a user ID which is in
number and ID which is a number a title
which is a string and a body which is a
string so we can say user ID number ID
number title string and body string we
can now see that our posts should be an
observable of posts so I'll post array
should be an observable array of cost
like so so inside of our posts page you
will need to import observable and post
we can do that by importing from rxjs
slash observable observable and it will
also need to import from models slash
posts
interface I'm going to rename that to
post die in defense like so and we can
import that
and we can then import our data provider
so we can see a private data data
provider and to use the data provider we
will have to import from providers slash
data / dat AR and thence their data
provider so now we can use that inside
of our post component and we can set
this dot data dot get posts and we can
put the result of that to our posts
object inside of our posts page then we
could do an eye on cards an eye on card
header inside of the header we'd have a
title the title would be the post title
so post a title inside of the eye on
card contents to perhaps have a
paragraph tag saying post doctor body
and for completeness we can also add the
paws to door user ID if we wanted to we
could also add the post ID so we know
the post ID as well as the post title
and then finally we can wrap this up
with an NG for saying let post of costs
and make sure that we pipe this to an
ear sink because it's an observable now
if we take a look inside of our
application we forgot to add a return
here so we need to say return at this
store HTTP don't get inside of our data
provider and finally we need to call our
this get post so we'll add this to the
constructor and simply say this don't
get posts inside of our post page
constructor so when we load our
application now we have a title and we
also have some information about that
post
it should be good enough now to generate
that posted detail page so we can say
generate page post at detail and we can
make a function inside of our post page
and navigates to detail with a post ID
and we know a post ID is a number so we
can say this got nav controlled push we
can pass in at the post of detail page
because if we take a look it I'll pause
detailed LTS back to the name of the
class and we can also pass along the
post ID so if we then when the view is
about to load pick up the post ID so
let's make it variable and then post ID
of type number and we can say this but
post ID is equal to this now params get
post ID we should be able to therefore
blog out the post ID finally if we make
it so when we click one of these cards
begin to navigate to detailed class then
that be poor student ID
so whatever card we are going to pass in
that particular ID and if we take a look
now inside of the application if we
click one of these cards we do get one
and that's because that's the ID so we
go further down we get five and so on
now this is really good but you notice
that our URL bar doesn't reflect this at
all we have the post ID and it's been
passed along as another parameter but
our URL bar doesn't reflect this it
still says localhost / post detail so
what I'm going to do is we're going to
add something called this segment now
the segment for our post page is posts
but we could change that see for example
post at list just for demonstration
purposes and we can do that by adding
the object inside this eye on page and
saying segment post list and now you can
see that our URL bar reflects that so we
have localhost / post list let's for the
bucket of posts for now do
so you can get an idea of how to change
these segments and inside of old pause
beta we can add a segment here and this
one will be paused slash paused ID and
that will reflect the post ID that we've
selected so if we save this and I'll
click one of the cards such as number
two our URL bar now reflects posts two
which is good let's now get a post when
this page loads so we're going to head
back over to our data service and I'm
going to say get paused by ID and what
if the ID is going to be a number well
then it returned a HTTP call which goes
to the root URL like before this button
root URL slash the post URL so this dot
post slash and then the ID that we want
to get the post for we can do the same
here we can map this and we can return
the JSON response and only take one
response so inside of the post detail we
could then say this dot data and we'd
have to import data service so let's do
the same we can say private data get a
provider import this at the top and we
could say this dot data don't get paused
by ID pass in the post ID and we could
do the same by saying post is of type
post we would need to import post from
old models for imports from models /
pause but in averse and then just for
quickness sake I'm going to copy the
ioniq card from the post page and add it
to the details page and instead of
saying ng for and having this click
event
can this fear post async so we'll make
sure that the post is piped with async
because it's an observable but also add
the question mark after this because
it's not going to exist the second that
we go into the page and then we'll say
dot ID title and so on so let's do that
for all of our properties I'm also going
to change the navbar color to primary
once again and we could even change the
title to be the post ID again so simply
just ID obviously we'll need to surround
that with air binding and if we go to
the post page and we now have that
detailed view so let's see if we go to
posts three we get the detailed view
four three and so on
so we've now implemented a deep link
inside of our application but we can go
a little bit further than this and we
can add the posts page as a default
history of the post detail page let's
take a look at that but if we take a
look then inside of the browser we get
invalid link posts and that's because
it's not necessarily reflective of this
segment it's actually reflective of this
name so the name could be this posts
page here or an in that we set ourselves
so we could set posts and you'll notice
that if we go to post / 4 we now have
the default history if we click back to
being that post page but if we remove
the name and save that we could just add
the default history to be the coarsest
page so if we navigate to posts / 1 we
get the same result which allows us to
you're back to the post page so in this
video we've created a new ionic 3
application we've looked at using your
provider to get data from the HTTP
service we've also looked at adding gear
interface named post as well as a
variety of ionic page specific stuff
like segments default history name and
so on
this allows us to deep link to
particular parts of our application and
make it especially more usable as we
start to deploy our ionic applications
as a progressive web app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
