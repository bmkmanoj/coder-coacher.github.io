setting up Kendall UI for angular so if
you've used angular before you may have
seen some UI packages such as material
to prime ng and of course Kendall let's
get set up with a new project generated
by the angular CLI if you haven't got
the angular CLI installed you can check
out a video on the description for
setting that up and getting started with
angular components so we're going to hit
get started on this candle UI guide and
the first thing that we'll have to do is
register for a trial so if we hit
register for a trial and I will of
course probably link for this in the
description it'll take us through this
page to sign in and register for an
account when you've done that we can go
back here and now we'll have to set up
our project so the first thing is to
install the angular CLI I've already
done that but if you haven't head over
to your command line and run NPM install
gas G at angular
slash Co I this will install the angular
CLI and we'll be able to continue
creating a new project so now we have to
make a new angular project so we can do
that by saying ng new and I'm going to
call my project Kendall and the reason
why we have to set our style equal to SC
SS is because Kendall uses s CSS for
bear projects so by saying - - style is
equal to F CSS whole project will be
generated with all s CSS of spell sheets
instead of CSS so let's hit enter on
this you'll notice that it creates a new
angular project and download three
dependencies from NPM right now this is
the same for any angular project and
we've done no Kendall specific stuff at
this time so now that marks created we
can see D into Kendall our new project
that we created and what we have to do
now is authenticate with the progress
NPM registry so if we take a look before
we do anything in the command line
that's the progress NPM registry access
we see that we have these components
down the side so if we wanted to install
the button component from this registry
we would have to make sure that we're
scoping ourselves to progress because
the button
held at our progress / and then the name
of the component such as button you can
see this and side of the button overview
for example it's our progress / Kendall
- angular - buttons so let's do that by
heading over to our command line and
authenticating ourselves with that
registry we can see NPM login - -
registry is equal to and then we need to
copy this here which is the registry NPM
Telecom so HTTP registry NPM Telecom and
within that registry we have to score
ourselves to the art of progress
packages so we can say - - scope is
equal to at progress when you've done
that you'll have to log in with the
account that you created over at the
telluric site I've already done that so
let's skip down to the next section
which is adding a Kendall UI package so
be Kendall UI components do use angular
animations and this is a package that
was part of angular core inside of
angular 2 point X but it's no longer
part of angular core after angular 4
point X so what we have to do at this
point is install the angular animations
package as well as any other Kendall UI
packages that we want to use so I'm
going to run NPM install we're going to
say - - save to save this - package.json
will install the Kendall angular buttons
package we'll also install the
localization package and finally the
animations package we can hit enter and
save this to our project if we then open
our project up inside of Visual Studio
chords the first thing that we have to
do is head over to our app module 30s
and we have to import the following
things firstly imports the browser
animation module from angular / platform
browser / animations and secondly we
have to import from the progress /
Kandor angular buttons package deep
buttons module we can add both of these
imports through our routes ng module by
saying
animations module and feed button this
module this will allow us to use both
the buttons and browser animations
within our project so I'm going to
simply add up to app component dot HTML
so now I'm going to remove the title
inside of our components and now other
button is standard so we don't have to
import any customer button elements but
the only thing that we do have to add to
this button is the Kindle button
attribute so when we've done that that
will transform our button to be of the
kendo UI styling let's add some text for
our button right now sorcerer a candle
UI button if we then run this in the
browser by saying ng serve and I'm going
to add - all to the end of this this
should open up inside of Chrome we now
have our albeit very zoomed in button at
the moment it looks just the same as a
normal button and this is because we
need to import the style sheet for our
button this is stored in a separate
package so if we head back over to our
command line we can say npm install at
progress slash Kendall - theme - default
we'll also don't need to save this to
our package dot JSON so that's it - -
save and click enter we can then import
the style sheet that we just installed
to the project inside of all global
Styles scss we can do that by seeing us
import and then we can pass any path of
our progress slash Kendall - theme -
defaults - SCSS - all so if we now lock
in our button inside of our project we
do have in nicely styled button we can
give this the primary theme color if we
then go back to our button and add the
primary attribute equal to true now our
button turns into this orange red color
with white text I hope you found this
introduction to Kendall UI useful and
it's going to set the stage for many
other Kendall UI videos to come
if you've liked this don't forget to hit
that subscribe button and check out the
new learn ionic 3 course if you're in
transferred in cross-platform mobile
developments I do have a link and
discount code for that inside of the
description that you can check out right
now until then my name is Paul Halliday
and I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
