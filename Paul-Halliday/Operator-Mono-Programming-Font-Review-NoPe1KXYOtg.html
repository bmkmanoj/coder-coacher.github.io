known as operator mano and this is going
to spawn off a different series on the
channel well we like at different
cording fonts and how we can improve our
IDE
experience so operator model starts at
about one hundred and ninety nine
dollars per license and it's up to you
for a long time I didn't really want to
spend that type of money on a font but I
thought I'd give it a shot and see
whether it's worth the money and whether
it actually improves my experience
writing chords on a day to day basis
because I think it's easy to take fonts
for granted as developers we spent the
majority of our there looking at text
but with the complexity of our cords and
sometimes in the complexity of setting
up your IDE it's easy to overlook so
like I said this one is called operator
model and already on screen you can see
some distinctions from other fonts the
great thing with operator is that
whenever we have an attribute that is
italicized so we get this specific
italics font and as you can see it has a
funky ass here and other things like if
we added an art it looks completely
distinctive but also allows us to say
that we want to inject this variable
here named shake of type shake but we
can make a distinction between these two
words this is also done on things like
this so any time that we have this dots
we can focus on what's important and we
can look down ethical answers straight
away to see that everything with this
dot is italicized you may find the
interesting you may find a gimmick but I
like it and I do think that it makes a
big difference to readability when we're
spending you know 9 10 12 hours a day
looking at a screen
another example here if I was to type I
L and one you can distinctly see the
different characters
and that's because the character here
what the L has this complete italicized
L and it's easier to make that
distinction another thing that I like
about operator is depressors it's really
distinctive and it allows us to see at a
glance where our presses are for each
function the same goes for the brackets
there has been a lot of care and
attention gone to ensuring that they are
readable when there is a substantial
amount of them on screen so overall I do
really like this font while it is quite
expensive and I certainly wouldn't
recommend it to everyone it's a decent
premium font and you can tell that a lot
of care and attention has gone into
making its aesthetic readable and usable
on a day to day basis what do you think
let me know in the comment section below
what fund you use and whether you think
paid to nodosa font is way too much and
how much you would pay for a font if
none at all thanks for watching don't
forget hit that subscribe button to stay
updated and of course let's check out
some more fonts in the near future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
