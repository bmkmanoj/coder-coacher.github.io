at creating partial files we're going to
take this header and we're going to move
the entrance on file that can be done by
creating a new folder inside of our
theme folder and that will be called
partials this is for any partial amount
of contents or templates such as this
header let's create a file then inside
of here called header don't HBS we can
then pull out this cords by using
command X or ctrl X and then inside of
handed or HBS we can use command V or
control V to test this inside of this
file but save indexed or HBS and when we
refresh our page you'll notice that we
lose that header if we then head back
over to our default or HBS we can stick
in our header by using the greater than
sign and then the name of our partial
while our partial is called header so
we'll type header if we save the file
and refresh you'll notice that we get
the error the partial Herer
could not be found so why could header
not be found we've created here inside
of the partials folder well the answer
to that is that we have to restart our
ghost server now we didn't have to
restart this server when we created
default HBS and that's because ghost was
expecting that file to be there but when
we create a partial like ghost does not
know about already such as the header
door HBS we have to restart our ghost to
server so let's run ghost stop and then
we'll run ghost start development once
again
if we refresh our file we then get our
header like we did before but this time
it's in its own file which we could then
navigate and change we could add
anything we want here if we add a
paragraph such as hello world underneath
the description our changes would be
reflected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
