this is essentially a functional
reactive programming library let's
install bacon into our projects with NPM
install bacon GS after that I'm using an
old environment and I am going to say
Const bacon is equal to require bacon G
s we're going to start off by
considering how we may start a timer or
an interval inside of JavaScript so if
we had a timer we might do something
like set interval we'd have an anonymous
function and for that function we might
say console the log hello world and we
can do that every one second so then if
we run our project and we said Nord
indexed or Jess we would say hello world
every second
the same could be done if we wanted to
for example make a new debt we could
console dot log that and we would get
the current debt every second let's do
this with bacon and bacon allows us to
do something called dot interval this
essentially allows us to have an
observable that repeats every interval
number
so we'll use a thousand milliseconds and
then we will use map so we'll take this
interval and we'll map this to it new
debt and then in order to get the value
of the observable so in order to
subscribe to the observable we need to
again to the on value method that gives
us our debt in which we can console dot
log the debt or alternatively we can
just simply add console.log and the
parameter will be passed to our log
function I'm going to comment out our
initial set interval and if we run Nord
index dot chance again you can see that
we get the debt every second
if we wanted to for example only take a
certain amount of items from this a
bacon interval would usually take
operator we could also use take until
but if we said tick and then we said 10
we could run our project once again and
what we would find is that we get the
dead logged out to the console every one
second until we have ten iterations
after the ten iterations it will
complete as you can see we no longer
have that dare being logged out to the
console
we could do a similar thing with
sequentially so let's comment out our
interval for now and we'll move this
down and we will see sequentially we can
then say bacon dot sequentially and what
this does is it allows us to define an
interval so we will say for example 500
milliseconds and then we can pass in an
array of values
so let's add a random set of numbers to
our array and if we hook into our on
value method once again
and we log this on to the console you
can see that we get this sequential
amount of results so first we get five
then 99 at 35 and so on so an awesome
thing about using sequentially is that
we can add all of these numbers we can
use dot scan and what scan does is
allows us to accumulate each number each
time we have an observable value we can
start our seed at zero
and then our accumulator function will
simply take air and be and return a plus
B let's log this out to the console as
you can see we started off with zero
then we ended with 5 104 139 and so on
so scan is really good when you want to
deal with sequential values that we add
up over a period of time
if you want to add the previous value so
you want to create an accumulator from
either your sequential observable or
your interval then scan is a really good
function we can also like and things
like bacon dot combine with and this
allows us to define a function that
returns us a given value for example if
we had a and B once again and we wanted
our function to simply return us the ear
plus B we could then add the values of
10 and 20 and when we subscribe to this
width on value we should get 30 as you
can see we do get 30 there but we could
change this now to instead of being a
plus we can make that a multiple and now
we get 200 so this allows us to combine
is set and of course define the function
that is used to combine the items we can
also create observables from events for
example if I had a bacon and I use the
dot from events
I could pass through and eventtarget
this could be things like a hedge tml
element so if we for example had a
reference and that was equal to
something like a document dot query
selector and we passed then a potential
ID such as profile image now that's not
gonna work because the document doesn't
exist here on my environment but we
could pass it in as a reference and
maybe we want to listen to the click
event on that event we could then
capture the on value and do whatever you
want when the console dot log that out
and we'd have access to that event as an
observable stream so bacon is really
powerful when you want to use functional
reactive programming and of course goes
much deeper than this this is a slight
overview to get you started with bacon
and of course using a lot of the
operators I'd love to know what you
think in the comment section below about
bacon do you think it compares to our ex
Jess are you gonna use this inside of
your projects and of course don't forget
to check out Paul holiday don't I all we
have lots of courses there we have node
free content with ionic and firebase and
until next time thanks a lot for
watching I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
