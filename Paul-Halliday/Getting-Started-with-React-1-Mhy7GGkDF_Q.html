old first react application I'm going to
start a series here on the channel
involving a react it's another popular
library like Angela if you've never seen
it before and just like angular it has
some nuances when you're looking to get
started with react we can use the create
react app package to create a react
application that's pre-configured with
web pack and everything else we need to
get started making a react app so let's
install that providing you've got Nords
jess installed and then run npm install
create dash react dash up dash G
when you've done that we can run create
data react dash app once again but this
time we need to pass earful the name
after which so I'm going to put a
project name at the moment which will be
first up
sort of make use of the create react app
but we can say creates react up and then
in name / folder so my folder is going
to be called hello dash world this is
going to install react to react DOM and
Rihanna scripts and set up everything we
need to get started if everything went
successfully you should have this
success message and we can then CD which
is change directory into that folder so
CD hello dash world I'm going to then
open up the project inside a vs code so
when we open up the project and look at
this file structure for the first time
we have something called the node
modules and if you're already familiar
with the Nord modules you'll know that
that's the dependencies for this project
if we install any dependencies with NPM
it will be put inside of North modules
will also be able to see the saved
dependencies inside of our package JSON
and at the moment you can see it's react
and react Dom our dev dependencies are
reactive scripts and this is what allows
us to run the project build the server
tester and so on next we have the public
folder and that contains our index
2.html with the div ID of routes and
we'll be putting everything inside of
the route ID at this moment in time
we'll take a look at this in a bit more
detail so if we take a look at the react
Dom render we can see that we're
rendering a react component into the
dome what this does is it renders the
app component into the roots container
so we can find the real concern here in
the index 2.html so our app component
gets rendered inside of this bibs so
what is the app component he asked it's
inside of our co je s so if we make a
new component within react we see that
we have a class named app and it extends
the components that were importing here
from react inside of fgs we're creating
in new class named up and we're
extending the react component module now
inside of our up components we're
rendering the following HTML now there's
a few intricacies when it comes to
rendering HTML inside of our react
components and if we look at the first
example you might see this class name
equals app we also have class name
equals app header up intro and so on
this is because otherwise we would have
class here and class here so we have to
use class miam which then it gets
converted to class inside about HTML but
also exporting the app module here and
let's run it in the browser to see how
it all works
inside of our terminal one we created
the react application we've not told
about the npm start npm run build npm
test and the npm run eject commands i
definitely would recommend you don't run
npm run eject at this point but we can
run npm start this creates in new
development server and allows us to look
at what the app looks like at this
moment in time so let's run npm to start
this is the same as something like ng
serve with angular ionic serve with
ionic and the list goes on so from here
if we make any changes inside of our
cord it gets updated inside of our app
so let's change welcome to react to
instead sphere subscribe for more react
videos and save that file instantly it
gets updated inside of our view and we
get some different text on the screen in
the coming videos we'll look at more
react concepts as well as react native
so if you'd like to see more react at
let me know in the comment section below
and until then hit that subscribe button
for more videos my name's Paul and I'll
see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
