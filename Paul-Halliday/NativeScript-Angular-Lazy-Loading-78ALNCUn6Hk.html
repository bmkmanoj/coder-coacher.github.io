application here on the native script
side and we have a modules folder that
contains both a login and a profile
module you can imagine that perhaps
you're logging in to a particular app
and then you're able to set up a profile
afterwards and in this video I want to
look at how we can add routing to our
application but more importantly how we
can add lazy loading to that routing
because at this point we could define
that these components in line here
inside of the app routing module but
what we'd find is that as our
application got bigger the startup time
for our application would also get
longer this is not what we want in a
production app and what we want to do is
instead split up our applications into
particular modules and only lord those
modules when necessary so we can do that
by first off defining our app routing
module and this allows us to simply
define the routes for routes using the
native script ranter module and
providing them like so I'm simply
telling angular to redirect the user to
slash login when the application Lords
this path of login then Lords the
children for this particular module now
what this does is it looks inside of
this module for any routes so we head
over to our login routing module which
we've created inside of this modules
slash login and you can see that we have
is similar set up now for the login
route itself we want to lure down login
components for passing this down the
near descriptor outer module for child
like so so this allows us to add this to
our login module and gives us the
ability to lazy lord our projects but
you'll notice that when we do this it
doesn't actually work and that's because
we need to head back over to our app
module and instead add a provider which
provides the ng module factory loader
but instead uses the native script
module factory loader and that comes
from the native script angular slash
router and also from angular core so by
doing that it allows us to add lazy
loading to our
projects once we then select a button
like this using the Radha extensions to
navigate you should find that you'll be
able to navigate between the different
pages using lazy loading so this video
evidently is a bit more advanced as it
does make some assumptions about your
routing knowledge but just know that we
need to provide this ng module Factory
Laura inside of our art module and at
the same time when you're defining
different routes inside of your app you
want to use Lorde children Lord that
particular module and show that you then
have a hashtag with the name of the
module itself so that's the class name
inside of your login module or the
module that you're trying too lazy Lords
simply then define all the different
paths and usually near the script router
module for child to pass this to the
actual routing inside of our app so if
you're looking to use lazy loading
inside of your native script angular
applications I hope this has helped let
me know what you think inside of the
