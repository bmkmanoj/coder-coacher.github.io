and the angular - CL I don't JSON if we
take a look at this file we can scroll
down and see the configuration options
that we can pass throughout our project
for example we have things like the
project name which we could change to my
awesome angular project we can tell the
CLI where the roots of our project is
that happens to be the source file are
the things like the output directory for
the build results inside of out
directory things like the list of our
application assets as well as where our
index.html start file is the main entry
point files such as mint or TS and much
more the great thing about the angular
CLI is that it gives us a lot of
customisation and helps with a bulk of
our workload this is one of the powers
of using angular as your main framework
inside of your applications at this
moment in time you don't have to worry
about configuring this angular CLI JSON
as there's nothing that we need to
change but if we made a project without
the CLI and we did it manually we would
have to do all of this ourselves
we'd have to sell webpack we'd have to
sell tests typescript and much more so
by simply using the CLI to create an
angular project we are saving hours if
not days of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
