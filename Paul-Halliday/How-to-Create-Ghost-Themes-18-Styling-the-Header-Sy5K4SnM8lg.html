handlebars lense stylus to make it look
a little different so we're gonna be
using Bomar to stylus and at this moment
in time we are instead going to remove
this h1 and h2 we'll be adding a back in
a moment but instead we'll be giving our
header the class of hero and is primary
here or allows us to have a large header
section and it can be used in other
areas than the header but you will see
this in a second when we add both a hero
head and a hero body so if we add a div
with the class of hero heads and the
class of hero body once we save our file
and refresh you can see that we now have
this sort of green at the top with
bummer we can change things up and we
can use things like is info to use this
blue color we have is warning for a
yellow color and a variety of others
let's stick to is primary for now and we
could of course change this if we wanted
to but inside of our header I want to
add in navbar so that can be done within
of and I'll give it the class of nav bar
and also is primary once we save this
you'll see that this gets a little
larger because now it's adding in nav
bar as well as this hero element inside
of our nav bar we'll have a div with the
class of nav bar menu later in the
course we'll come to looking at
navigation and adding some navigation
items to this menu but for now I simply
want to add an a tag so on anchor with
the class of nav bar item
and we'll add some text to this or item
and we use a dollar and outside of our
squiggly braces we'll use an asterisk
and we'll add four items so what I'm
using here is I'm using some are called
Emmet I have a video on my youtube
channel about Emmet you should check it
out if you haven't already and what this
allows you to do is really condense the
HTML that we write and allow us to be
much more expressive so it doesn't
really matter what we hate to wrap these
things to so we simply are going to put
a slash and each one of them
now that we've added our navbar items if
we refresh our page when we have this
small nothing happens so we need to
expand this out and you will see that we
have item 1 through 2 item 4 so how do
we come to changing this so we can view
these menu items on a mobile device or a
smaller screen as you and I say and this
can be done by adding in nav bar burger
so let's add a div on top of the nav bar
menu with the class of nav bar - burger
will add three spoons inside of this and
when we save our file we should then
have a nav bar burger but what I want to
do is add a container around all of
these things and this will just
constrain the size of the nav bar burger
as well as sorting out our current
positioning issues so if we move both
the burger and the menu inside of this
container and we refresh our page we
should then see that we have our nav bar
burger I'm quite zoomed in so it does
look a bit strange when we are zoomed in
so don't worry about that it's just
because I'm zoomed in to two hundred
three hundred percent but on your screen
at shut lock sound so we now have a
burger we now have in a bar menu but how
do we link these things together well
before we look about in detail what I
want to do is add back the nav bar title
and that's gonna be done inside of the
hero body so once again we can add a
container inside of the container I want
to add a hatch one with the class of
title
a ch2 with the class of subtitle so
inside of our h1 and Rh - we need to
part the blog title and the blog
description do you remember how we did
that if you do slots it in now but if
not we're gonna do it in a second and
that's done with two braces and a blog
title and a blog don't description so
once we save this we can then see that
we have our blog title and we also have
a description for our blog at this
moment in time I'm happy with our
implementation but we need to get this
navbar menu working this will require
some JavaScript but I don't want to just
punch out a script in here what I want
to do is add a build step with things
like web pack and Babel this will allow
us to write consistent JavaScript across
the board if we need to add other things
and it's something we'll look at in
future modules so for now don't worry
about the fact that our navbar burger
doesn't work it will in the future so
that's our header we'll come back to
customizing this in future lectures
let's move on to the body and other
content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
