tossed with in ionic on screen you can
see ionic on three different platforms
the Android iOS and Windows platform
let's head over to a blank project and
inside of our home page I'm going to
change the title to toast and we will
have firstly a button that says a short
orsk with the click event of Shore toast
so if we write this event inside of our
home page inside of here we'd have to
call the toast controller and the shore
method so we have to import to the
course controller from ionic angular and
inject this inside of our constructor so
private toast toast controller we then
have access to this toaster element so
we can say this toast dot either config
or create so now let's simply say create
and the create needs of some toast
options so let's import the toast
options just to see what's inside we
could make a new variable named toast
options at type toast options and let's
take a look at what we can set within
our toast so we can do things like a
message at a particular CSS class a
duration cause button and so on let's
use a few of these inside of our project
so in the constructor here or wherever
you like we can say this tour toast
options is equal to and then provide
some toast options we could say message
and provide a particular message such as
ionic is awesome we can add a duration
such as 3000 then that would be 3
seconds and then if we pass these toast
options into our create method such as
this dot toast options we're then
creating a toast so let's save this and
if we add the I on button argue to our
button we should now be able to collect
your toast but our toast doesn't appear
and that's because we need to show the
talk so we might have created the toast
but now we need to short so let's say
Const to
cost is equal to this toaster create and
then we can say toast don't present you
could also if you wanted to remove this
contour stirs equal to this new toast
and simply add d dot present on the end
of this motion so there's a couple of
ways in which you can do this it just
depends on how much you need to interact
with this toast if we then click short
aust we get toasty run Android it tolls
here on iOS and a toast here on windows
because ionic changes the style
depending on the operating system you
can see that it acts differently each
time if we take a look again you see we
have three different implementations but
all the same underlying code base which
is really nice let's say we wanted to
have an eye on item and inside of an
item would be a label and an input the
ng-model from within the input would be
cost message and the label would say
message and this label would be floating
and we can say that the toast message is
a string we can set our toast options of
differently we can say the message is
equal to this the toast message and the
duration is still three seconds and if
we click again this time we'll type
something in here like hello world but
when we click our toss
it doesn't appear and that's because we
have to change the way that we have this
setup so you need an ugly toast options
into the shore toast and if we do that
and then type in hello world once again
our toast then appears here at the
bottom but what if we don't want a
duration on the toast maybe we want to
keep the toast until somebody clicks a
button but we can do that too let's
remove the duration of 3,000 and instead
we can say sure cause bun equal to true
and if we just save this as is and we
type something in the box such as hello
world once again you see that we now
have this toast at the bottom of the
screen but it doesn't go it stays there
until we click the close button and what
we collect the close button the toast is
removed we can change the text to that
by saying because button
text is equal to and I'm going to put
the button to Klaus talks instead so
instead of saying cause it now should
say Klaus toast and if we click be toast
again we have that message of pork and
the close button text of Klaus toast
this is updated on all of the platforms
we also have something called a position
and from within here we can specify
either top bottom or middle let's have
like a top so now if we add something to
our toast I'll toast appears our the top
of the page let's have a like in middle
could try it once again I'll toast
appears in the middle of the screen and
finally the default is of course bottom
so that about wraps up using toasts
inside of ionic 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
