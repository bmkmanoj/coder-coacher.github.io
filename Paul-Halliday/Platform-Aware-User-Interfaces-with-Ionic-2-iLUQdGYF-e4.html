Android iOS Windows Phone and the like
have the wrong design guidelines so an
example here would be Android material
design for android iOS human interface
guidelines for iOS and be universal
Windows platform applications sort of
design guidelines for windows form now
that's really good because it means that
every Android up usually has a button
that looks like this when you click a
nice little ripple effect happens and so
on but the thing is what if you develop
in and out for three platforms let's say
we're developing that fur which is
currently Android on screen but now we
also want to go to the iphone and make
it an iphone app where we can with ionic
it automatically changes the UI so a
look like an iPhone alternatively we
could look at Windows Phone and we can
see now this is what it looks like on
Windows Phone now the thing is what if
you don't want to show off a button on
Windows Phone on what if you do want to
show file button on Windows Phone but
none necessarily iOS well this is where
the power if the platform service comes
in an ionic 2 so create a new project
open your project and we can import
platform from ionic angular we can get a
reference of it within the controller
constructor sorry and we can see from a
platform platform we can then go to our
view and we can say to our button or
whatever object it could be a div it
could be an image we can say their
energy if and we'll say a platform so is
iOS this button will now only show on
iOS it won't show on windows it won't
show on Android or any other platform
only on iOS I'll give you an example of
this right now when it eventually loads
so he can see on Windows Phone we no
longer have the button but we look at
our HTML it does exist so if we go to
iOS Android
fresh we can see that the button appears
now this functionality can also be done
in the JavaScript tube so if we had a
function called alert and let's make a
toast actually so a shirt off and if we
went to make a toast controller from
ionic angular and we instantiate here's
a toast and then we basically said it's
like tools to create the message will be
I am on Android and that will last for
three seconds to stop present so we're
basically going to say in our
constructor here or in fact we'll use
ionic viewdidload to only sure if the
platform is Android you do need an if
statement before that but yeah so if the
platform is Android then we can assure
the toss but on this toast will appear
I'm on Android like so so if we open up
our up we need to save it first so if we
open up our app and it builds we should
not get a toast right now feat notice at
all there then if we switch to android
we get tossed which is i am one android
so hopefully you can see the power of
the platform service in macon contextual
you is based on whatever platform you're
on you'd like to see more content like
this then hit that subscribe button and
check out learn ionic to calm i'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
