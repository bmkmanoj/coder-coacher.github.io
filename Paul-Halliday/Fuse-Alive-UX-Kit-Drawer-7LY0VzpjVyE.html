at the alive UX kit within the
professional version of fuse fuse have
given us a professional version to play
around with so let's have a like it at
the alive draw now alive is the name of
the professional UX kit that comes along
with the fuse Pro and the draw is
actually quite neat I want to show you
this because when we click the draw it's
a different roar than you'll see in the
majority of your applications let's
start off by writing the draw so we have
a live draw and in order to use the
alive namespace we have to run oonagh
install fuse charting and you know
install fuse UX kits alive then inside
of a live draw in your project we have
to have both added the charting and the
alive UX kit to our packages we then
have access to this alive UX kit and
from within here we can add the draw so
inside of the draw
I'm simply going to add a spike panel
which contains a few menu items so let's
say stunt panel and inside of here we're
going to use the alive body now this is
inherited from the text control so it
has things like font font size text
color and so on and we'll give this the
value of home because that's this is a
home page or create some others such as
maybe about and contact so we have three
links here and when we click these links
we can fire a particular click event
so let's write some JavaScript and
inside of our JavaScript we can export
some functions
so we could have a function named
navigates to page and perhaps we pass in
a page here and for now I'm simply going
to cause the draw because it's future
videos we can look at navigation and
pages and stuff right now we're simply
looking at the draw inside of a life so
at the moment we're going to close the
draw whenever we click this page so we
could directly export this function or
we could simply say module 2 on exports
and of course export our navigate to
page function we can add them a click
event with clinked to navigate to page
and then when the user clicks this the
drawer should close and then your
application we can navigate the user
away the draw itself depends on in menu
so we need to state that we have a
binding with UX binding equal to menu so
we're essentially saying that the slug
panel here is the menu for our draw in
order to access the draw inside of our
courtier to closely draw we need to give
this draw a name so UX mam equal to draw
and if we take a look at our project
inside a few studio by running fuse
preview we can then click this afar
button at the middle bottom of the
screen if we click that you're notice
our application so it goes away to the
right gets smaller and then we have
access to our draw this is a very nice
animation and if we click one of these
menu items such as home about or contact
the draw causes and we get to our
application at once again if we wanted
to remove this button at the bottom here
we could simply say hide button is equal
to true and as you can see we no longer
have this button if you wanted to create
your own button for example if we had a
button with the text of open draw and
when the button is clicked
we could call a function and author and
draw and would start a little comment to
do something like navigates to page
close draw here we could say draw dot
open so if we hide the flat button from
within the draw will no longer see that
so we could then make our custom button
inside of the draw
perhaps aligned in the center and this
button will simply have some text of
open drawer and a clicked event of open
draw and we can quickly comment this one
to say do something with page and closed
drawn
this one can now fear or permit draw and
we can see draw open let me take sport
I'll function so if we now click open
draw we've made our own custom button
that opens the drawer and if we click
anywhere
it does indeed cause that draw now there
are different themes that we can use
with the alive UX kit and we should
always have no matter what if fallback
theme using the alive dot fallback theme
and this will fall back to ear light
theme this is the theme that we see at
the moment but we also have the
opportunity for a dark theme so if we
want to use the dark theme we have to
enclose our application inside of a
panel like so so let's take everything
outside of the panel and place it inside
and then from within side of the panel
we can say alive dot dark theme and if
we save the file and rebuild the project
and if we click open draw now we see
that we get that dark theme instead of
that light theme whatever theme that you
use is up to you theming itself is its
own video and as we're inside a few
you'll right now let's have a look at
how we could theme I would draw so if we
hit the selection tool we can select
these different things such as the stack
panel or the body elements if we select
the stack panel that contains these
alive body elements we can select
horizontal Center and this will put all
the elements inside of the horizontal
Center if we take a look then inside of
our chords this has been updated to add
this alignment of horizontal Center and
it just goes to show how powerful this
is when we combine border the methods
together you can use both visual styling
for example within few studio and inside
of your chords
I hope you've enjoyed this introduction
to the draw within the alive UX kits
inside a fuse professional I'm excited
to look at the different things within
fuse and of course the alive draw if you
interested in more fuse videos then of
course

updated let me know what you think of
the draw inside of the comment section
below and until next time my name is
Paul and I'll see you very soon in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
