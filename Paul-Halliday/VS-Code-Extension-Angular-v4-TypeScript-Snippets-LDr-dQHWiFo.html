taking a look at the angular 4
typescript Smythe's extension inside of
our visual studio chord setup so as you
can see right here we have this angular
v4 typescript snippets you can install
this by searching it on the marketplace
and as you can see straight out the bat
we have a variety of Smith's they are
consistently updated with best practices
we have everything from components from
a root of components directives modules
pipes services and much more to use
these inside of your application it's as
simple as using air - and then we have
access to all of the components all of
these components also have predefined
areas in which we can type so for
example if we want to make the app
components we could of course and the
selector to be up the template component
could be up tour component or HTML and
each time we're pressing tab to move
along to the next section so if I select
tab now we now move to the component
name so we could change that into app so
it's super easy to make edits to the
templates and snippets and we could do
the same for everything
for services we have things like HTTP
service which automatically imports
things like observable HTTP response and
so on you can even also generate lazy
loaded routes so there would be a
snippet for a lazy loaded angular module
similar for route guards we can even
make complete route guards from the
snippets and much more so this is a good
plugin if you use angular a lot with
your workflow I'd definitely recommend
this so don't forget to install the
angular v4 typescript snippets inside of
your vs chord extensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
