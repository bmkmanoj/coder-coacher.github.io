announcement that the ionic CLI v3 has
now been released this is going to
change the way that we use the ionic CLI
and quite a few commands have being
removed and some of the commands have
been reflected let's take a look at the
cheat sheet to see these sort of
differences between the ionic CLI and
the ionic 3 CLI at the moment in the
ionic to CLI we would have to say
something like ionic run Android or
ionic build Android but now we say ionic
Cordova run Android and ionic Cordova
build Android other commands have
changed to incorporate that Cordova
syntax and a lot of commands have been
removed such as setup share Lib IO and
so on let's upgrade our ionic CLI to the
version 3 the first thing I'm going to
do is uninstall the current version of
the ionic CLI so NPM uninstall - G ionic
now that that's completed we can add the
ionic 3 CLI by saying npm install - g
ionic at latest awesome if we now type
ionic we see that we have a different
CLI version s3 point note if we then
head over to our repos directory and
make a new ionic project we could say
ionic start my ionic 3 project based on
the blank template and this hasn't
changed
we could click enter and we can see our
project is made with the ionic 3 seoi
and the installation it looks a little
bit different you'll notice that this
installed the ionic CLI plugin for ionic
angular and the CLI plugin for Cordova
if we have an existing ionic project who
will have to install this into our
project and I'll show you that in a
second
for now let's say no we don't want to
use tools like ionic view at this moment
and we can see our project has now been
created at my ionic 3 project but I have
a project that was built with the ionic
to CLI let's try and run that so I'm
going to run ionic serve and we're told
that this looks like it's an ionic
angular project
would you like to install the CLI plugin
for ionic angular will select yes and
this will go ahead and install the ionic
angular plugin for our older projects
another thing everyone use Cordova
inside of our project we also have to
install the ionic Cordova CLI plugin so
let's play for ionic Cordova and as
we're trying to do some of the cod over
this Eli's picked us up and it's saying
the plugin CLI plugin Cordova is not
installed let's say yes we do want to
install what all of these things are
installed by default whenever we create
a new project with the ionic CLI v3 but
when we're upgrading an old project we
will have to add these dependencies so
from now on you'll see me using the
ionic CLI v3 and I suggest that you
upgrade it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
