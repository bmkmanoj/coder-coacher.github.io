the ionic tooltips module this allows us
to add a tool tip to our ionic
applications to get started we first off
need the angular animations module so
let's install that by saying npm install
at angular slash animations and we'll
ensure to install the version four one
three
and that's because currently ionic and
angular are using a version of 4.13 of
angular you can change this in the
future to match your other angular
dependencies but for now it's 4 1 3 I'm
also going to add - - save to this I
don't need to because I'm running NPM 5
and above but you may need to do this if
you're not running that so now that
we're happy that we have the correct
version of angular animations and it
matches our other angular versions and
in order to confirm the current version
of angular that you're using inside of
your project check out your package
don't JSON and you should be able to see
for example for 1:3 here after that we
can head back over to our command line
and we can then of course install the
ionic tooltips module so let's say npm
install ionic - tooltips and we'll add
the save parameter once again if
everything worked correctly you should
see that the package was added now the
first thing to do is head over to our
imports inside of our routes app module
TS and from within here we can import
the tooltips
module and that comes from ionic
tooltips so once you've done that we can
head over to our page and in this sense
I will go to the home to HTML let's set
up a basic application so we'll say
tooltips we'll change the color of the
navbar to be primary
and in here one adds a few buttons so
we'll start off with is standard button
that has an eye on button era beads
everything is standard for now but we
can also now add something called a
tooltip if we add the tooltip at review
and we pass along a particular string
for example if we pass along tooltip
without position and the button text
will simply be tooltip for one if we
take a look at our app when we click
tilt it one you can see that we have
tooltip without position and that
appears simply on top of our button
let's make ourselves another button but
this time we'll call a tooltip too and
in this sense we will give it a position
at V now this will be the vertical
position and this can either be top or
bottom so we'll make one with the
tooltip two of top and tooltips three
over bottom so we can rename this now to
be tooltip position V top and we'll do
the same for this one but instead we'll
say at bottom we'll change the text to
be tilt at top and tooltip of bottom so
let's take a look let's click the
tooltip at the top and of course now we
can see that our tooltip appears on top
and if we click tooltip bottom I'll
tooltip appears on the bottom this is
the same for all operating systems let's
do the same for our top I'm going to tip
the top button and we'll copy paste this
and we'll say a tooltip position V top
and arel
so in order to use the arrow it's fairly
simple we can just add the arrow
attributes
and now if we click that button you can
see that we get this tiny little arrow
at the bottom of our box in a similar
sense to our position V we can also use
a position hitch
now if position hitch can either be
right or left so I'm going to copy the
two position top and bottom
we'll piss that and we'll replace the V
for a hedge one with the left and the
other for a right if we take a look at
this once again inside of our browser
and we click position hedge left and
position hitch right you can see that
our tooltips appear to both the left and
right of our buttons
once again we could add an arrow to this
so if we add the arrow to the right so
let's now click the tooltip position
hitch and arel and as you can see we
have that arrow this is all reflected
when we lock it in at the desktop view
so if we click here we do see our right
arrow and over here it is to the right
to the left to the top with an arrow the
bottom the top and so on we can add the
duration and then of course pass in a
particular number of milliseconds this
defaults at 30,000 but if we put
something in like 10,000 and we can say
10,000 if we click to our bottom tooltip
here you'd see that instead of lasting
for three seconds it would last for the
full 10 seconds let's say we have a
button and that button navigates us to a
different page we need a way to specify
that a particular tooltip belongs to in
nav button so if we pretend for this
moment in time I'm gonna copy this I'll
remove the duration for this one and we
pretend that this one is actually enough
button so say and nav if this was in
that button we can add the nav tooltip
attributes and what this does is it
tells the module that this of course is
a navigation button and finally we also
have the ability to determine the
particular event to show our tooltip on
now we could add event is equal to and
we'll change this to be event instead of
nav and this can either be click or
press
the default value of this is press but
of course we can't change this to click
also if we wanted to we could take this
tooltip here and we can bind this to a
variable so let's make a variable inside
of all home ts with tooltip text is
equal to this is a tooltip and instead
of entering the text here in our markup
we can simply pointer at that variable
and we'll call this one custom variable
if we now click our position H right
arrow and custom variable you can see
that we do get this is it tooltip and
that comes from the variable inside of
our component so the ionic tooltips
module allows us to add tooltips to our
project and of course it's quite
powerful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
