out the parcel web application bundler
this is a bunless similar to web pack
and it's kind of trying to compete in
the same space but instead of having a
larger or even quite small config file
with WebP ike parcel aims to simply just
be a plug-and-play option
so essentially you just run parcel from
the indexed or HTML file and of course
everything happens from then on you then
get things like bundling of assets hot
module replacement and much more it is
quite a new project so I'm not putting
away web Punk just yet but it is
something to look out for the future and
of course competition in this area is
always good so we'll be looking at it in
the context of a view GIS application so
let's at the getting started guide and
take a look at what to do so as you can
see it's a web application bundler and
the first thing we need to do is install
the parcel bundler like so so let's run
this npm install or yon depending on
what you use on your system so let's run
npm install parcel - bundler - g while
that's installing we'll take a look at
what to do next and that's of course to
make a new package JSON inside of our
project so let's make a new directory
called P - of view inside of here we'll
run NPM in it - why and this will start
up a brand new package dot JSON with
some default data so the next thing to
do is of course to make it indexed or
HTML and of course then have an entry
point so let's make an indexed or HTML
like that and at the same time well here
we'll install view
inside of our index.html we'll simply
have a standard HTML file and as always
with a view application we'll need a div
to put in our content with the ID of app
at this moment in time I'm simply gonna
have an h1 inside of that that says
hello parcel and because we have the
parcel bundler installed we can actually
run parcel index.html and what this will
do is it should take that indexed or
HTML file and use it as the entry points
for our application it tells us that we
can then navigate to the localhost call
on one two three four and when we do
that of course we do have that hello
parcel text now that's cool but at this
moment in time we don't have any sort of
bundling and also if we were to write
some es6 it wouldn't be transpiled down
to es five so let's now add a script
that contains an apt GS we'll need to
make an AB dodgy s and inside of here I
want to import a view and that comes
from view slash dist / view GS then
we'll simply have a new view instance
that will be pointed at the app div and
it will have a template which says h1
and maybe we'll just have a name that we
can power on the screen and our data
object can simply have a new name of
pool Halliday if we then like it at our
project we can see that of course we
then have that name on screen if we look
at the sources tab you'll see that
everything has been converted down to es
5 if we then look at the dist folder you
can see our javascript file and if we
search for something like the NIM that
we typed in you can see that of course
our module has been bundled as part as
this file
if we then check out the JavaScript here
you can see that we do have the module
that we created here an app door yes
as well as view bundled into that same
file the next thing I'd like to do is
take a look at how we can use transforms
to change our code from being es6 to es5
this is quite simple all we need to do
is add the bubble preset end so then
inside of our project we can run npm
install bubble - preset - end or we then
need to do is create a don't babble RC
file and step that the presets should of
course load the end of the preset
because that's the one we just installed
and then going to restart our parcel
server and if we once again take a look
and then if we restart our parcel server
we can like inside of the development
tools and we should be able to see that
where we had const previously we now
have a bar
so notice that this was very easy to get
up and running with our project in my
opinion it still doesn't reflect back
but it's good to have some competition
