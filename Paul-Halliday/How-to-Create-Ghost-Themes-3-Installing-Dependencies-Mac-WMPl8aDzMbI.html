and installing our dependencies inside
of Mac OS so the first thing we need to
do is download Nord jazz version six
five zero now there are a few ways in
which we can do that on Mac I like using
homebrew as a package manager to install
not if you want him you don't have to
use homebrew you could simply hand over
to Nord Jazz org hit other downloads
previous releases and then install Nord
GS here at version six five zero by
hitting the Downloads button and then by
installing the appropriate version for
Mike the shunt be the Nord 6.50 package
but I'm gonna do this a little different
way what I'm going to do is use homebrew
so if we head over to brew don't Sh we
can download the package manager we can
then copy the string here into our
terminal and that installs the homebrew
package manager on our machine once that
has completers we can run brew updates
to make sure we have the latest version
of homebrew this is especially important
perhaps if you've had homebrew installed
in the past and you need the latest
version and then we can use brew install
node by using brew install nodes this
will most likely install the latest
version of nodes but if you can select
that I would select node six on node six
point five zero but if you can't I'm
going to sure you're aware in which you
can change the version of your nord GS
installation so I usually run with NPM
version five and an old version eight
that's just because the latest version
of Norden NPM is currently those numbers
how do we change that well we can use
something called nvm so first off and
show that you can run no dash V after
installing it with brew install node and
if your numbers are
below six five zero for example if the
six one zero you'd be completely fine
and you could continue but if your
numbers are higher than six five zero
then you will need to use a lower
version of note and this is similar
because at this moment in time the ghost
see light doesn't actually support a
greater version so in order to do that
we need to head over to NV m for node
version manager don't Sh
we can then install the following script
and if we copy that into our terminal
and if we hit enter now I already have
nvm installed you can see that it goes
ahead and downloads NV m and in order to
add this to our environment variables we
need to copy the string here copy
everything but the comments here at the
end and paste this into our terminal and
hit enter we can then type nvm nvm then
allows us to use a particular version of
note let's type nvm install 6.50 this
will install node six point five zero
and then we can use nvm use 6.50 to use
that particular version of nodes we are
finally nearly done if we type nodes
dash V and NPM dash V you should have
similar numbers to me like I said it's
really important that you get this done
correctly else of course you won't be
only use the ghost CLI so the final
thing to do is to install ghost a - CLI
and used - G this allows us to install
the C like globally on our machine and
when we do so we can use it anywhere we
want inside of the terminal
so we now have the ghost CMI installed
if we type ghost you'd see that this is
installed correctly it tells us that we
need to run course to help if we want to
know how to use the ghost COI
but if we get that message that means
we've done everything correct so far so
potentially a little bit hassle to get
started but once that is done there's no
more configuration we don't have to
worry about that at all and we can just
worry about creating our themes let's
jump into creating our first ghost
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
