photo to our application so at this
point in time we currently have this
header bar at the top here we have some
cards we have a pagination control but I
want a footer below all of that so
inside of our default door handle bars
we could go ahead and add a photo tag
but as always I want to create a new
partial so we can inject that and also
so we can keep everything separated so
let's make a Fatah don't hitch PS inside
of here we'll add a photo with the class
of butter and also is centered because
at this moment in time I want everything
to be centered inside of our photo we'll
add a div for the class of container so
I'll add a container to our photo and
then perhaps we'll add a div with the
class of columns so we'll add some
columns once again and we can add a
couple of columns so add a div with the
class of column and we'll do that twice
in both cases for now we'll have a h1
will give that the class of title and
we'll simply say hello and then our
other column just to get things rolling
we'll add this one with the text of
world if we save that and then head back
over to default or HBS we can then add
the partial for our footer in the same
way as we did our header so let's then
add two handlebars will then also add
the greater than sign and we'll add a
footer once we do that and save our file
you can see that we have these two
columns and at this point in time the
text is not centered so that's why it
looks a little strange so we can go
ahead and inside of our column we can
also give the class of title and also
has text centered to our h1 and we'll do
it in both scenarios so we now have
efforts on at the bottom of our screen
let's add some content to that footer so
I'm going to add a photo that allows us
to display recent posts and also feet
good posts let's take a look at nuts in
the coming lectures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
