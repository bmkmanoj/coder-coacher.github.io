at an accessory for zero and as you can
see on screen we have a substantial
amount of bug fixes features and
performance improvement to get this in
your application
we're going to upgrade a standard up
from ionic 3.30 to a three point four
zero you can see here that there's been
a substantial amount of changes to the
keyboards with some refactoring of the
chord and causing a lot of issues there
seems to be a lot of excitement around
the latest potential ionic v4 builds
which we're sort of seeing on github in
alpha mode at the moment with web
components I'm really excited for that
but for now let's lock it ionic 34 0 and
upgrading that inside of our apps so
I've yet to test this with the latest
angular 4.2 but if you want to you can
go ahead and upgrade to ionic 4.2 and
let me know inside of the comments to
see your response but at the moment I'm
going to stick at a four point one three
as I know this is definitely stable with
that outside of that we can knock our
ionic native versions up to the latest
which is currently 3:12 1 and this then
also goes for each one of your ionic
native plugins that you do actually have
inside of your project the main thing
here is upgrading our ionic angular 2
3.40 and of course will also knock up
our rxjs 25.40 hours on jess can be
upgraded to 0-8 12 and that should be
everything for now Behrman that these
numbers on screen at the moment and not
going to be indefinite things are going
to change and upgrades as time goes by
into like I said already there's a
higher version of angular Alba I haven't
tested it with this version yet so I
don't want to recommend it but it's many
medicine that I'm going to be fine but
like I said these are just how we can
upgrade our project from 3.3 to 3.4
it's up to you from there on out to
continue and keep your project up to
date but to get this actually in your
project let's remove our node
giuls from here on out we can then run
npm install providing you saved your
package to json and this will install
the node modules inside of our app based
on the versions that we've specified
here in our dependencies so there should
be ionic 3.40 as well as the other
changes if you're interested in learning
more about ionic don't forget I have a
course to learn anak 3 from scratch and
you can find that inside of the
description and today I've just launched
in new course which is mastering ionic 3
with ionic native so that looks a
different ionic native integrations
everything from the camera to a YouTube
player looking at things like contacts
push notifications with one signal and
local notifications and much more so
have an early bird discount chord where
you can check them out and get them
super cheap while they are still in
early access thanks a lot for watching
don't forget to upgrade your
applications to ionic three four zero
and until next time I'll see you very
soon in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
