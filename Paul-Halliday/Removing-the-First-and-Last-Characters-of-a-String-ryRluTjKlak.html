the first and last character from a
string were given one parameter the
original string and for this challenge
we don't have to worry about strings
that don't have less than two characters
so let's make an hour remove character
function will return string just to stop
this from airing
constant called substring and that will
be equal to remove character with the
string of Paul if we simply log this out
we can see that we have the string pull
but we want to cut the first and last
letter so that'll be P and L we can
first off start by getting the string
length and that can be done by saying
string length and assigning this to ear
string length variable and now that we
know how long the string is so it's four
we can cut both 1 and 4 so we can return
its substring by returning STR don't
substring starting at character one and
ending at the string length character
minus one
so this returns us everything in the
middle so if we extended our strength to
be Paul Halliday we'd have all holida
which is of course without the P and Y
so let's take this and we can paste it
here inside of the solution it should
then run some tests and we appear to
have passed
so let's submit this and see what other
people have done other people have used
methods such as strength slice so let's
take a look at that as you can see we
have the string leant at the moment so
let's take a look at that instead of of
course using the string length we don't
need to care about that at all because
we just want to take the final string by
using string dot slice and that gives us
the same answer so we starting at the
beginning and then taking one off at the
end another one that I found quite
interesting is this use of regular
expressions here to replace the string
based on the last characters let's copy
the end by Leon and we'll see exactly
what happens as you can see we have the
same response instead we're just using a
regular expression but all in all this
video has looked at how to create new
strings remove items from strings and
then at the same time just at the end
here we've looked at how we can replace
a string
