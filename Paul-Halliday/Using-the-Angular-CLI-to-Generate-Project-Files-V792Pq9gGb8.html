C to stop the current and G serve and
then I'm gonna clear my terminal with
the clear key words or CLS on windows
and now we are going to say ng generate
now ng generates allows us to generate
project specific files you don't
necessarily have to understand what
these files are at this point in time
just that we'll be using it throughout
the course to generate boilerplate codes
some examples of things that we can
generate our components so let's
generate a component and at its heart a
component is simply a reusable piece of
functionality and we'll call our
components simply my component let's hit
enter and you can see that it creates
all of these different files and updates
our app module don TS the different
files that it creates is HTML for our
view so that's the content of the
components or the piece of functionality
the CSS which is the styling of our
component the TS file which is all the
functionality of the component and the
spec TS which is the testing
functionality for the component itself
we're then updating the app modular TS
and that is essentially a list of all
the dependencies inside of our project
so the routes and module is responsible
for holding all of the different things
that make up our project so all of the
different components services and other
functionality so we can generate
everything from directives which we'll
look at in the future so don't worry too
much for now just know that we can
generate directive a pipe it's service
make new classes nerve guards interface
nomes and modules if we wanted to
generate this module inside of a
particular folder we could make a new
folder by saying feature slash and then
the name of our modules will be my
module so if we do that you can see that
it installs our module it creates a new
file under the feature folder which
creates then a new folder for our module
and then the my module module don TS if
we quickly like it at our project and we
head over to our app component TS and
the way that I'm traversing the file
system at the moment is with command P
inside of Visual Studio cords it will be
ctrl P on Windows and you can simply
type the name of your file so if we
wanted up to a component it would tell
us where it is inside of source slash
app but otherwise you could do this by
hitting command B and I imagine it's
control being on Windows and if we just
navigate to source app and component ES
and straight away you can see that we
have what's known as a selector that
selector allows us to use that
components inside of our HTML and the
prefix for any component that we would
make at the moment is app and if we go
back to our angular CLI JSON and we find
our prefix here which is up you can see
that we could change that to be our
specific project so if we change that to
awesome you could see there any new
components that we would generate would
get the selector of Awesome - something
there are other ways to change this as
well if we head back over to our command
line you can see that we can use ng
generates and I'm simply going to make a
component that would be in the feature
folder and currently a folder called my
module but we could also prefix this
with something different we could use -
- prefix equals and change this to
something like banana so this would then
use a different prefix than the awesome
prefix that we specified
and if we headed over - oh my - module
components yes don't worry you won't
name anything like this inside of the
course but you can see that we now have
the selector of banana - my module so
you can change this when I be generating
new things with the angular CLI but by
default it will be app we've changed
that inside of the angular CLI config
but if you wanted to change things on
the fly with the prefix are a beaut you
totally cut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
