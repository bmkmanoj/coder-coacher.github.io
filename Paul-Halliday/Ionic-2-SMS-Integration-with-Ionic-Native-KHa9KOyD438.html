2 and today we're going to be adding SMS
to an ionic 2 application I've gone
ahead and made my own balanca ionic 2 up
named my FMF by using ionic start my FMS
blank b2
once you've done that we'll need to add
the Cordova SMS plug-in by simply typing
ionic plug-in adds Cordova SMS plug-in
we can now open up in vs cord and start
cord
I'm going to build out the UI first so
I'm going to run ionic serve cool so
we've got our up running in the browser
let's go over to the home component in
source form HTML and we're going to
simply change the title to my SMS
application we're going to change the
navbar color view primary which is blue
a little concealer and then going to add
a card with a couple of fields and slide
and what we need is a button at the end
of that inside the button I'm going to
put an ion icon and the icon assembly is
going to be a checkmark
and we're going to say send
if a preview of what it looks like we
can add a phone number into em and
partner on a message like this cool
let's go to the home component now but
before we do that I'm going to go in my
TF config and I'm going to change the
target from es5 to AES sakes this is
because we're going to be using
something called a width and air sink so
let's make an async function the async
function is going to called send text
message and of course it's just going to
be specimen a text message to do this
we'll need to import the SMS class from
the ionic native library and we can do
this by typing SMS defender requires a
phone number under strength at the
moment we'll just simply pub run a
number and a message when this is done
it resolves a promise now a standard way
to resolve the promise and you can do it
like this if you want instead of using
async is to simply get the result and
log the result or you can do whatever
you want with that if you want to
display a message there'll be a good
time to do that
alternatively you can then or sort
rather as well as you can use catch to
get the error if there is one and we can
control log out the error I'm going to
do a little bit different little I'm
going to use the await keywords this is
sort of does exactly the same as what we
just saw there it resolves the promise
but everything after the await keywords
will only be run once but promises
resolved so I'll give you an example of
that so if we run SMS box and then we'll
meet the phone number again and a
message
we'll be run until that is actually
resolved so we can enter their console
dot log was sent but how do we of course
check to see whether that was an error
an error well we can't be put it in a
try-catch block like that now at lonely
work if the promise was resolved and not
rejected if it was rejected there's an
error we can catch it here so I'm going
to make a toast controller at a tool
control to the project and then I'm
going to show a little message when it's
successfully all unsuccessfully sent
your conduct force and a going to this
Vauxhall's controller so create simply
going to show a message which says tanks
with sent duration of which it's going
to be three seconds we can then present
the sauce to like that now this cost
will not present unless the text message
was actually sent and we're copy pets
tears into the era not twice and we
notice a text message was not sent so
basically now we can check to see
whether it was sent whether it wasn't
and if it wasn't then obviously will
assure message we need to hook this up
now to an object so I'm going to
basically say a text message and that
needs to be a string and then I'm going
to say phone number is going to be a
number we can
the phone number three be it cell type
in pot and what we can then change in
our SMS is we can simply put the string
on number string do this dot for number
three and then we can change that for
this dot text message
now we need to hook this up to our model
our review rubber so we can add ng model
and we can simply pop phone number on
here and here we can do this in so this
message okay that's what we call that is
that right phone number and text message
right phone number text message final
thing we need to do is hook up the
button here for a click event and the
click event will be send text message if
we've done everything right and run this
on the device it should of course send a
text message to the number that you said
in the view thanks a lot for watching I
hope this was helpful if you want more
