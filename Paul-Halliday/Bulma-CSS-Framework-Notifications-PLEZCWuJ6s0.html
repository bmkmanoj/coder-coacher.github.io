and notifications inside of Balmer CSS
so let's start out by making a new div
with the class of simply notification if
we hit enter without typing any text we
can see that we now have this gray
border I'm going to place it inside of a
mobile view to make this a lot easier to
see and we can make ourselves a button
with the class of delete and you'll
notice now that we have this X at the
top right of our notification this is
awesome for us because we can simply add
a custom click event and what we can do
is hide or remove this notification with
that delete button outside but now we
need some dummy text
I simply have some Star Wars Epsom
and when we save the file we can now see
that we have a functioning notification
let's copy this a few times with some
different colors
and we can start off with the class of
notification and is primary instantly
you can see that we have our green color
once again
secondly we can add notification is info
this plan with info we do get map blue
color I'm going to go down now and add
the rest for success warning and danger
and if we take a look inside of our
application we have initially a simple
notification with noir class and next we
have a notification with our primary
color then our info color our success
color warning and then danger
so these notifications are really bold
and do stand out inside of our app and
they should ideally be used to alert
your users of a particular event so that
wraps up using notifications inside of
Bombers ESS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
