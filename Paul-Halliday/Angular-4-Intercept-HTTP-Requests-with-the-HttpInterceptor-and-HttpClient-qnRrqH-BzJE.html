looking at the HTTP interceptor inside
of angular for point X so if we search
for a person inside of our application
we'll pull up their github profile and
we'll have information about them if we
take a look at our up this is done with
our github service and it's very simple
service what this does is define a root
URL which is of course the github API
and we have one function get user
information we pass a user ID and this
returns us a user which of course has a
variety of different things such as a
name company blog and much more so
perhaps in your application you find
that you need to pass in a particular
header such as an authorization API key
this is what we're going to be doing in
this up and we'll be starting off inside
of our github server so we have our HTTP
call here when the user or rather us as
the developer calls this we get a HTTP
request we're going to build in what's
known as an interceptor to intercept
this request and then pass through a
header so as you can see it currently
works fine on authenticated but we could
run into a rate limiting issue if I kept
refreshing this it would block me from
the API unless I was signed in with an
API key so let's build an HTTP
interceptor inside of our services and
I'll say github don't interceptor don't
TS I do have an angular course available
where we build this exact project and
that's over a Paul holiday tour io if
you'd like more information about this
project but for now let's use export
class github HTTP interceptor this will
implement the HTTP interceptor interface
and that comes from angular common HTTP
so when we implement this interface this
means we need an intercept function
we're passed in a request and that's a
HTTP request and we'll specify the body
as a user let's also import HTTP request
from angular common / HTTP as well as
HTTP handler and that's our next
parameter this is of type HTTP handler
and what this allows us to do is return
next dot handle and pass through that
request well this is essentially doing
is simply passing the request straight
forward and we're doing nothing with it
this is the absolute minimum boiler
plates to get a Interceptor working now
if we wanted to add a particular header
to this we could start off by creating a
new request and that will be based on
the previous request using request dot
clone and we'll specify in new headers
by using request headers dot set for
example if I wanted to add an
authorization header I could do so and
then I could add the github talkin like
so this would then authenticate us with
the API or indeed whatever API that
you're using because would be passing
through that authorization header with
each one of our requests
we could also console.log the new
request we could log things like the
request dot a body and that will give us
the request body but prior to going any
further what I want to do is actually
initialize this inside of our app so I'm
gonna head back over to my core module
and I'm gonna register this by using
provide and I want to provide the HTTP
and acceptors
and that comes from angular common slash
HTTP but I want to use a different class
that will use the HTTP interceptors but
will override that with our github HTTP
in a sub duck and remember that comes
from our services folder and if we
wanted to provide multiple interceptors
we could add multi equal to true so what
this is then doing is registering the
HTTP interceptor using the one that we
created inside of our application let's
take a look at this so here we have our
HTTP request and that goes to the URL of
the github API slash users slash at the
user that we selected we go through and
select a different user and it's like
myself again and click search and as you
can see we get the same thing we have
null for the request body because that's
null at this point in time so I'm going
to remove that for now but more
importantly if we take a look at our
HTTP request and we look down at our
request headers we can't see our
authorization and that's because we need
to handle on the new request rather than
the previous request so beforehand we're
simply doing nothing with the request
and now when we pass through this new
request we should see a different thing
inside of the response headers so as you
can see we now got four or one
unauthorized inside of the response
headers and our authorization cord here
simply says talking here if we're to
replace that with our actual talkin we
would then get the results back but
would be using our API key so what this
is proven is that we've intercepted HTTP
request we've then set their new header
on the
West and ov use the HTTP handler to
instead use this request ie the one that
of corned instead of the previous
request let's take a quick look and how
we can determine whether a response is
an error or not so I'm going to close
this for now and drag this back let's
now take a look at how we can determine
whether we have an error with our
request so what we'll need to do is head
over to minty s and I'm gonna import our
XJS slash add slash operator slash do
and what this allows us to do is I don't
do on the end of our handle I'll simply
consult that log that for now and you'll
notice that we get this type 0 I'm going
to pass in a standard observable
response so this would be a success
response would console dot log success
this would be an error response and with
console dot log the error and if we save
this we can see that we now have a HTTP
our response with an error message of
bad credentials and a status of 4 or 1
so this allows us magical powers because
now we can determine whether we
authenticate it or not now there's much
more magic you can do here but I'm
simply going to check to see whether the
or adult status is equal to 4 or 1 and
that will essentially mean that we're
not authenticated and if we are we're
simply going to console the aura you are
not authenticated let's save this and we
get this magical aura now saying you are
not authenticated so hope you can
imagine that just how many other things
we could do at this point in time we
could navigate somebody away we could
pop up a login model we could do much
more so that's essentially how we handle
auras and of course we could do it much
better than s at this moment in time but
with inside of our HTTP and acceptors
this very high level overview but thanks
a lot for watching don't forget to check
out my angular course which covers this
along with some real-world projects over
at Paul Halliday denial and until next
time don't forget hit that subscribe to
stay updated and I'll see you soon in
that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
