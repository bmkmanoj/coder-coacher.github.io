Balmer CSS with boma we can define our
buttons using the button class so for
example if we had an anchor tag and that
anchor tag was a standard button with
the class of button we could then see
that we have this standard button we can
provide a variety of different styles to
this button by using the is - arrow
butte so let's take a look by copying
this button and instead we'll call this
one the white button for the white
button we can add is - white and as you
can see we have a button here but it's
different from our standard button and
is this white background we can do the
same for a variety of different colors
if we did it here for lights we could
use is light
and the same goes for dark black and
link each time we're simply seeing as -
and then what we want whether it's white
light dark and so on inside of our
application therefore we can see we have
a variety of different buttons all of
different colors this offers us a
variety of different standards / dark
buttons but we can also use different
colors similar to bootstrap let's now
take a look at the different colored
buttons and we can start off by copying
this at a standard button and seeing
instead that this one is primary and has
the color of is primary we can do the
same for info and success warning
and finally danger as you can see on
screen now we have a variety of
different colors such as primary in for
success
warning and of course danger
I'm going to comment this up for now and
this time we can take a look at
different sizes so Bamba offers us four
different sizes if we have ourselves a
button again this time we can have the
button and is small attribute and we can
call this one is small button
do the same for in normal button so this
one would be normal button notice that
we aren't using is normal normal is
default in this case we do the same for
button and is medium with the medium
button
finally we have button is large
inside of our browser
see that we have this small button the
normal button a medium-sized button and
of course a large button so that's how
we use different sized buttons with the
particular class names let's comment my
cell to once again and well so this one
is sizes and up here is colors as well
as colors and sizes we also have
different styles so we can go for a
standard outline style that you may have
seen in other frameworks and that can be
done with the standard anchor tag but
this time we're going to use is outlined
so simply call this one outlined and
this will be a basic outlined if we copy
this we can take these same colors from
before using things like is primary to
have a different color for our outlined
so we can do primary in full success
warning and danger as you can see here
we have a variety of different outline
buttons now if we select them you'll
notice that they remain selected and if
we deselect they go back to their
initial State
so let's say that these are our lines
and in this
we can take a look at inverting the
colors so it is similar principle with
the anchor tag having the button is
primary and also having now is inverted
the text color and that becomes the
background color and a vice versa so
let's call this one primary inverted and
I'll copy it for each one of them and as
you can see here we have that white
background color and the color of the
text of that button is now the
particular primary in for success and so
on you will notice that the yellow has a
black background when we invert a and
that's simply because you otherwise
wouldn't be able to read the yellow on a
white background
so let's call this one inverted
novel is we can take advantage of both
inverted and outlined and I'll copy the
sim inverted scored as we had before but
now we can add is outlined to each one
of them so it becomes button is primary
is inverted and also is outlined let's
add it to each one of our buttons and
we'll call it primary inverted and
outlined and do it for each one of our
colors as you can see now if we take a
look at our inverted and outlined
buttons obviously the warning looks a
bit out of place at this point but if we
select to something like primary you'll
notice that it now goes white for a
background and has of course that
primary color and if we select the
various different colors you'll notice
that we therefore can read them too now
those covered inverted and outlined we
can take a look at the different states
our buttons can be in
so we've seen our normal stats so if we
talk about States now the normal state
would simply be
our initial buttons without any
particular speed so in this sense we'll
back to our normal buttons here because
there is currently no state for that
button
next thing to look at is the hover space
so we can add is hovered to each one of
our buttons so call this primary Hobbit
button
rest of our colors
and in this sense it looks similar to
our normal buttons but things get a
little bit interesting when we come to
adding focused
so let's do it again but this time
instead of hovered we can change this
for is focused and therefore Hobbit
becomes focused for this I'm also going
to add a standard button without a color
so we'll just call this one normal focus
button
inside of our project you can once again
see and I've made this into its or
bigger screen that our buttons have this
very very slight shadow and that's
because the button is focused this is
more prominent if we put it in a smaller
screen and you can just see at the top
here we also have another state and that
is active so we can change that to is
active
you
can see that the buttons are now
depressed on the screen
so that is how the act of state lugs
another step that we also have is the
loading stance and this one's quite an
interesting state certainly shows off
much more than the other states do and
you should be seeing a recurring theme
here and that the framework is really
easy to use because anytime we want to
change something and use something like
loading or active or focused all we're
doing is adding this is loading class so
you can call this a normal loading
button and go through each one of our
buttons
you can see our buttons now have a
variety of different loading icons the
next thing to look at is if static
button so if we have for example is spun
with a class of button and is static you
can see that we have this non
interactive element on screen that
resembles a button but of course can't
be clicked like if standard anchor tag
or button if we took any one of our
buttons let's for example take the
normal state for each one of them we
could also take a look at what they look
like when they are disabled so in order
to do that we can add the disabled
attribute to each one of our buttons as
you can see our buttons are here but
they're grayed out and also it can't be
clicked this is different from the
static button we could of course remove
this attribute inside of our JavaScript
and then of course the button would be
available for use I've ensured to add
font awesome to the project so here's
the CDN and then we can also know like
at buttons with icons so we'd
potentially have a button like before
with is primary or a different color and
inside of our button we can have is spun
with the class of icon and for example
if we wanted to sure the font awesome
Twitter icon we could do that inside of
our icon spun using the eye tag and then
if we add something saying follow
maybe this button is to follow the user
on Twitter you can now see that we have
a button that has the primary color with
an icon and some text so that's how we
would make a button with icons and
obviously we can go through the
different colors once again as you can
see
a variety of different colors now we
have our primary we have our warning
info danger and so on we can group
together a variety of different buttons
for example if we add a div with the
class of field and is grouped which is
required here we can have ourselves our
previous set of buttons but
group together and I also have the
disabled attribute on the more - so I
will remove that you can see that
they're all aligned together
if we were to remove the field and group
to class you can see that they're no
longer aligned together and they
continue to then rub so that's how we
use a variety of different button
components inside the Balmer CSS
