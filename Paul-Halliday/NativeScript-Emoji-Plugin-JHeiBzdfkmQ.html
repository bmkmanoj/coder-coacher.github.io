Script emoji plug in so I have a new
angular based native script project in
them two native script - emoji and we're
going to add that plug-in to this
project we can do that by saying TNS
plug-in adds native script - emoji that
will fetch the plug-in and add this to
our project when that has finished we
can of course open this up inside of our
editor I'm going to be using the app
component for this as we only really
need one component to display this so
we'll start off by importing register
elements from a native script - angular
/ element - registry this allows us to
use a custom element inside of our
template we can then register this
element by saying register element emoji
and that element itself will be required
from the native script - emoji package
and then we have to hook into that and
more G return and here comes B magic so
I'm going to make it a stunt tunnel I'm
also going to change the name of the
title of this application to emoji and
then we can add our custom elements to
the stand panel so we'd have an emoji
with the name and the name will be the
name of the emoji that you want to show
so for example we have joy let's do
another one this time we'll do poop
which is one of my favorites next we can
have something like ear Robert because
joy poop and rocker is a good weekend I
think and finally we can end it with
something like maybe is speed board so
if we've done everything correctly we
should have four different emojis on
screen let's run this on the device and
see what we get so we can run T&amp;amp;S to run
and I'm going to run out on iOS so it
launches on the device and of course it
doesn't work and that's because I've
called there sis stuck panel instead of
a stack layout plently been doing too
much fuse
but if we save this we should now have
the emojis on screen let's check it out
and there we have it we have all four
emojis we have happy we've got poop
we've got rocker and we have airspeed
board I'm sure you can think of so many
uses for this plug-in and of course
don't forget to let me know how your use
meant in your project in the comment
section below and until next time hit
that subscribe button to stay updated
and I'll see you very soon in the next
