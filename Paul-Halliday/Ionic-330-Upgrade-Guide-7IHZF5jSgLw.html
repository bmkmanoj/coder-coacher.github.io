three-point-three is the euro has been
released and we have angular 4.1 X and
above as well as typescript 2.3 X in our
applications so this contains a few bug
fixes and features so it's definitely
worth upgrading to so we can start off
by ensuring that we have angular 4.1 to
you at the very least although there is
actually a higher ionic native version
available such as 3.1 at 0 X the
official upgrade guide does not say to
produce higher than 3.6 1 so it's up to
you if you want to take this higher then
you can experiment with that but
officially they said at least three
point six one as well as that we can
take our ionic angular 2 3 points 3 u 0
you can ignore the 5s dependencies here
because this project has fibers the
serviceworker toolbox has been upgraded
to 3 6 0 and ensure your ionic app
scripts is a 1 3 7 and typescript at
least 2 or 3 3
obviously with dependency versions
things change very fast but for ionic
3.30 this is the minimum level that has
been recommended by ionic if you want to
upgrade higher than this you certainly
can't just be whether things may not
work as intended and the next thing to
do is to remove the nord modules so once
we've done that we can run npm install
once again this will install our
dependencies back into the project based
on that package.json so any dependencies
you have inside of that file will be
installed into the node modules the
final thing that we need to do at this
point is remove the declarations DDS
from our source directory so we can
remove that and if we head back over to
the upgrade guide this is because it was
a legacy file introduced early on within
the ionic angular built
this is no longer necessary and by
removing this that we should be able to
get more accurate error messages for
import Stemmons so when you've done that
and you've run npm install that should
be a full upgrade to ionic 3.30 this
includes angular 4.1 - and typescript
2.33 so if you've upgraded your project
and you found this video useful hit that
subscribe button to stay up to date with
ionic 3 videos and of course I do have
the learn another three from scratch
course a link to that can be found
inside of the description so check that
out if you're interested in making
applications with ionic fire beers so
the github API and much more until next
time my name is Paul and I'll see you
very soon in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
