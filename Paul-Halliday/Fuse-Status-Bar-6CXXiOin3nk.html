status part within our Android and iOS
applications using fuse so let's make in
new fuse application with fuse create up
and the name of our app is going to be
status bar as always we can see D in two
status bar we can of course look at this
inside an emulator with fuse preview and
set the target equal to IO s this will
build our application for iOS and we can
subsequently run this on an emulator
while that's loading up but I'm going to
open this in a new tab and say chord
inside of dots this will open up inside
a visual studio chords inside of this
fallback so there we have it we have our
application on the emulator now on the
right and our visual studio chords on
the left if we head inside of our main
view UX we can start to define a status
bar now if we look inside of the
documentation we have something called
the status bar config and this allows us
to set different configuration methods
for Android and iOS
so as we're using an iOS emulator right
now we'll like in the iOS implementation
so we'll take this here and we'll add it
to our app so we'll add the iOS dot
status bar config we'll give it the
style of light the animation of slide
and is visible equal to true let's save
the file and you can see that the status
bar disappears this is because the style
of our status bar is light so if we had
something like a rectangle that filled
the entire screen so you give the fill
of this equal to a color such as purple
we can see that our status bar is
actually white and this is because of
the light setting here and the style if
we change this to instead be dark we
would get that dark style we could also
set is visible to false and our status
bar would disappear sounds good but what
if we wanted to change this on android
so
do a similar thing web server like
Android status bar config we could pass
air color and is visible equal to true
or false let's do that
and we can add a color best time so this
is the color for the status bar itself
not necessarily is style because at the
moment we're specifying either light or
dark whereas the color this point is
actually the color of the status bar
itself but what if we wanted to change
the color of the iOS status bar or maybe
the iOS and Android status bar but we
wanted it to be consistent well we can
do that as well
so we can do that with the status bar
background now the status or background
does something more than change the
color of the background when we put it
in this context and let me show you the
problem and then I'll show you the
answer so right now if we had a
rectangle and our other fill equal to
white and if we added a textview with
the value as hell or fuse you'll notice
that our text sort of goes over that
status bar not exactly what we want so
we can fix this by adding the status bar
background aligning that to the top and
then anything under that will already
has compensated for that space so the
docs are a good example of this we put a
dot panel and a panel underneath that
the panel is just representing anything
could be law the status bar so if we
added this dog panel to our project we
now see that this text is below the
status bar and one of the awesome things
about fuse is that if we click this
status bar bar gar we get to see the
representation of that inside of our
emulator we could then as a result
change the background color to in color
of your choosing so if I used a blue for
example this would change the status bar
to be blue we'd have to then remove the
color from the android status bar config
because I think this conflicts from my
tests so we could remove that and as we
have this blue status bar now we'd have
to change the style of our status bar
conflict to instead be light this
reflects this
Trask or another thing if we wanted to
remove this rectangle that takes up the
whole screen we could also change the
background color of our application with
this background element so we could
perhaps say that the background is
purple or we can make it equal to that
blue but this is just some examples of
how we can change the status bar within
our fuse applications so the spot rough
start using the status bar inside of our
fuse applications I hope you haven't as
much fun that what fuse as I am and of
course we're going to add we're more
fuse videos to the channel hit that

updated with those and let me know what

you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
