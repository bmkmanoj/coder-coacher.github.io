then yeah I think you'll be good idea
stallion so will Halladay and I'm very
passionate about projects like ionic
native script everything app development
especially in the JavaScript framework
side of things today we have Justin
Willis and he's gonna be talking about
ionic the future of ionic stencil and
maybe even stuff about the suppose it
avvocato so just don't tell me a little
bit what yourself yeah sure so I'm I'm a
dev relations here ionic so I am on
Twitter I yeah talk about all the cool
stuff they're working on the blog post
podcast such as this videos the ionic
show which we just did Friday yeah and I
basically talk about all things ionic
stencil all the new stuff we're working
on and try to help people be as
successful as they can with their with
ionic and and all of our tools yes so
you toefl the ionic show that can people
go back and look at those as there's
that anyone need to know yeah actually
let me I can actually pull up the link
real quick and put in the YouTube live
chat
give me just one second here and we go
here see we did a last Friday it was
live streamed it was the first first
live streamed ionic show we ever did it
turned out really good there are some
things we're gonna tweak in the future
like the the quality's not the video
quality the audio quality video quality
could be better but I think for our
first live stream went pretty well so
and it's not let him be put web
addresses in the day YouTube live stream
so you can actually just go to go to the
ionic channel on YouTube um so it's just
should be just like youtube.com slash
ionic I would think or maybe /c ionic
let's see here nope ionic give me just
one second there we go okay so you can
go to youtube.com slash c / ionic
framework and right there on the home
page that pops up it should be the the
top thing that's there it's just called
ionic show and you can see it was a
streamed yeah three days ago Friday yeah
so definitely go check that out so I
mean so if you got are you guys going to
start playing up sort of more
this could be sort of more recent things
so if people subscribe can he expect
more IO dog shows in the future
definitely yeah so you should definitely
subscribe we plan on doing a lot more
ionic shows I know there's a pretty big
gap between this one and the the one
before it but that we're not going to
let that happen again
yeah we plan on doing one maybe every
other month maybe yeah we're gonna shoot
for every other month but if we have a
lot to talk about we may do you know two
in a row it just kind of depends but
it's definitely not gonna be basically a
year until the next one like that yeah
last one was there yeah well it did
change in the last year and in the web
and with ionic themselves I mean exactly
you know I mean like so I mined myself I
built an ionic one application bike when
I was I had a job at in the sort of
Durham police and we basically made a
sort of crime application and we found
that I owned one was really good on
Gillard Jess was really good but one of
the things that we did miss was
typescript and that's you know I mean
static types and JavaScript is that one
of the reasons why you chose angular 2
or was it simply you know we have
angularjs we're simply just gonna fall
all the time zagore thank Allah - if
that makes sense with you yeah Google
recent versions of ionic yeah I got you
um so yes so it was kind of so I mean so
if we go back in history a little bit
when ionic one so we started out
actually with this thing called Kodaka
which was a jQuery drag-and-drop kind of
framework kind of thing so at that time
you know it's always been our goal to
where you could take like ion button for
example drop that into an HTML file and
then you just had this nice nice design
button that you can yeah that just looks
nice and you can use and it you can make
great apps with it
so back when ionic once first sort of
become a thing angularjs was like the
big thing yeah just like kids stable it
was backed by Google you know there was
tons of money and tons of developers
behind it and a great team too and they
work directly with us and you know we
built this this awesome game awesome
thing called ionic one so it was only
natural you know we had a lot of success
with ionic when we really liked
angularjs it wasn't perfect you know
there was some runtime performance stuff
that you know we had
work around a little bit you you know
make some best practices for but overall
it was a great framework and a lot of
people actually still use it so I'm you
know we we built ionic Qin had great
success
we really liked angularjs so it was
really only natural that when two
angular team came to us and was like hey
we're building this new thing called
angular 2 it's really cool why don't you
try it out you know let us know and
maybe you can you know rebuild ionic and
angular 2 so that was like super early
days for angular it was you know very
very beta and we loved it so we decided
you know ionic 2 plus it's gonna be
built with angular 2 so it kind of just
happened just because like it was cool
and it was the angular team and you know
we had had great sex great success with
angler so why not upgrade to the latest
right yeah of course I mean that that's
one the powers of angular 2 isn't it
we're like you know you can take one of
these projects you can build a component
and then of course you know you can just
drop that component into the project and
pretty much yeah I mean let's think but
other people want to use few GS react
and all these other stuff so how's the
house ionic themselves sounds like the
project sort of adapting to release
other libraries in the future yep so
that that kind of that's a really good
question actually so that kind of a that
kind of continues the history of ionic
right so we built ionic 2 and you know
that's we're on ionic 3.8 I think now as
the latest release 392 there we go
so yeah so we've had you know great
success with it we love angular it's
been going great people have built you
know there's there's apps like untappd
which is like a social network around
like beer there's a markup idols or kik
yes work it's a really nice one so yeah
people have had a lot success with that
they're building really cool stuff with
it um but you know we we love angular
but we've always wanted like like I said
that that goal that we started with was
you take a ion button you plop it into
an HTML file maybe add a script tag or
something and it just works and with
angular although angular is great you
know first of all not everybody uses
angular like angular is a great
framework but there's a lot of other
great frameworks to like react you know
pre-act I'm a pretty big fan of pre-act
of UJS etc and and you know when you use
a framework you can't really just plop
like an ion button into a into a page
right like you have to go all in with
the framework which is great but you
know it goes against our original goal
and then like I said we won't you know
there's all these great frameworks and
we want people to be able to use ionic
everywhere so that's when we got into
web components so you know when ionic
one first became a thing web components
were really a thing yet like they were
kind of like being expect out and stuff
but it just wasn't in browsers yet so
you know about a I don't know a couple
of months ago I guess it was has it been
that long you know we we took a hard
look at web components and said hey you
know web components are and not only in
chrome but they're in Safari now and web
components you know give us that
original power that we were looking for
right where you can take a take an eye
on button throw in an HTML page add one
script tag and things just work and this
also enables you to you know use ionic
anywhere so if you if you like view and
you want to have a nice like UI later
with a bunch of pre-designed components
you can use ionic and you shouldn't be
held back by which framework you prefer
you know held from using ionic see yeah
so we built this thing called um
I guess this kind of goes into a stencil
a little bit so we build this compiled
web component compiler called stencil
which is just a tool that we built to
enable us to build web components that
have cool things like lazy loading code
splitting et cetera
built-in but at the end of the day it
just outputs a web component so there's
you know it's very lightweight like
extremely lightweight like 5 5 mm around
five and a half kilobytes light weight
so that's like nothing and yeah to build
you know allows you to build really cool
components so we use stencil to if we're
actually in the process of porting all
the ionic components that you know and
love so you know I am but an eye on
header I on modal etc all to web
components using stencil and this will
there's an ionic core package it's
actually already on NPM
although and I know Paul has some
content around how
use it it's a it's still beta but it but
it's out there yeah
yep all yes sir so the ionic or package
itself I mean like I've been playing
around with you and and I think a few
other things like angular 1 point X and
I found it useful I can you know put in
a web component and obviously like I
said it's and bitter what do we do when
it comes to things like the toast
controllers and the the way that the nav
controllers for example are you letting
basically view GS underline are you
still bringing over than our controller
and that sort of sense definitely can
you tell my mother sure it's so that's
actually something that we're actively
working on it's like how our nav
controller works outside of something
like angular so we have like ionic
angular and nav controllers and that
project is very you know
angular-specific the way it works the
implementation is very specific to
angular issue um so that's actually
something that we're you know that we're
working on it's we're not we're not
super sure how we want I on nav to work
outside of an ionic angular project but
I'm kind of you know it's like you can
now it and and and this is definitely
something that we want people to be able
to do so you know if you're if you're
using react review and you really like
view router or you really I really like
react router you could totally use react
router and build an entire app you know
using ionic components but for your
router you can use you can use a react
router so so that's definitely you know
one use case for sure and I'm I on that
it's still you know still up in the air
if that's gonna be you know yeah that
that's the end of the it's it's still a
work in progress
yeah I mean because that's what it's
about I mean you kind of got the
slightest pause where ionic fits in the
soil project outside of angular because
like I said it's like you said it's
tightly integrated with angular when it
comes to things like the nav controller
but maybe when we got to integrate with
things like view and with web components
on I mean stencil has a router doesn't I
think two or more talk well and you you
know it might be that few GS and you
just keep the view router and that's the
best thing for you or maybe you know if
you're used to using ionic with the ion
now if you do make it a web component
type style
that might be better for you and your
project I suppose it comes down to
personal preference and and where you
want a developer definitely I totally
agree and yeah you got it right on the
head
you know if if it's viable to implement
that way obviously you know what I mean
because it might be that definitely yeah
I think that was one of the things that
on bordered me especially into
development was that ionic is just so
simple to get a project up and running
and the the end result of doing that you
know you have a mobile application that
basically you've run one command and the
CLI and you're ready to go on I think
that's if you can then take that
experience but change it so it's any
single sort of framework that you're
interested in I think you're definitely
gonna see a lot of success in the area
yeah that point so I should say like one
of the biggest reasons for us to go to
web components is that it simplifies
things even further so I always like to
say like the ionic way of doing things
is we're always striving to make things
simpler and faster so by moving to web
components
that's just enforcing that even more so
you know you maybe it becomes as easy to
use ionic it's it becomes just putting a
script tag in an HTML file and then
throwing you know HTML like I unbuttoned
into the HTML file and it just renders
and it you know it looks like a nice
ionic app so you know moving to our
components we're just working on making
everything even simpler than it already
is
so yeah yeah if you move the move to our
components itself let's say I'm an
angular developer this is a question
that I get quite often is is it gonna
affect me when we talk about ionic for
when we talk about moving to the stencil
and stuff will it affect me as in
angular developer the upgrade process
you know because when we talk about
ionic once ionic - obviously that was a
complete difference or framework I think
is it gonna be as big as that or is it
simply just gonna be changing some tag
names and maybe you know or can we
expect maybe next to no updates do you
know I'm set up great some I'll
definitely definitely yes so um see yes
so so I should say so
ionic or that is the NPM package that is
all the ionic components that's the
package that you can use anywhere so you
can you know use it and view react just
like we talked about I
angular 4 is going to be the same ionic
angular that you already know but under
the hood all the ionic components will
be web components
so we'll actually be using that ionic
core package and ionic angular so you'll
still be writing angular code just like
you always have but all the ionic
components underneath the hood will be
be web components so the upgrade process
so ionic angular 3 uses angular for
everything ionic angular 4 use angular
for your code our code is web components
the cool thing is the way that we
decided to the way that because web
components on how awesome they are the
upgrade process is actually relatively
easy so you actually don't even need to
really know that web components are
under the hood because all the code that
you write will always just be the same
angular code that you've always written
in your app the changes we're trying to
keep them always as always to a bare
minimum so I will say that it's not
gonna be anything near the ionic 1 to 2
ionic 2 ionic to jump we acknowledge
that was a big jump you know we think
it's worth it angular is a lot faster
especially runtime wise than angularjs
but it's definitely a big jump in if you
have a huge app you know that can
definitely be a huge yeah huge
difference and a lot of engineering time
so with ionic an angular 3 to ionic
Engler 4 it should be mostly like fine
to replace kind of things so it should
be you know so instead of just a so like
ion button for example it has an
attribute called block and it allows you
to expand the button to the edges of the
page and ionic angular forward that is
going to be feel or not feel expand
equals block so it's it's little things
like that a little like find/replace
like attribute changes and stuff like
that but we're trying to keep the API is
that you already know and love as close
to the same as we can so it won't be
anything like the jump from my endpoint
ionic 2 and we're trying to keep it
mostly to find and replace type things
sure let's get I mean that's good to
hear because you know it was the
question I hear a lot and you know
people are so whenever they hear like it
almost seems that some people
I sort of resistant to change because
you know the front end I suppose moves
so fast after a lot of people where you
know changing in version numbers is a
scary thing and yeah so you'd be here
Aliana for whenever it becomes a little
bit scary so yeah that's good too
yeah that's good and I should say yeah I
should say to that like the cool thing
is so you're gonna upgrade right so you
have your ionic angular 3 app you
upgrade ionic angular for the benefits
you get are much it should be much
smaller bundle sizes so the biggest
thing you should be shipping at that
point it's actually angular itself and
did faster run so I'm - because of our a
sync async rendering that we have built
in to web components that are built
stencil so you upgrade you get these
awesome advantages and only things you
really have to do is some find and
replace changes and like I said you
don't even have to do that it's under
the hood all you get to see is hey my
bundles are smaller and my app is faster
yes I mean it's good for people like me
as well here content careers and you
know when something changes that's the
scariest thing ever because no we hope
your horse that just doesn't work and
you know I experience on myself with
firebase recently where you know the
real-time database change to a new API
and so did five sort of finest all came
out and you know it invalidates a lot
and for a lot of people and you know
it's hard for people to upgrade because
you know people also don't have time to
have great in a lot of in other
circumstances they don't have time to
sit and read about how to change things
they just basically want to make a
project you have a goal and they want
something like ionic to where help them
with that so that's good news when it
comes to the sort of web components and
we talked about this before and with
ionic warned in angular 1 point X do you
find that when you Paul ionic Foley -
web components ionic one would then be
able to use this inside of the flame so
that's what you're looking at for those
people who are maybe stuck in ionic one
land maybe for enterprise reasons yep so
yeah that's a really good question - so
this has actually been so I should say
that up front and a cool site you can
check out as custom elements everywhere
com
so that's a site built by one of the
people on the polymer team and it kind
of tells you how good web components
work in certain frameworks so up front
angular one
you know was built before web components
were really a thing and it's its native
web components support is actually not
that great but Mac
one of the cofounders of ionic he has
this pet project that he's working on to
make make web components work really
nicely in angular 1 and the whole goal
of that project is to allow people who
may be stuck on ionic one so maybe they
just have a huge app and they just can't
spend the engineering time to upgrade
attire or ionic Engler to or rewrite it
and stencil or something like this
or you know just for enterprise reasons
just you can't upgrade so what this
would allow you to do is upgrade the
ionic components so you'll be using you
know the latest other components and get
all the nice UI updates but still have
all your you know ionic one code there
so that that is it's not it's not the
highest priority for sure the highest
priorities is you know getting ionic or
and stencil out but it is a it does work
on Max's machine and it's it's it's
gonna be pretty cool but it's definitely
not it's not the highest priority but
it's definitely one of our goals is to
be able to you know help out those
people that are still stuck on ionic one
yeah do you have gem to have any sort of
data to see how many people just sort of
sort of idea of how many people are
still using ionic wouldn't and that
something is it's still being used a lot
in production do you know um I actually
don't have like good numbers on that and
it's supposed it's quite hard to find
out but yeah but this one I was
certainly like thinking a lot as like
you know is I only one still a thing for
a lot of people because I imagine it is
an in sort of you know these older firms
that maybe have a smaller smaller
engineering team and sort of can't
really afford so then you know rewrite
everything that they have yep yeah um so
so I will say that we sir I on pointers
obviously it's in maintenance mode but
we actually do still release so a couple
of months ago there was kind of a
showstopper bug I think chrome changed
something or something like that and it
broke some old ionic 1 code um so we did
release an update oh it actually so
iPhone 10 - so iPhone Tim broke like
everybody's ass uh-huh so we did an
update ionic one to bring my phone's in
support the ionic one so it is in
maintenance mode we don't do active
development on it
if there is like a big breaking change
or something like that we do support
support you know support issues and
stuff like that
so if you are still stuck on ionic one
you're not gonna be getting any new
stuff but you will get bug fixes for
things that are like show stoppers so
yeah and and like I said you know one of
the one of the goals is eventually to be
able to because we're moving to web
components is allow you to upgrade all
your ionic components but still keep
your iron at one code yes I mean so
that's a good thing I mean by the time
we hit this or meiotic for stage the
folks at iron at wand I mean that are
currently on and everyone can be excited
about that so that's a good thing
definitely yeah so we're talking about
stencil and we'll talk about the
benefits of stencil but we haven't
really looked at how people can get
started writing projects with stencil
and writing their own components and
maybe it wants to write their own
component so maybe we can ask a few
questions here how does somebody like me
I've run my own components how do I get
it out there for people to use is it
simply put it on github is there a list
or a list is there a site or anything
like that it's definitely you thinking
about yes so just how can we get started
yep so you can go to stencil Jess comm
so actually yes done so jess calm if you
go there we have a getting started
button you can click on that and it gets
you started using stencil we also have
starters and that you know the starters
are mentioned in the end the stencil
site so I should say so stencil like I
said it's a web component compiler it
allows you to build web components that
have cool things like virtual Dom async
rendering data binding type script JSX
etc all built in it's super tiny the
code that gets output is just standard
like you know JavaScript custom elements
code so you can do you can do cool
things with it so you can build
components that you can share around so
like I said you get you get started with
the stencil component starter you build
your component then you can put that on
NPM and people can either just use a
script tag and use like a CDN to get a
hold of it or they can install it and
then just you know script tag from
wherever they installed it into their
app we also have a if you go to stencil
J's calm and our Docs you can go down
you can see like angular integration
which kind of goes through like how
you would pull in web components built
with stencil into an angular app we're
working on making that those stocks a
little bit more generic so that you can
you know it shows how to pull them into
like react app or something like that
something that may have like a really
custom wetback config and you know has
special places where you need to put
like a build directory where the file
should go etc but yet it's usually just
as easy as MPM install whatever you know
component you want to use and then you
can just copy those to your build
directory and then just link to the
domain loader file so that's that yeah
that's kind of how you just you can
build components and then yeah you put
them on NPM and people can use them
there's also an awesome stencil
collection on on a github so if you just
type in I think it's awesome stencil GS
on on github you'll see it there's a lot
of cool projects that people have built
with stencil on there so for example
there's web shear API a component that
wraps the WebSphere API there's
components that I show you the pride the
prices of popular crypto currencies if
you're into like Bitcoin and stuff and
yeah it's it's pretty cool and you can
definitely put your stuff on there and
yeah that that's building components
with it the other kind of cool thing
that we're going to be pushing in the
next few months is actually building a
whole apps with stencil so if you want
to go all in a web components so say you
have like a new project or something
especially if it's a PWA where
performance is very very critical you
can actually build a whole app with the
web components using stencil so we have
like a stencil router that way you can
have grouting in the app we have a
stencil app sorter actually that has
like the router built in it has some
examples of how to use the router etc
and the code it's kind of like the ionic
you know ionic angular blink starter but
it's a but it's it's using stencil and
yeah that shows you how you can build
whole apps using stencil and that that's
gonna give you you know if you if you do
if you want to go all-in on web
components that's going to give you
really blazing fast performance low a
slow time and runtime I've been kind of
throwing around the idea of like a ionic
PWA toolkit which is the stencil apps
for the logic ionic core for the UI so
you get all the nice ionic components
and then I'm something that we just
released on the ionic show Friday which
is ionic PWA hosting which is a zero
config best practices built-in click a
button and your app is deployed hosting
service so yeah that that way you can go
from zero to 100 build a PWA from start
and scratch it's fast it's easy all the
best practice there's a built in you
don't have to configure anything you
don't have to worry about how you're
importing stuff etc it's just fast by
default it sounds quite exciting so
effectively what you're saying is that
we have the sort of web component
compiler we write these things in TSX
so this is typescript and and
effectively what ends up happening is it
compiles down to just a native web
component we can just pull it and any
sort project we want so if we're
building just a normal JavaScript
project we can we can use that as like
great yeah that's exactly correct so
because of the awesomeness of web
components pop a script tag in and
you're using your component yeah that's
awesome so there must be a catch though
there must be a catch is there any
reason somebody would not want to use
web components or is it literally just
you know what you just gotta get with
the times um yes I mean I've talked to
this about two people before like so if
you're considering you know starting to
do a new app write a new PWA first of
all you need to look at so do you have a
lot of legacy code written in a specific
framework so if you have like a lot of
legacy code built in you know angularjs
or something like that do you have the
engineering time if you do want to go
all in a web components support that
stuff if you don't then you shouldn't do
it I mean if you know you don't have the
time of the money you don't you know
it's it's it's you know it's not there
and if you or if you another good reason
to if you rely on like a heavy have rely
heavily on a feature specific to a
certain framework so I'm say that you
rely heavily on like observables or
something like that
in angular or or I don't know some some
other specific features like dependency
injection or something like that
that's specific to a specific framework
then you know it might be better for you
to just stick with that framework
that's certainly cool and the cool thing
is you can still use you know web
components that you build sense or in
that framework yes I would kiss you you
can tape the components so you write
with sin so I'll just put them in that
framework any work on you I mean that's
that's one exactly that's what exactly
yes so in that that's totally cool you
can use that framework or you know if
you if you don't have a lot of legacy
code if you don't rely on some you know
developer experience some feature thing
that one only one framework has and you
and your you know I find that it works
really well for PWAs especially or
anytime the performance is just
extremely critical did I would recommend
going you know full-on web components um
you know you're it is a little bit lower
level so you're not going to get you
know things like dependency injection
and stuff like that but I find that
ninety percent of what you need is there
you know it's written in typescript so
you get all that you know all the
goodness that typescript provides like
you know end editor code you know it
shows you exactly what's going on at
compile time or if you have a good
editor like PS code before a compile
time actually instead of a run time and
you up we use JSX so just like you
wouldn't react or something like that
you get all the benefits of JSX
so I like being able to you know embed
j/s directly into your template and you
get async rendering you get code
splitting you get lazy loading all by
default completely zero config so yeah I
would say it the catch really is if you
just rely on something very heavily that
a certain framework ass but if you you
know if you if you do that's totally
cool you can still use some stone so
components in that app that's totally
fine but uh you know if you if you want
to try it out you you want to go all in
a web components I would definitely
check out the stencil app starter if you
want to build a whole app and I think
it's pretty fun to work with yeah it
definitely sounds it definitely sounds
like it's gonna make you know it already
has but it's definitely gonna make a lot
of ways in the future so like we talked
about we talked about the sort of ionic
Peter we were hosting service and we
said that you know we can basically take
this ionic application and maybe deploy
it using then you ionic pro service that
yeah you guys are sort of pushing a lot
Lily know can you tell me about ionic
pro and
maybe you know when we look in our
applications at the moment maybe we push
them up to firebase hosting why would we
want the change from 5s or stayin to
sort of the eye on it ionic ppw we're
hosting definitely yeah so ionic pro is
our pro suite
back-end services basically that allow
you to build to build better faster
easier ionic apps so we have a lot of
services like monitoring for example
that will tell you exactly so if you
know you have an app in production do
you have monitoring turned on its going
to give you live and your your pro
console errors that are happening in
people's apps and it actually points you
directly to the line and you're type
script where the error is happening that
way you can deploy something oh there's
an error I'm seeing it's popping up in
my - I can fix it real quick and then I
could do something like deploy so deploy
is another service dynamic Pro offers
which allows you to fix your code push
it up tie on a pro hit a button that
that says deploy and you can deploy that
code in real time to people's apps so if
you have an update you don't have to
wait on the App Store you don't have to
wait on the Play Store
you can push an update live to someone's
app as long as it's on the JavaScript
side of things if it's on the native
side of things then you will still need
to do a traditional you know App Store
update but you can use deploy to
deployed live updates to your apps to
your yeah to your apps in real time so
it's services like these that Ayana Pro
offers I'm sorry I'm pro I should say is
paid we do have a free plan the free
plan is you know it's obviously limited
compared to some of the paid plans but
we find that you know if you if you have
a if you're serious about your app you
know you you you you want some of these
back-end services such as monitoring
that it's a pretty good investment and I
will say so one of the new services
we're working on is a ionic probe PWA
hosting so upfront
I love firebase hosting I think it's
great but we you know like I said
earlier we have the ionic way of doing
things which is keeping things as easy
and as simple as we can so and that's
what we've applied to I on at PWI
hosting so ionic PWA hosting base
it gives you the the best built-in
practices you know all the stuff that
you should be doing but you know might
be kind of hard to configure yourself so
like HTP to http
you know CDN etc all built in zero
config you don't have to change anything
you just hit a button and then magic
goes on behind the scenes and boom you
have a nice fast PD the PWA that's a you
know ready for people to start using and
yeah it I just find that it makes it
makes it a really simple process so you
know firebase also supports H to push
but it's a manual config and that's
totally fine if you you know if you if
you know what you're you know doing and
and you know you're comfortable setting
up HTTP push yourself but um you know
who doesn't like just pressing a button
compared to you know setting up a config
so I just find that ionic Pro PWA
hosting is nice you know as a nice
alternative to other things like
firebase hosting which are also great
products and you know it if you have a
pro account it just ties in really
nicely there's a button on your dash you
press the button and boom it you know
it's ready to go yeah I mean that's one
of the things I mean like like you said
it yourself with regards to ionic it's
just about keeping things simple just so
that people can get on board quickly can
be building applications that they want
to build and not really have to worry
about infrastructure exactly but when
you say like automated sort of
deployment and that's everything but
when you say sort of easy to configure
and stuff it will we is the developer
have the ability to configure that
ourselves if we want to yep so that's
actually what we we planned out this
morning so we will you know so let me go
into the technical details a little bit
here so when I say best practices I'm
talking about stuff like H to push for
example so by default this stencil
compiler will output a config file that
ionic probe will look at and say okay
these are the files that need to be
pushed to get the best load time on
first view and it will go ahead and set
up auto set up that correct headers for
you and make sure that those files are
being pushed but say that you want to
customize that or say you want to put
you know some custom cache rules or
something like that and your config
that's also going to be totally possible
you can set that up yourself it'll just
be a JSON config file just like a
firebase JSON config file and yeah you
can completely customize it if you want
to or if you just you know just just
want to get a nice fast PW out there you
don't really need to configure anything
then you don't have to it's you know
zero config needed 100 100 % config if
you want to Billy first to sort of
deploy or whatever you want to do and
it's already got like sort of the best
path practices best in then then you're
good to go
yep so when it comes to ionics and
exhaustion in the chat there will the
free version of ionic be always
available forever so well I honor always
have this or yeah the open-source
version oh yeah yeah so the the Open
Source ionic framework all of our open
source tools stencil is open source
there's will always be open source we
are at heart an open source company you
you know you do have to make money
making money so you know pay services
are nice but all of our open source
stuff will always be will always be open
source and and you know they're for
anyone to use and you don't you know you
don't have to use any diner pro services
if you don't want to
we just find that you know it provides
some nice things to help you build an
awesome app so yeah all of our open
source stuff will always be open source
that well that will never change let's
give this good news so tell me a little
bit about the ionic database then I
remember he's in that back you think was
I think was a month ago no it was in
beta did that not pan out is there
something you looking to do again at the
future maybe with the own a pro movement
or is it something that you just leaving
other people to sort of champion yeah
that is deprecated it's we're not going
forward with that we found that you know
up against something like um you know
firebase has an awesome database that
the real-time database and now they have
fire store which I played with over the
weekend it's pretty cool you know we
found that we just you know what our
product didn't really offer anything
that was different than theirs so we
decided to move our resources elsewhere
to things like monitoring and
view and etc deploy all that good stuff
I'm see yeah that's deprecated and it's
not in the end the plan to bring that
back anytime soon
yeah I mean as opposed it is hard when
you sort of you're trying to compete
with these big guys who are literally
just focusing on having like the perfect
database with three operations you know
me oh yeah oh yeah and you know and
Bruce start up right like British yeah
yeah exactly that's the thing I mean so
it's one of those things but I think I
like the idea of them I really like the
idea of pushing the Davis how is this or
bit of product seen how it works seen
whether you can compete and if you can't
just simply send look it's it's
deprecated you know if you use this in
production well we said it was in bitter
you know he said you know but yeah so
we're gonna know the question what do
you think about testing in ionic is it
necessary are you working on an
out-of-the-box solution
I'm definitely so so there is a starter
and there's a bunch of community LED
products around this too like Josh he
put together I'm Joshua Moroni he put
together a very nice some ionic testing
starter it is something that we could
probably build in by default a little
bit more but yeah there's testing
solutions out there I would just um you
know look at Joshua maroney's blog he's
got a blog on there and then if you'd
look in our starters there's a starter
repo on the ionic repo or ionic
organizational gab you can you can see
the the testing starter there and that
allows you to you know to test your
ionic apps is it necessary I would say
that you know that just depends on your
team and how you're developing really um
a lot of teams are moving towards a more
am you know test-driven development
where you write a bunch of tests and
then you you know develop and make sure
that there's you know you develop to get
those tests passing basically so you set
up all these tests you do what you want
to happen and then you develop to get
those tests to pass I think that's
pretty cool but I'm you know I've
written plenty of apps that have
absolutely zero unit tests so it really
just depends on you know depends on your
setup and your team or you know what
what you're wanting to do you know I've
been there myself projects well we have
no test
and you know it's stringing together the
best project we can because you know
you've always gotta say to yourself in
this stance you know if you say well I
don't have time for tests then the
answer to that is well you know
properties you have a worse end product
that you spend more time fixing their
egos got this tug of war half night
between you and and the sort of should I
test I think it's about sort of
understanding how like what things to
unit test what's really important what
things yep
that you really need to test and what
things maybe you don't and what you
could of course you know put your
resources elsewhere I mean you're very
absolutely rude yeah that the red green
reflect this type thing is is a good
methodology I like that but yeah I think
josh has a decent repo of so I would
definitely check that for gain started
with actually integrating tests to ionic
projects and it's something I need to
look at as far as actually making a
video on it and that sort of thing and
yes I mean I could definitely do I mean
I've been using wallaby lately quite a
bit and that'll a nice to sort of
automatically see the results of our
tests inside of V s cords that's
something I recall I definitely
recommend if you enter that so we are
getting on to other things I'd like to
talk about such as avocado which so but
but we have a question before that
brandy any idea if ionic v4 will still
have its own CLI or just leave it to the
desired framework for scaffolding /a see
like I suppose this is a really
important question because you kind of
say I'm like hey how do we integrate ion
again to all of these other different
frameworks but at the same time have a
CLI which is easy to use and and sort of
scales across that can you tell me a
little bit of that yeah so this is also
also first just hey Alex I I've see Alex
for all the time around the stencils
like etc so yeah that's a really good
question it's something that honestly
we're still thinking a little bit about
so I'm so at this moment ionic v4 which
I'm guessing so I actually let me back
up a touch so ionic angular v4 will
definitely still use the ionic CLI that
you are already using but um ionic core
that is just a you know NPM packages to
collection web components so
it doesn't really make sense to have a
CLI around that since it's just an NPM
package but if you want to use like
ionic or so you know that all those I
out of components in another app are
thinking on it now is that you should
just use whatever you know CLI that
framework has so like you know react
they have a you know create react app
which is a great CLI it's it sets up a
very nice um very nice you know react
app for you it handles all that web web
pack config stuff for you and yeah
alright that's our thinking right now is
you should just use whatever the the
framework the framework your framework
of choices provides also the VC like
abuse alized
is freaking awesome so yeah it's that's
just what we're thinking now is if you
want to use ionic or you want to have
those ionic components and like your
view up you should just use the view CLI
and I've been playing around with a you
know creating like a template for the
view CLI to where you install you know
view start or whatever the command is to
start and do app with the view CLI and
you can choose the ionic template which
will already have the ionic components
you know built-in so yeah it's it's
we're still thinking about it but that
sort of thinking currently is that you
should just use whatever CLI your
framework provides yeah I think it's
good because I mean the view CLI itself
I think you can point it essentially
it's or github using them and repo I
think so you know you could basically do
ionic / ionic starter and it's just
built Marty we integrated with the the
view CLI so yeah it is this good
question and I really don't this one
that I suppose you could have an answer
for where you go and develop your own
solution exactly yep Chauhan or maybe
but if you're trying to help this sort
of this idea of hey we just develop
these components once and they sort of
run everywhere you know you're always
gonna have let yeh again we'll use the
tuber for example of you know we always
have we want to serve everybody but the
same sense you have to sort of put your
resources in an area which makes sense
for everybody if that makes sense
exactly yeah yeah I totally agree and
yeah like I mean it's you know all this
stuff is still beta so we're still
thinking about it but it is we are
pretty pretty decided on a lot of this
stuff but you know it's it's you know it
could always change for sure yeah of
course and that's what it's about
Before we jump into talking about other
things you don't have one other question
which I did miss that was what about
connecting stencil components to data
versus is this something that we leave
the application to do and we maybe use
the stencil component is this old
presentational component or can we just
is it okay to just have HTTP calls
inside of the component yeah sort of
methodology about about going around
that yes so so like I said before so you
can build whole app so it's stencil
right so you can use a stencil app
starter and build a whole app so I'm a
fan of firebase for the database stuff
especially firestore and you know
stencil web components or just like an
angular component where you can do HTTP
calls you can you know call out the
firebase excetera inside the component
you can do the same thing with web
components so I've just been using the
firebase JavaScript SDK sorry about the
Select notification there
yeah firebase JavaScript SDK to to you
know make calls out the firestore etc
and I find that works very well and you
can also do you know Fitch calls just
like you can in any like an angular
frame or an angular component or
anything like that so yeah you can
totally call up to a database I would
love if like so polymer has like the
polymer firebase components that kind of
wraps the fire busy but api's if someone
wants to wrap the for every CPI's with
stencil that would also be really cool
too but the cool thing is at the end of
the gray at the end of the day it's just
JavaScript so you can totally you know
you can call up to whatever database you
can make fetch calls to any API etc
anything you could do on the web you can
do in a in a web component yes I mean
that's the thing about web components
isn't that we can just sort of develop
these entire applications with them we
could even make our own let private NPM
repositories as an organization and I
have too much and if we're a big
organization and we have some sort of
design components that maybe we will
tease buttons or input forms or anything
like that we can almost make our what we
can make our an anti UI library and just
basically have it to ourselves which if
we have a subset so maybe we use them
like squads as an example we have this
team over here that is using view this
other team that's
in reality they don't have to conform to
whatever framework ionic uses in this
circumstance or stencil or anything that
we use because web components exactly
exactly so that's the benefit yes yep I
definitely definitely agree um and I
think you point out a really cool use
guys for web components right so I've
talked with multiple big teams that are
working in big corporations and they all
you know there may be like five
different teams within this corporation
and everybody's using a different
framework right so you have one team
this using angular you have one team
that's using react you have one team
that's maybe using like jQuery or
something like that and they're all
writing the same components right so
like you're writing a date-time in
angular and then once he was writing a
date time and in react so one cool thing
that web components allows you to do and
one use case I think is freaking awesome
is you build one web component that is
the date/time component you can send
that off to your design team they can
design it for you and then you know that
design is going to be you know specific
to your you know corporations design
plan or you know design guidelines and
it's gonna look the same at each each
framework and then you know instead of
everybody writing their own components
you write one component and then
everybody can share it and like I said
you know the design is gonna be right on
no matter what you know the team is
using and it cuts down on you know it
cuts down on code what's the word I'm
looking for code or effort everybody's
time yeah application yeah everybody's
spending the time doing the same thing
when really you could just build one
component and everybody use it yeah
that's a really good point and I think
you know how many times is that same
button component being developed or how
many times has done same exact say
autocomplete is an example if we take
all completed Zagat of I bet like we get
thousands of examples you know agree and
that's the thing I mean like your
company just needs to make this want to
almost feels like cheating of you if you
think about it almost feels like hey you
know we've got we've got so much ours
and it's or productivity I was back
because you know all these teams have
one language to communicate and it's not
just JavaScript it's literally just the
component level itself
you know they came back they can write
one stencil component it's compatible
with everything get a sink Lords you
know everything we have sons expected
yep exactly
yeah that's awesome yeah so so hope more
people do you sense Allah no more people
do I'm trying I'm gonna make lots I'm
gonna make some videos about I'm gonna
make hopefully a course on it and
awesome just try and get the word on
there because it is really an
interesting sort of compiler yeah thank
you we get to other things like avocado
which was mentioned briefly yesterday in
the or the other day whenever it was in
the ionic idea Friday yep so tell me a
little bit about a little bit about that
and tell me how it sort of fits into the
ionic in Cordova ecosystem like at the
moment if I want to interact with a
native API I have to write it called
doraville plugin i have to sort of
interact with cordova yeah what is what
you trying to achieve in the future
regarding that definitely um so I will
say warning it is very very early for
avocado so I'm not gonna dive into too
many details just because those details
are still being fleshed out so I don't
you know I it's exactly so I you know
anything that I say today it's possible
that I could change tomorrow because
it's very early but basically the the
the concept around avocado is first of
all it's not we're not you know Cordova
is great obviously people have built
tons of stuff on it so it's you know
it's not like a you know it korto is
totally cool but we like I said before I
keep saying it like we're doing things
to ionic way right and like I said it's
the ionic way to be is making things as
easy as possible so avocados just kind
of extends that to this native player
integration so as you people probably
know Cordova allows you to interact with
native functionality on the device from
JavaScript and Cordova also allows you
to build at what you know a native app
an APK or an IPA on iOS that you can
then ship to the App Store Play Store so
avocado allows you to do those same
things but with some key differences so
first is if we're kind of going back to
the old school fire or PhoneGap days
where
we're you know embracing things like
Android studio and Xcode so instead of I
find that in computer science a lot you
can abstract things away so to the point
where things are so abstracted that
first if something breaks it's it's in
so many layers of abstraction that it's
actually either like hard to find where
the actual issue is happening and and
and also that you know you can have to
abstract things away to the point where
it actually becomes harder because
there's so many abstractions that you
didn't have to learn to make something
work when if maybe it was a little less
abstracted away it would be easier to
use because there's just less to know so
we're we're we're kind of you know
taking some of the things that we
learned about Cordova and and tweaking
them to be more than acquiesce so we're
making things simpler we're we're gonna
have a nice consistent API between the
native side and the JavaScript side to
make it easy for you know a developer
who may not have written native code
before to be able to write you know a
plugin that interacts with something on
the native side and we're also gonna
have a really nice JavaScript SDK on the
on the website of things that allows you
to call into these plugins it's
obviously still gonna be a webview you
know where I on ik is based on the web
so we'll still be using like chrome
webview on Android and WK webview on iOS
but we're just modernizing things we're
making things more you know Diana Quay
and I think it's gonna be pretty cool
and there's some other key things too so
like we're moving because we're kind of
simplifying things we're also making it
so traditionally if you have a quart of
app and you decide that you want to
deploy that Cordova app as a PW a
traditionally as it sits now you have to
make a few changes to your code you have
to do some feature detection to say hey
in my own Cordova or hey am I on the web
if so do this so do that we are making
that way simpler to where you write one
API and the mi on the native side or am
I on the JavaScript side or are on the
website is handled by the by avocado
itself and so yeah that way you can
easily or more easily ship your your
Cordova app as a PWA and there's some
the cool things I could keep going on
but uh there's cool things like so on
the native side if you want you know if
your app is running as a Cordova app or
as a native app you can say hey I want
to you know maybe I want to use the
native alert and you can you can you
know like I said write that one API and
it'll show the native Lert on on a
native app and a web you know as their
traditional ionic alert that you're
gonna do and love on the web side of
things
yeah it's it's I mean I could go on for
days but it's basically just taking
taking the native layer that has always
been there and you know ionic apps that
were shipped to the Play Store app store
and just making it more making it follow
the ionic way pretty much yeah you've
been a really good point there with the
sort of you know on iOS or Android
device will show that in the evelope but
on the web will show the maybe ionic a
lot so that gives us like so much more
flexibility there because I imagine we
can then make a PW where we can make
electro knots this way we can make ionic
ops that's where in all using that same
technology exactly exactly so it allows
us maybe we're a big enterprise and we
want to sort of have this one product we
can deploy that pretty much everywhere
and we don't really have to worry as
much about calling platform got ready or
I mean oh so I think if I can not
available up here somewhere
exactly so that does seem like it's
gonna be a really big thing yeah
definitely and I also one thing that I
forgot to is so a lot of those we looked
at kind of like the core could have a
plugins that people use pretty
consistently in every app so something
like the keyboard plug-in for example
that's used in basically every app built
with Cordova out there currently so with
ionic you know we do install it by
default but in a traditional just like
vanilla CRO app it's you know something
that you have to install even though
it's very important to a good experience
in a chrome app it is something it's
it's not built-in so one of the cool
things we're doing with a with avocado
is those core plugins there's like 10 10
11 core plugins that we know people
pretty much always use we're just
building that in by default so you don't
even have to worry about installing the
plug-in or anything like that those core
plugins that you are you know this core
native functionalities that you're
always looking for are just gonna be
built in by default nothing to install
or anything like that it's just already
there yes I think it's like it's so much
puff that gets a little it's a lot of
power too because you know when we sort
of making our angular applications on
ionic ups at the moment in our providers
we have things like status bar we have
things like stuff about which attorney
developer I mean I'm not sure whether
they would still exist maybe in this or
Vava card or a solution but to a new
developer you know haven't seen these
things automatically in our providers or
imports or anything like that you know
it can become can be scary you know so I
think the more obstruction you can make
to make things easy by default and then
if somebody wants to dive into these
things and wants to sort of you know
deal with the need of interaction they
can I think that's really good for the
the sort of standard developer that's
looking to take advantage of stuff with
ionic yep that's what we're trying to do
it's a very good cool I'm completely on
board that so Alex asks us a question
with avocado when you update anything
non-web the binary I assume will change
so you will lose hot posh which
essentially means we have to you know
push that to the App Store is that
correct yes so that that's actually
correct with the Cordova as it stands
out too so ionic deploy it only works if
you're only making JavaScript HTML CSS
side changes so you can't actually do a
deploy if you make any changes on the
native side of things and this is for
security reasons and also so you don't
get you don't face Apple's Fury so what
yeah exactly
so yeah you can only do a deploy if it's
a JavaScript CSS or HTML side change and
that's not an avocado thing that's also
true today with Cordova sure and this
was people don't really have to wit
because they use I on it they don't have
to be scared about this new templating
burn bionic by Apple sorry yeah exactly
because that's thing a lot of people
have been asking me to this in like hey
well you know we use a thing that's not
the apples at stake here is ionic still
gonna be fine with that and oh yes oh
yes of course
oh yeah ya know at we're and actually if
you look at so apple just released a few
days ago there are top apps for 2017 and
I'm they're actually two
apps on their their ability onyx or
Pacifica which is like if you have like
anxiety or stress issues you can use it
allows you to do tells you you know
different coping strategies etc it kind
of walks you through them and then also
work it which is a an exercise app I
could probably stand to use to work it
it's a it's a very cool app and it's
built with ionic and it's one of the top
apps on the App Store so I should be
clear you know ionic is not it's not a
template app a template app is something
that you install this are you download
this you know native app that's that is
basically pre-built for you it's a very
you know standard design and did you
just put some content and it basically
ionic is not that ionic is a you know a
framework that allows you to build an
app from scratch true there are
templates that you can install and you
know pre-built like you know ionic
templates and or ionic like on the ionic
marketplace and stuff like that but
that's still at the core not a template
app it's not a pre-built native app that
you know looks very generic compared to
to you know it looks very so yeah so
neither there's no no issues ionic is
not a template app it's a it's a
framework that allows you to build
mobile apps or web apps I should say
well that's good so you know I mean it's
just one of those things I mean people I
suppose have always been dubious of you
know that just--they because I think
wasn't there something ages ago I think
with Apple were with html5 out still
getting declined quite often I don't
remember that specific case it's
possible that's my pressure yeah I'm not
sure what criteria it was for perhaps
people just won using that design
guidelines and that's maybe why you know
but but yeah but I think it's just one
of those things whenever you're not
using the native SDK people always can
get a little bit scared that perhaps you
know what they're using doesn't fit with
these stats core of the store because I
suppose you know that as far as they're
concerned they do have the right to just
sort of you know declare a ban on html5
apps if they wanted so yeah yeah no
definitely for sure and in the code I
mean the thing to remember too is like
you can use the iOS SDK to build an app
and if it's not up to Apple standards
you'll still get declined even though
yours
their technology so it all comes down
that you know just making sure you
follow their roles and you know I have a
big PWA fans so if you don't want to you
know get declined by Apple you can
anybody can pushing things at the web
stencil I think that's pretty much it
unless anybody else has any more
questions I mean I think we found out
definitely a lot about the ionic project
we found a lot stencil and especially
ionic the basalt company and overall
goals at the future where you guys want
to go and I definitely on board with
that I think that's awesome
somebody has said where Rashid has said
their where's the best AdMob ads
placements in anionic okay yes sir
this is actually a really good question
um so so in a native app it doesn't
really matter as much but so I'm a huge
PWA fan and on pwace it really matters
because honestly ads pull in a lot of
JavaScript and that's gonna really
impact not only your first time to load
but you know some buttons data plan for
example so you know a lot of people are
a lot of places where pwace are really
big data is really expensive and you
don't want to be pushing a ton of ads
that just takes up someone's data plan
you know loading like three different
versions of jQuery or something and
blowing up someone's data plan so I find
that the best best it even on the native
side too even if you're you know it
pushing a or Cordova app to the Play
Store I find that if you can lazy load
ads that that's gonna be your best bet
so like on the web there's a cool API
called um intersection observer so this
allows you to basically say from from a
very basic standpoint hey don't run this
code until the user has scrolled to
where it's actually in their pport so
I've used this in some pwace before I
put ads maybe down towards the bottom of
a list or something like that and then I
use interception observer to say hey
don't blow the JavaScript for that ad
until the user has actually scrolled
over it that way if they never scroll
over it and they made ever make it to
the bottom of the list then they don't
you know they don't have to load that
JavaScript so yeah if you can if you can
uh if you can
yeah if you can optimize that I think
it's really if you can optimize that
definitely you should ads pulling a lot
of our code so I'm you should definitely
try to optimize it possible yeah I
suppose done the same thing when you you
sort of making PWS as well well we sort
of want to make sure that like images
are a big deal in a beta where I guess
you know because you got some compressed
images or maybe you load a lot of images
you know you can imagine just how much
of a difference it makes the a bundle
like so you might have this you know
super quick up but you know it's it's
lazy loading the images is a really
important thing to yep
and actually I have a web component that
I built stencil called st - image and
that actually uses the interception
reserver to lazy load images so you
should check it out that's a relatively
new API I think isn't it got a decent
support it's relatively new it has been
out for a little while let me actually I
can pull it up in can I use reflexively
the the support is actually pretty
decent so let me pull it up here yeah so
we have support nom edge Firefox Chrome
looks like the only flux Samsung
internet supports it looks like the two
browsers missing out is Safari and ie
but yeah it looks like Safari and ie but
the cool thing is so like st image so
actually this is a slight tangent but
it's I think it's important um so Safari
pretty much only runs when you think
about it Safari pretty much only runs on
really high-end devices right so I'm
like an iPhone 10 for example that has a
better CPU than my surface book that I
used as a better CPU than like you know
it's it's an insane few so I think you
can get away with you know loading you
know bigger images and stuff like that
not lazy loading images on and on a you
know a device that runs Safari more than
you can advise you know that's something
that runs to Chrome or Firefox because
you know chrome runs on everything from
you know $100
you know Android phones that are a
really experience for the cost or you
know 800 something dollar pixel - so
yeah so even though Safari doesn't
support it like an SD image I just do
some features support detection
and then I just say hey if it's if it's
not supported just go ahead and load the
image if you send that iOS and probably
edge don't support it then you know you
probably not in the worst situation at
that point exactly and actually it looks
like edge supports a distrust ie
yeah and ie doesn't really support
anything so so just another quit when I
suppose while we're talking about Peter
waves and performance cuz I know you're
really into this and when it comes to
running sort of these lower end devices
so we are on what these hundred-dollar
Android phones here Peter Weir's have to
be really important for that as surely
oh yeah no do that for sure
so this is actually you'll you know hear
me talk about this on Twitter all the
time
so here in the US where we're really um
it's it's really cool that the majority
of people and this may be a
generalization and I don't mean into but
you know a lot of people have really
nice devices they have really cheap data
plans and they're a lot of people just
have Wi-Fi so I'm on Wi-Fi like 90% of
the time so I I don't spend barely
anything on my data plan but we got to
remember you know outside of our you
know developer bubble a lot of people
don't have those so a lot of people
don't have you know access to Wi-Fi and
a lot of people don't have you know an
$800 pixel - and and you know unlimited
data and stuff like this you know a lot
of people have $100 you know moto G or
moto e they might have a few gigs of
data and you know the storage on that
device is just a couple of gigs the RAM
is one gig of ram you know the CPU is a
lower-end Snapdragon CPU and that when
you look at the specs that's a verb when
you look at the stats that's actually
the average device that runs Android the
average device that runs Android has 1
gig of ram and a came over the exact
like CPU clock but it's a very you know
very slow CPU by what you know we
consider modern standards and and when
you build experiences so the web runs
everywhere and it runs on those devices
just like it runs on a pixel - you want
your Xperia
to be able to be used by anybody and you
know I'm totally guilty of this for a
long time I did most of my testing on
high-end Nexus devices right and hey my
app works fine on my device but when
somebody when someone you know when
someone tries to pull it up on the
average Android device it might be
extremely slow or it might be you know
just hammering the CPU or it might be
hammering the network stack and you know
at the end of the day I just think
that's it's kind of unfair right so yeah
I always I always push people I'm you
know and that's one of the driving goals
behind like pwace so pwace on average
use much less storage and a native app
what do you think like the the apk for
facebook is like 40 something megabytes
with the web version pulls in like you
know 40 something kilobytes that's it
that's a huge difference and then you
know you know the native app is going to
be using tons of ram etc compared to the
PWA and it's yeah so that that's PW azor
our big deal when you have you know a
lower end device like that because it's
it's going to be more sensitive to your
data plan it's going to be more
sensitive to your storage etc and just
while I'm on this on this I should say
they're like if you can always try to
test on a lower end device because you
know if you're testing on your back
perper that you have a work a backpack
pro can turn through tons of JavaScript
compared it to a mobile device so you
should definitely always try to test on
the lowest device you can I have a first
generation moto G that I do as you know
I do a ton of testing on everything that
I built especially pway is always get
tested on that phone and you know it the
cool thing is if you can optimize to be
fast on a first generation moto G then
if you pull out your pixel - it's gonna
be blazing fast so it's yeah it's it's
very important I think it's a yeah
always test your stuff on an actual
mobile device yeah that's really
important and it's something I've
thought well in the past and I've
definitely considered and I've worked
with a lot of the things that you speak
with so for example in the past we were
deploying this crime management
application up to these tablets that we
had to work and you can imagine when
you're a public organization
such as a police force you don't really
get iPads you know you don't really have
sort of balance which you can spend a
lot of money on so we had these all
exact Sun tablets and was the ear
something or gentleman is one of the the
rugged work device ones and I didn't all
this like it I mean this is angular GS
and I own at one point X at this point
but I don't notice that like the
performance when we did run out on an
iPod or more we did run out on a
higher-end device would would
substantially change and it's like it's
something you can eat it for granted
because I think we as developers often
thing like hey we're able to deploy for
Android and iOS and that's our thing so
everybody has the same experience right
because everybody has the same
experience I saw what's easy to think
and I think unless you've really are
unless you really do have like the sort
of and when you wanna be so ghetto and
use console time or whether you want
unless you're all really tracking that
performance benchmarks and you really
enter that I think you can easily take
that for granted where you don't before
you way you don't literally focus on
that so it is really important and I do
think projects like stencil when you are
talking about lazy loading and isn't
rendering all these different things
that is gonna help push the boundary so
that more and more people can just get
up by default
exactly yeah that is the whole point
behind stencil is that default so that
you know and it's it sounds kind of
funny but a lot of people like it
doesn't really cross your mind right to
test on a mobile device because like
even with ionic you do ionic serve your
billing your app it's running really
fast on your on your MacBook Pro and you
know to you it's a good experience but
then you you know you deploy that to a
moto G and it's just good it could be
entirely different yeah and that's not
really yours as the developers fault
when really if we if we have better
defaults then it would be easy so that's
that's the whole like point of like
moving to stencil and stuff like that is
that the defaults that you you know
should be doing but you know it's that
you should be doing artist built in by
default that way you don't have to think
about it and you have a better chance of
like you know developing the app and you
install it on your or you you know use
it on your moto G and it's probably
going to be fast out of the box yeah
really important we have a question in
the chat about UC browser well yeah so
do you see browser and that approach yes
so I'm you see browser so I I just read
that they released a PW a support
I think that's freaking awesome so
apparently they have add to homescreen
now they have service workers push
notifications et cetera I think that's
awesome and you know it's just one more
browser that you can install on an
Android device that has a you know PWA
support I can't say that I probably
should honestly because I know it's used
by a lot of people especially in China I
should probably test more on UC browser
but as far as I know at least the
Android version has pretty good html5
support and obviously they have service
workers now too so yeah I think that's
great yeah I think it won't be long
until everybody's support so I think
there is an initiative with Safari to of
course support service workers and get
that space of implemented in mind so I
think once we have like a hundred
percent support and that's was in it's a
lot of this or a discussion it revolves
around this too isn't it well like it
doesn't matter that iOS doesn't support
service workers because he should be
implement and the principles of service
workers and the principles of the fast
web anywhere you know means if like it
doesn't matter like so you shouldn't
just like right off serves what goes
because Safari doesn't sort of implement
that oh yeah no I totally agree um so
this is one thing I always like to say
too like so Safari just to be clear is
implementing service workers it's in
technical preview right now so far a
technical preview it's it's it's not
totally there it's still still broken
they're still working on it though so I
wouldn't expect it to be totally totally
there yet but it is coming and they're
moving pretty fast on it from what I can
tell but in the meantime yeah like you
said Paul like it's you know
serviceworker does provide you you know
cool functionality like push
notifications dynamic hashing etc but
you don't need a serviceworker
particularly to build a good web
experience like you can still if you
follow best practices of like not
loading tons of javascript up front you
know having compressed images lazy
loading those images potentially I met
cetera you can still build a really nice
web experience on an iOS device that
that runs fast and works great so I'm I
for I recommend like if you have an
iPhone go to what Twitter comm or
Pinterest com those are pwace I get push
notifications from Twitter on you know
the Twitter like the PWA person on my
Android device but you can pull it up on
an iPhone and it's still a really great
web app and the you know one of the
words in progressive web apps is
progressive so you know what that word
means that you know as as the app if the
app runs on a device the has certain
functionality then you can kind of
upgrade that user to get that
functionality so like if you pull a
Twitter light up on an Android device
that you can opt-in to push
notifications and then on a device or a
browser that doesn't support you know
service workers and push notifications
then you simply just you know degrade
gracefully and you don't give them that
option but you still get them you know
the rest of the functionality of the app
and I think that's pretty cool because
then like as Safari does support service
workers then when Safari ships that
support then people who build or people
use Twitter Twitter light on an iOS
device will you know immediately get
that support that's pretty cool yeah and
I think people I mean if you look at
using to a light and the experience is
super quick in comparison to the name of
anyway like exactly and I think this is
the thing is that it's kind of where
like you know people are paying a bit
more attention now to or at least it
should be following this sort of
progressive web app guidelines to
performance and really making sure that
we have good web experiences because you
know for the longest time if you
consider JavaScript just to sort of give
this client side like so language that
lets us make alerts you know it's much
different now I think the the sort of
the ecosystem and the landscape is is
very much different yep definitely yeah
I totally agree um you know I
progressive about it's a it's a good
like marketing like naming thing but
really I mean all it all it means is
that you should be like you know you
should strive to create like the best
web app experience that you can and make
sure that it works for everybody and not
just on a MacBook Pro yeah and easily
and a lot of things when you go start to
try and implement these guidelines you
find out that actually a lot of the work
that you're doing doesn't necessarily
have to be in the service worker you
know exact time you asked do a network
profile and you wanna start looking at
the times the Lord you asked look like
looking at year time to our interactive
you doodle of work which you know at the
end of the day comes down to design
decisions that you make as it sort of as
a sort of developer exactly so when we
talk about testing on all these
different devices and we have a model of
gee we've got an iPhone 10
I heard there's an ionic app that helps
us with that and it's not gonna give you
good plug good player like that so yeah
we just recently announced this was a
couple of weeks ago now the ionic dev
app so yeah so iron whew a lot of people
actually used to use ionic view for this
use case so ionic view as an app that
allows you to so you can like push an
app that you're working on up to up to
ionic pro and then you can share that
app using view so one good use case that
I find is like if I'm back when I
freelanced I could use ionic feel like I
could build an app and then use ionic
views to share that to my you know
client that I was working for and that
they could not just you know not looking
at screenshots and stuff like that but
they could actually use the app right
there and they could tell me like hey
you know I don't like the color of this
button or if you push this button this
should happen or something like that so
ionic to you is perfect for that but we
found that a lot of people we're trying
to use ionic view for native development
so you know you start using Cordova
plugins they only work on a phone
instead of the old you know ionic you
know run Android - prod okay something's
wrong let me to make some changes ionic
whatever run Android again that's not
the you know the fastest you know that's
that's not the fastest way to dev for
sure so we built this thing called ionic
dev app so what the ionic dev app does
is you install it to your phone it's
it's out there on the Play Store and the
App Store you install the app to your
phone you make sure that you're on the
same network as your computer is so your
development machine you run ionic serve
and the dev app will automatically
detect that ionic serve and show show
you in the list of apps that you could
add there show you that and then you can
simply click on that that item it pulls
the app up in your pulse tap
indeed about and yeah you can start
developing so it has all the cool things
you hear from ionic serve so like live
reload
you know instant build so you make a
change you you know you hit save and
every builds for you but also how about
access to Cordova plugins so it kind of
it's it's basically like ionic view but
for app development and not really just
like app review
so yeah just quick I review I served
pull it up in the dev app click it and
then you can continue to use that that
library though development process that
you're used to but also have access to
Cordova plugins yeah it's really good
because it allows us to obviously test
that use case that we were talking about
with them all OG and the iPhone 10 and
also things exactly we can see that look
hey this device it's not really
performing very well exactly when I
click this button this animation like it
just doesn't work you know what made it
I've been there and I've been there in
the circumstance - with ionic view I've
had a client and I'm bitch they're
working freelance and I'm trying to show
the client but you know what this this
plugin doesn't work so we get the
message from the client like hey this
this kind of doesn't work but in reality
it's just this or limitation of ionic
view at that point yep so you saying
essentially I only Devon wouldn't have
that because I'm more support so it's
for select Cordova plugins again but
just a bit more yeah so okay yeah so
yeah so it's it's still you know limited
to the plugins that we have installed in
the app but we've increased the amount
of plugins that we have installed by
default tremendously and we've actually
increased the amount of plugins and I of
YouTube so we've have tried to cover all
of the the most common plugins that
people use or are you know and also not
only the most common people use but also
the ones that we have a lot of people
request so the latest version of ionic
view includes way more plugins that are
used to and I on active app includes a
ton of plugins out of the box so for and
this is probably kind of dangerous to
say but for like 95 percent of use case
I think you'll probably have the plug-in
and either dev app review yes so that's
good because I mean that I'm talking
like we're going bucket y'all saw here
when I was pretty sure did that use case
but but
that's definitely an interesting thing
and I suppose like with the only dev app
you do have the ability to of course you
know have a tablet version up and mobile
version up and any change you make it's
automatically sort of in there and
that's that's definitely great we're
definitely we have a question can I use
ionic 3 to read user fingerprint from
biometric device that's that's that's a
good question I'm not sure yeah I'm not
sure either if there's a Cordova plug in
out there then you should be able to it
probably depends on what exact device
you're talking about etc if there's not
a plug in you can always write a plug-in
for it if you're familiar with native
code but yeah it just depends on exactly
what device you're talking about and you
may have to do a little bit of googling
to see if there's a program a plug in
for it yet
when it comes to a sort of Cordova
plugins I get a lot of questions about
this in a source similar sense actually
about um how do we sort of interact with
this native API this ionic core is ionic
looking at sort of resources about how
one can go and write their own Cordova
plugin and sort of have their own native
integrations or is this just a resource
thing so we're actually looking at that
for avocado so like I like I mentioned
before we are creating one of the goals
with avocado is to make sure that it's
really easy to write plug-ins for it to
and interact with a interact with native
features that way you don't run into to
you know situations like that where this
person has a biometric device that are
trying to get a fingerprint from but
there's not a plugin out there for it
yet and you know that person may not you
know have really good Java or a really
good swift or objective-c experience so
one of the things we're looking at with
avocado is to make sure that it's really
easy to build you know access those
native features so we're you know making
sure that the the native side of things
that the SDK for that is a really good
API and I'm trying to keep it as as
similar to the JavaScript API as we can
yeah because I think that's a that is
one of the big things isn't it was you
know you're trying to make this up and
you really good
javascript and you can sort of implement
the app but maybe there's no plugin that
you need and I think that's a lot of the
edge cases where people then break down
and you know for a lot of people when
you enter on boards not necessarily I
already just just been interested in
programming in the curry itself I think
it can be a hit or a lot of eagles
confidence when they get there and they
say you know what I want to implement
this thing but you know now I've just
got on this whole other path that really
yep all I want to do is just you know
load up the camera yeah you know so I
think yeah definitely so when it comes
to sort of avocado again I'll jump back
into this and we when we're talking
about interfacing with native api's are
we talking about doing that from the
Swift and objective sea level or are we
talking about from a sort of JavaScript
intermediate tree at that point oh yeah
definitely do you not know yet um so
kind of both actually so for example
let's say that the pixel 3 comes out and
has some new feature or actually select
yeah so let the pixel 2 for example
introduce this new feature where you can
squeeze the sides of device currently
it's locked down to just open the open
our Google assistant but let's say that
you know they open up that API it's
where anybody could could could say you
know any app could say ok squeeze the
size the device and my app will do
something so let's take that example so
there's probably not a core of a plugin
out there for that yet you know that
pixel two just came out if they would
have opened up that API there may have
already been a plugin for it but you
know I kind of doubt it and you know
that that would be a use case for a lot
so a new device comes out or or you know
the next version of Android comes out
and implements this new feature etc
normally with Cordova if you didn't have
that native experience you would just
have to wait until somebody did build
that plugin and you know that that's not
exactly great when you're trying to you
know push something into production or
something like that so that's where the
the native side of avocado comes in so
we use our native SDK to be able to
interact with those api's or you know
that feature or whatever but our SDK you
know technically your writing so we have
technically writing Java
but you know we've written this SDK to
be as simple and as like close to the
JavaScript API as possible so you write
the native side of it and then you use a
actually currently it's a it's very uses
an API similar to web workers for you
post message and then you can call that
little bit of native code that you just
wrote from the JavaScript side and
because we're keeping the API is very
similar your code will look like I said
extremely similar
so yes ah the koto is like I said
normally but with Cordova you'd have to
wait on somebody who has like true like
native you know experience writing
native code and you know that you may
not be comfortable with and just waiting
on them to implement the plug-in and you
know hoping that eventually they do
implement the plugin - you know avocado
where it we have tried you know our best
to make it as easy to tap in the edited
functionality as possible so hopefully
that's a little bit of native code that
you have to write it's pretty easy for
you yeah definitely does sound
interesting I mean the that exact thing
I mean we if we take face ID is another
example you know with a different end I
mean that's a that's a feature which I'm
not sure whether there is a Cordova
plug-in available for it yet but it's
something that like if I want to
implement that on day one you know
because if imagine you've got a client
and this client is gonna be really
excited that face IDs just oh yeah yeah
sure
you know they've just got an iPhone time
themselves and they go you know what
I'll wrap needs this and you go well I
kind of just can only really run a
JavaScript and I can I've never looked
to make up my own code of a plug-in
before and this sounds like super scary
and you know I still gotta pay the
mortgage at the end of the month so but
yet but definitely so I can definitely
agree with with that sort of process
native script itself when we look at
things comparing her to ionic mm-hmm it
has them sold like Java Script API in
which we can sort of map the sort of
Swift and androids or Java functions but
written in JavaScript so we've got
typescript support with that too and ice
that's called that might be I don't know
whether it's something you've looked at
as is on your end or maybe how it
compares to sort of the view that you
guys are taken
yeah or but basically just how do you
think I only fits in with native script
I mean I don't really want to turn this
into a 90 versus nearly every day and
this is a question coarsely it's up to
you ladies
it's whatever like your project it like
whatever makes sense for your team but
yeah when I'll be definitely interested
in to sort of seeing the way that we can
interact with the native Feis and I
definitely be up for loan and mobile
that when when obviously you have more
information yeah definitely and you know
I think I think we could probably take
something from data script on that side
- right so because data script has been
so focused on the native side of things
you know there's probably some you know
some thoughts or some ideas that we can
you know take from that side and
implement into avocados and you know I
just will say like you know obviously
I'm biased towards ionic but I'm you
know I think for native scripts if
you're doing like a you know native
focused apps
I think native script is fine and you
know if native fits your fits your use
case and you know if it's what your team
wants to do then I say you should go off
for it maybe give ionic look but uh
let's you know if it fits through these
case then you should definitely be you
save scripts and I've seen some cool
stuff built with native script and said
hey if you know if ionic works for you
if you like ionic if it fits your East
Coast then you should definitely use
ionic it all just depends on what you
want to do and what you like best
something that's exactly what it's about
isn't it I think there's the it just
comes down to what you do what your
interests are and I think ionic does
offer so many components out of the box
that if you know they do offer more
components than some of the line native
script so if you wanted to have this
sort of the say checkbox for example I'm
not sure I don't think there's a
checkbox component by default in their
script but just using it as an example
we can't just pull in the chat box
because you know the end of day it's
just simply a web components or will be
in the future so like I said it's it
shouldn't be about ionic versus native
script it should it should be about how
can we learn from these projects that
are integrated with knit native it the
eyes and how can we sort of you know map
that and push us all so that also the
culture forward these sort of you know
the projects forward themselves and
that's what's what total area has the
same thing called
think of you know doesn't matter what
project you are whether you fuse were
the ionic Willy a knitter script I think
everybody's just lookin to make the the
cross-platform experience much better
yep excuse the slight language but I
always like to say that everybody's
trying to build cool right yeah it
just depends on what you want to use
exactly you know so many people that got
c-sharp teams ask me like hey you should
we learn ionic I'm well maybe but you
kind of got a c-sharp solution with
xamarin which you know it might be like
actually you know what legs amber and
it's just much better your team at that
point because everybody already knows
the language and nobody has to retrain
and you know it kind of comes down to
sort of what you want you team and I
think it's so personal to to each team
which it just becomes the way you want
that point definitely i obviously my
ways gonna tell people hey give i honest
look but uh but uh you know it's like
you said you said it perfectly it's it's
very very specific to what you or your
team is doing what you're working on you
know what you'll know if you're willing
to learn something different if you had
the time and money to learn something
different yeah it there's a lot of
factors and i think you know all
projects are cool yeah a great sort of
issue i mean ionic is something i got me
into programming when i first started i
started with early on it won't put an
exit made it in my dissertation even
like the station with firebase i in and
like i said before it's all about the
onboarding experience about you know
what like you have these components like
can get feel really interested in the
project and then they become long-term
funds and long-term users and then
eventually hopefully upgrades ionic
parole and then you know use the whole
scary go you know about that's it and
use it within their teams to deploy
projects oh they're here a quick
question here before we sort of wrap
things up with what about debunking
feature on devi' because yeah i know at
this point you know we can debug on the
device using the chrome dev tools and
stuff do we have any sort of debunk
experience when it comes to the oni
develop itself yep so this is something
we're actually actively working on I
know the pro team had a meeting about it
this morning
so it's it's a pretty challenging issue
actually so technically when you install
the dev app you are running obviously
you know the dev app itself is built
with ionic so it's running in a web view
and then you know it's loading other
apps into that webview so while the app
you're loading into that webview is is
running a development build so it would
you know spit out console logs the dev
app itself is running a production bill
so then you get into where this so you
try to inspect the output dev tools
chrome dev tools and it won't actually
let you inspect it because the the
webview or the code that it sees is
production code so it's looking at that
map itself when really what we needed to
do is to be able to look inside of that
and look at the do you know dev build
app that you're working on so like I
said it's it's a super challenging issue
way more challenging than you would
think it would be actually but it is
something that we're looking into I
would say it's you know it is a slight
limitation of the dev app now I I do
think the dev app still brings a lot to
the table but debugging is definitely
something that's like super important
we're looking into it's a pretty
challenging issue but we're working on
trying to find ways around it on Android
it definitely should be easier just
because of how awesome chrome dev tools
are and chrome inspect etc on iOS it
becomes even more of a challenging issue
just because iOS is a little bit more
lockdown and the dev tools aren't as
great at least in my opinion and don't
have as many features I should say I
guess but yeah it's definitely something
we're looking into if we do get it
working it's probably gonna come to
Android first I would imagine but we
want to get it working across iOS and
Android so we'll see yeah I imagine it's
super difficult I mean if anybody's ever
deployed sort of applications like a
mobile device management system or like
sort of enterprise level deployment
you'll know that running things in the
container is never a good thing yeah
it's never a good thing you know we
won't that we had this issue before when
we were deploying to production where we
run things like an MDM and a container
it's not like when you have a secure
Tanna that you that is literally like
encrypted and stuff it's it's almost
impossible to debug the app inside of
that yeah I can only imagine I can
imagine that you know you may be a
little easier when it's not in a secure
encrypted container and stuff but be it
but definitely it is hard I mean can't
you just like just take the chrome dev
tools put it in a stencil package but in
the app I mean yeah the dev tools inside
of the the device inside the antthony
sauce so I think there is so that that
actually isn't right so there is I don't
know it's it's funny but like there is a
way but you could like with electron
halves like run yes separately but yeah
it's it's gonna be a complex engineering
issue we'll see where it goes and yeah
hopefully we can get it out there for
people if not I would say dev app still
brings a ton to the table in might and
at my opinion and yeah hopefully we'll
have a solution and hopefully it doesn't
end up being as crazy as packaging
chrome pencils thanks Justin for the
ground sir and thanks Paul to discussion
I think we've talked about pretty much
everything again he was going on ionic
stencil and a pro avocado PWS is
anything that you would like to add is
there any questions that you would like
to sort of pause to the discussion or
are you are you I on it yeah I would say
I'm just follow me on Twitter I'm at at
Justin Willis 96 I follow up also you
can go in to his followers and find me
there you know I'm always willing to
help people if you have a question I may
not be able to get to it that day but
you know I will try my best to be able
to get to you and help you I'm also
always tweeting about some of the new
things we're working on I'm tweeting out
demos constantly etc so if you're you
know interested in ionic or stencil or
web components or just the web in
general feel free to follow me and yeah
I hope you enjoyed my feet and then I
yeah you should um yeah that's about it
follow me on Twitter and yeah hopefully
everybody's building cool stuff yeah
maybe like I said just in the
always post about pedo he was so he's
gonna if you fall in you'll have Peter
with Lord in like zero you can but yeah
definitely check it Justin's feet out
it's awesome
he's got an eye on eight can can do
stuff on there that I've seen before
built the stencil it's perfect
ionic team you some really exciting
things incoming problems just like yeah
yeah like I said I always try to get
everybody I may not get there you know I
I do
I do wear cationic I you know I do have
a DEP relations chopper at the create
content and stuff but I definitely
definitely try to help as many people as
I can it's about the broad strokes so
yeah that's it as long as you got impact
the most people let's get alright thank
you very much Justin it's been awesome
what we need is we need get you back at
some point and you can show us how to do
all the stencil stuff and we can run
through some projects together on stream
and everyone will be really good and we
can sort of you know follow this
conversation up with some program and I
think that will be awesome definitely I
would love to do that right well we'll
work it out thanks a lot yep thank you
chase it's been fun
yep see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
