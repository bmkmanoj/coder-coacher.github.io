it adding cost to our native scrub to
applications now in the future I'd like
to make my own that toast plug-in on the
channel and at Summit we definitely
going to do but for now let's use the
native script toast plug-in I'm going to
create a new project using TNS creates
native toast
using the templates native script -
templates - ng - tutorial this will
start a new native script project using
an angular template and it'll be
completely blank sounds good we can see
the Internet of toast and the next thing
we can do is add that toast plug-in sort
EMS plug-in adds native scrubs
- toast also we can start the emulator
by saying TNS or run iOS and then open
up inside of our editor so the first
thing I'm going to do is head over to
our components and we'll import all as
tossed from the native script torsed
plugin so now we can use it inside of
our components so we can say button and
within the button we'll have the text of
your toast and will have a tough events
equal to shore toast fairly simple we
now need to create that short toast
function so it's your toast and inside
of this function we are going to say
Const toast as equal to toast make text
and make text is essentially the cakes
that we want to show with the end of the
toast source a near the script is
awesome we could also have an optional
duration at this point but let's just
get the toast appearing on screen for
now we could also say toast dot and then
we have a variety of other options such
as get the duration set the duration set
the text for example up daily text in a
toast that was previously created and
then we have things like shore and
cancel we're going to be using shore
this point in time to show the toast on
screen let's change the title of our
action bar to be toast and if we save
our file and run it inside of our
emulator or on the
vice we should now see a button and the
button should be in the middle of the
screen and if we click it your toast we
get native script is awesome at the
bottom of the application so that about
wraps up the toasts plug-in within
native script if you would like to see
more near the script plugin development
for example making B toast itself then
of course let me know in the comment
section below otherwise if you'd like me
to cover specific native script plugins
then also let me know in that comment
section below until then hit that
subscribe button to stay updated and of
course I'll see you very soon in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
