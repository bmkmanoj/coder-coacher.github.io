navigate our user from these posts to
the post detail page with an anchor tag
so inside of our title here let's give
that an anchor tag with the reference
and we'll bind that to URL will put the
text of the anchor tag to be the h1 and
when we refresh the page you'll see now
will that all of our H ones become links
let's select one of these well upon
selecting it we have a white page now
this is to be expected but it's a quite
easy fix
all we need to do is inside of our post
don't HPS for post don't handlebars we
need to open up some presses again and
this time we want to use hashtag post we
can enter with a slash post and this is
saying anything inside of these tags is
going to be part of the post object so
we can have an article tag and that
simply tells us that this is a post or
an article we could use the h1 to bind
to the post a dot title again but
because we're inside of a post block we
can simply say a title and then if we
add a section so potentially we may
wanna parts of this h1 inside of a
header to stay that this would be the
post header and then we could have a
section that binds to the post content
once we save our file and we refresh you
can see that we have welcomed to course
that's the title of our post and then
the content of our post let's go back
and select a different item and quite
zoomed in at this point but you
shouldn't be able to see that we have
post images we have post text and post
items so already if you wanted to this
can't be a ghost thing
that this could literally be it if
that's all you want if you want a super
minimalistic theme that literally just
shows three posts and when we click the
item
it displays the item details then it you
know the very best all you need to then
add is the post time and that'll be it
but not many people is gonna want this
theme and people might say that
obviously your site is way too
minimalistic so what we're going to look
at on the next coming videos is adding
some style to this so we have the basics
down we've got all of the stuff that we
really need and of course we're gonna
add much more to this but at the very
core fundamentals we've created a ghost
theme already that allows us to display
information from our CMS because you
have to think about this already if we
made a new post over at slash ghost and
we made a new post this would appear on
screen we could then of course view that
post immediately it wouldn't look
perfect
but it would be there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
