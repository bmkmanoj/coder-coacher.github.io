the split pen with in ionic so this
wants us to have a menu as the screen
size gets bigger so for example on
desktops and tablets and overall it
increases the flexibility of our UI so
let's get started by making a new
project and I've made mine based on the
side menu template hence why I'm an apt
or HTML now inside of up to HTML I'm
going to take all this content and
indent it once the reason I'm in Denton
is because I'm adding an ion - split -
pin tag and as you might imagine this
acts as a wrapper over both our side
menu and our navigation we saved our
file and you'll notice that the screen
has now gone white and you're probably
wondering why that is well that's
because we haven't defined a main
content we need to tell Yannick what our
actual content is with the main
directive so when we admin to our ion
nav we save the file and everything goes
back to normal
so let's now make our application to be
much longer so it takes up the majority
of the screen and as you can see when we
select an item the main content here on
the right gets updated
now that automatically happens as you
can see when we move from 768 pixels and
above but what I want to do is change
that so it happens at a smaller distance
so on our ion split pen we can add the
when attributes and we can tell I on ik
when the minimum width is 500 pixels and
this will activate the split pen
functionality when the viewport is at
least 500 pixels so let's try it again
and as we move this a further afield you
can see that that now gives us the split
pin at a smaller distance than before
you can also take advantage of some
predefined media queries for example
extra-small and that's the winter of
zero pixels this effectively always
won't display the split pin no matter
what as you can see it doesn't really
work very well on a smaller device
screen we also have SM and that's for
small and it's 576 pixels and above we
have a medium for MD and that's 768
pixels and above and that's simply the
default and also larger ones for LG and
Excel and that takes up 992 pixels and
1200 pixels respectively we aren't
simply limited to passing through pixel
values what we can do is pass an input
into the when attribute and that I
rebuked can be a billion so if we go to
app component ES and we make a variable
named should sure pin and we'll equal
that to false and instead of saying
Excel we can say when should short pin
and now no matter how big we make our
window the side pane will never appear
so you can do this conditionally
depending on the functionality of your
up perhaps you want to let somebody set
this or you want to disable it in
certain occasions
so that's how we use the side pin within
ionic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
