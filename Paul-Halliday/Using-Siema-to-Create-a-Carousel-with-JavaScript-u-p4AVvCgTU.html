using the siema carousel and I hope I
said that correctly apparently it means
hey or hello in Polish so I probably
butchered that but nonetheless it's a
straight-up JavaScript carousel it's
quite lightweight which means you can
use this without worrying about bloating
up your bundle size at the same time and
this application will be using webpack
and Babel because I want to write es2015
chords and I also want to use bundling
so let's first install our dev
dependencies this will be webpack this
will also be babel core bubble loader
and bubble preset end we can use - -
save dev - save this to our depth
dependencies
and if you haven't done this already you
may want to run NPM and there - why to
create a basic package don't chase on
after that we want to install siema
and that's what we'll be using to Korean
our carousel then I want to create an
index tour HTML and an app don't GS
finally we'll create a web page dot
config yes and so allow us to configure
our web pack and then we'll need a way
to run this in the browser we can simply
use webpack dev server or we can use
HTTP server it's up to you for
simplicity you can either run npm
install' HTTP - server - g and we can
run up by saying poor dot to open up at
vs chords and at the same time HTTP
server dot so here we have an empty
project inside of all indexed or HTML we
can run HTML call on v to create a new
HTML project once we have the basis saw
a boilerplate HTML documents we can save
the file and then I'm going to move on
to our web pack config don't GS
configuring web pack is quite simple and
all we need to do is run module during
sports and export a new object that has
the context of the current directory
name
so basically we're telling web Punk hey
we want to look inside of this directory
our entry file is going to be AB dot GS
our output file will have the file name
of perhaps inside of a dist directory
slash bundle yes and then we'll also set
up some module rules I want to say I
want to test for any file that contains
daunted yes I want to exclude the node
modules folder and if you have any other
folders that you want to exclude you can
add them to this list and when a finds
one of these files I want to use the
following loader bubble loader with the
options of presets and the presets I
want to use is env so options should
actually be an object not an array
but after that change this is everything
we need inside of our web pack config so
now that we have all that finished we
can head over to our index dot HTML we
can create a script with the source of
slash test slash bundle yes that's our
bundle file any changes we make inside
of add-ons yes will subsequently be
minified changed to es5 and we'd have a
file inside of a desk directory called
bundle yes we're not quite at that point
yet though the first thing we want to do
is create a div with the class of
carousel inside of our dev I then want
to create other dibs the text of which
is going to be slide I'm gonna add a
dollar because that's going to be a
placeholder for a number and the number
of slides that I want is going to be
five
this here is Emma abbreviation I have a
video on my channel locking it Emmet so
check that out if you want to see how to
power up your HTML and CSS workflow
after that we can hit tab and then we
have slides 1 3 to 5 if we save our file
we have nothing too interesting
we also currently have an error inside
of our console saying that we can't find
the bundle don't GS file I'll be fixed
in a moment
because we're going to open up our
terminal and run web pack - - watch as
you can see this takes our app dot GS
and we then get a bundled OGS file when
we were fresh our page we no longer have
that era but at this point in time we
also don't have a carousel so how do we
fix that let's head over to app dot GS
and this is where all of the magic
happens and you'll see that it's very
very simple
so let's import see Emma from C Emma
will make a new carousel and that's done
by making any variable so const carousel
is equal to in new C Emma we can then
pass some configuration options here and
the first option is going to be a
selector and that's going to be the div
with the class of carousel we created
all your own so if we go back and look
at our markup you can see here that we
have this div with a class of carousel
once we tell our carousel that this is
the selector and we save the file you
can see that our HTML now changes our
document is different if we hover over
our slide 1 and we hold down the left
mouse button we can pan backwards and
forwards and by the lightning call this
allows us to navigate to a different
slide so we can go backwards and
forwards till we hit slide 5 but when I
hit slide 5 a think I'd like this to
loop back to slide 1 quite simple all we
do is add the loop equal to true and
when we refresh we can see that when we
get to 5 and we try and go ahead we get
pub back to slide 1 so this is quite
awesome we can then add a duration of
perhaps a thousand and look at the
difference that this makes so when we
slide front slide one to slide two
notice that it then takes a second for
the animation we can change our
animation if we add some easing let's
add some ease in watch now how we get a
different feel for our slide we can do
the same for ease out and we also get a
different feel for our slides as well as
this we can also change the amount of
items per page we can add the per page
option so if we set per page to and we
refresh our page you can see that we
have two items per slide we can also
have events that have fire when the
slide initializers all on the slide
changes let's look at an on innate event
let's simply use a console dot log on
annette's when our siema initializes
let's refresh the page and instantly you
can see in the console we have on a net
we can also fire another event when we
change slides so let's add an on change
we can give that a console dot log of
unchanged and if we refresh the page you
can see we initially get our on in it
but when we change the slide we get the
unchanged events so hopefully you can
think of different things in different
context which you could use these
different events but I feel like having
two buttons I don't want to keep going
backwards and forwards like this I want
a button that I can click to go
backwards or forwards underneath our
carousel let's make two buttons the
first with the idea forward and the
second with the ID of backwards inside
of our fgs we can scroll down and we can
get the element by ID that ID will be
forward so now we have a reference to
this element inside of this forward
variable let's do the same for backwards
and in each case let's add an event
listener so we can say forward don't add
event listener we could listen for the
click event and on the click event we
want to say carousel dot next this
allows us to go forward and if we copy
this and say it backwards
don't add event listener instead of next
we can save preb for previous let's save
our file and refresh our document but it
quickly add some text for our buttons
if we then click our forward button you
can see that we're going forward through
the slides our unchanged event is also
firing if we click backwards you can see
that we're going backwards and at the
same time our unchanged event is firing
once again but I don't want text for my
carousel I want an image so how might we
do that what's quite simple and involves
finding some images first so let's find
some images at unsplash I'm going to get
five random images and I'm going to add
the source of those images equal to the
images that I find so let's have five
different images and if we refresh our
page you can see everything is
completely broken and that's because it
doesn't really make sense to have two
images per page let's save that and
you'll see that we have just the one
image we can then hit forward to go
forward and you may want to normalize
the size of your images or we can hit
backward to go backwards but this time
we have a list of images instead of text
but I don't want the user to have to
click forward or backward don't even
drag through the carousel to have to go
next so how could we do that well it's
maybe potentially simpler than you
thought all we need to do is use set
interval and set interval allows us to
say carousel next and all we have to do
is specify a timeout so this is not
anything to do with CMR at all it's
simply just JavaScript
and we can set potentially the timeout
is four seconds the demonstration I'm
going to simply set to at this points
but you can choose a value of your own
when we refresh our page I'm not gonna
click anything and you should be able to
see that our carousel cycles through the
different images even though we're using
this different set interval method
rather than clicking a button you can
see that our own change event is still
firing so that's how we use siema to
create awesome JavaScript carousels it's
very lightweight I do suggest you use
this inside of your applications at
least I found it useful inside of my
projects what do you think of this
