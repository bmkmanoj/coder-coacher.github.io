you've ever noticed but inside of your
HTML you don't really seem to get
intellisense on your angular components
this is also true for members inside of
our class so if we said my name is equal
to Paul and then if we looked inside of
our HTML page and we try to bind to that
property my name we don't get any sort
of intellisense when we write a map this
M exists for the component so with an
ionic we have stuff like ion contents as
well as things like ion cards but you'll
notice when I'm writing ion card we also
don't get any intellisense now what if
those weights again
tella cents for every one of the things
that I've listed well fortunately there
is inside a visual studio chords we can
install the plug-in angular language
service so if you search the extensions
in the marketplace by saying angular
language service it comes up number one
here at the moment it's version zero one
three and if we install this in our
project and then if we attempt to write
the same code that we did before so
start off again by saying our
interpolation binding here and then
inside of that if we start typing my
name the property of our class we
instantly get intellisense
as well as that we can also see that the
my name property is on the register page
and if I command click this it takes me
to that exact position inside of the
register page we can see it's line 17 my
name is equal to poor it does get better
than that though for example if we want
to make a cards I've sent I on cards the
second that we type I on we have a list
of everything that starts with I on - so
we can say things like I on cards inside
if I on cards we might never have known
that there was an eye on card title or
even header we do know so we've got the
iron card header we could do the same
for I own card contents but it does even
get better than this because inside the
iron cod content if we had a button and
the button itself has a click event and
that click events is
register because this is of course we
register page we get instant feedback
inside of our HTML telling us that
there's an unknown method register
inside of the register page I don't know
whether you like me and often times you
write stuff like register at this point
in time and forget about actually
implementing the function if you are
like me then you're going to get this
intellisense and slide of the HTML so I
would wholeheartedly recommend this
plugin it's called the angular language
service and like I said you can get it
inside of es cords if you found this
useful and you want to see more videos
like this investigating vs cord plugins
then of course let me know in the
comments section below
and check out the learn ionic 3 from
scratch course so I do have a discount
cord from that still up and running
while the course is in early access my
name is Paul hit that subscribe button
to stay updated and I'll see you very
soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
