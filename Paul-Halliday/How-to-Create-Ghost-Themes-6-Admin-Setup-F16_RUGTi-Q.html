dashboard looks like so let's add slash
ghost to the end of our URL this takes
us to a welcome to ghost screen in here
we can create our account and this may
seem a little strange even though we're
on a local machine this is simply
creating a local account it doesn't
matter what you put in is the email
address so for example if we add hi it
Paul holiday dot IO and we moved on to
the next step we could then click I'll
do this letter at the bottom and you'll
now see that were in the ghost admin
dashboards we'll currently on the
stories page this allows us to look at
the different stories that we have
inside of our application you'll notice
that all of the text is in markdown but
we also have a variety of different
options here at the bottom left if we
click this one the toggle side-by-side
preview we can see what our markdown
looks like here on the screen there are
a variety of other options which I
suggest you look at here at the bottom
buts moving on we have other things like
the team these are different authors
which we can invite to our site we have
things like the general settings so for
example we could change the title and
description of our ghost blog the time
zone the different logos and much more
inside of the design section we can
upload our different themes as well as
add navigation items inside of tags so
we can add different tags you can think
of these as categories in a standard
blog site so at the moment we have a
getting started tag we have code
injection this is really good if you
want to add analytics to your blog as
well as different apps which allows us
to use things like slack with a web hike
we also have things like accelerated
mobile pages which makes much lighter
mobile pages for our users we have free
photos with unsplash and finally we have
labs now at this point I want you to
make sure that the public API is ticked
as we'll need this for our theme
development you can also take
subscribers as we'll be using the
subscriber theme
I like using the night shift this
changes the colors to be a dark
background so when we refresh the page
you'll see that everything is darker I
prefer this you may not it's up to you
but make sure you've got the public API
ticked and subscribers ticked any
subscribers that we do get will go
inside the subscribers section so when
people add their email address we'll be
able to export this to our email
software awesome let's like in making
our first theme and taking advantage of
the simplicity of ghost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
