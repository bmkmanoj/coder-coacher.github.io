page we could do this in a few ways we
could take the add a shopping item page
and we could conditionally maybe display
a different form but I'm just gonna keep
things simple and make an entirely
different page so once again let's head
over to our terminal and say I own a
generate page and this time it's going
to be called the Edit shopping item page
don't forget you may need to restart
I own a club if you find that your
application and no longer works
you
so what I want to do is then head over
to our home dot html' and make the eye
on item look a little bit more appealing
the way that we can do this is by adding
a detailed - posh attributes to this eye
on item what this then does is give us
this little button here that we can then
select and when we select this I want to
navigate the user to the edit or even
the detail page for now we will just
simply send them to the edit page but in
the future I do want to create a detail
page which allows us to get a particular
shopping item so let's do enough posh
and that will be to the Edit shopping
item page and now we'll have to pass
through enough params so now params are
simply Navitus that we can send across
to our new page and it allows us to
identify this item I'm surrounding it
here inside of these brackets and that's
because we'll be using the item from ng4
so the let's item here and we place this
inside of a JavaScript object this just
allows us to reference it a little
easier inside of the next page so I'm
simply going to say that this is an
object with the key of item and the
value is going to be that item that
we've selected so over at our Edit
shopping item ts inside of the ion
viewdidload we've simply go onto console
dot log this don't nav params
don't get and we want to get that item
so if we've done everything correctly so
far we should get the item inside of the
console when we select this item let's
open up our console and select the
iPhone 10 as you can see here we have
the key for this item we then also have
the name the price and the quantity we
may want to fix the price and quantity
types because at this points inside the
are actually strings we'll do that in a
future lecture so we now have access to
this item let's display it on screen and
perform an edit
so our edit shopping item page should
now have the title of item and we'll say
question mark because we don't quite
know what the item will be at run time
don't name this just allows us to
navigate to this page with all the
application breaking let's also add the
color of primary to our navbar so how do
we get access to this item
all we need to then do is inside of the
Edit shopping item page we need to
create an item of type item don't forget
to import the model for this and when
the view will Lord
we can set this don't item equal to this
don't know proms dawn gets and we want
to get that item so what is up next or
what I then want to do is take the ad
shopping item view and I want to take
all of the I on items inside of the
content it simply add it to this I on
content instead of ad I'm going to call
this save and we'll create a different
method called save item but the
functionality will be quite similar so
if we go back over to our edit shopping
item we can call this save item and if
we restart our application and select
iPhone 10 once again you can see that we
now have iPhone 10 quantity one and
price and nine nine nine this time we
have the Save button at the bottom and
the title of this item and at the top
here notice if we change this to
something like iPad pro it does reflect
this and the title because it's bound to
the same thing as our entry model so to
create this save item function I want to
head back over to our service and this
service will have a function called edit
item we can pass through an item like so
and we can perform an updates by saying
return this don't shopping list
reference don't update by using the item
key and then passing through the item so
what this does is it updates the item
that we've selected based on the key so
if we save this file and head back over
to our Edit shopping item we then it
need to add a private
shopping of type shopping list service
don't forget to import this and remember
this comes from our services folder like
so and then our edit shopping item then
becomes this dot shopping
don't edit item and pass through that
item so let's make save item take an
item of type item and when this has
completed we can simply said this don't
nav control don't set route and put the
route back to the home page so this one
has been slightly long so let's click on
iPhone 10 let's instead change this to
the iPhone 10 + hit save notice how if
we never get back to our shopping list
we have the iPhone 10 + if we refresh
this we still have this item and that's
because it's been committed to the
database so coming up next what I want
to do is create it toast a service this
will allow us to display messages each
time we save an item and it's an item
delete an item and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
