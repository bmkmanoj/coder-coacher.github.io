retrieve update and delete application
with ionic 3 and firebase so as you can
see we have a shopping list right now
and what we can do here at this point is
add something to our shopping list if we
added something for example cheesecake
and in number of cheesecakes that we
want to buy is obviously something
cat-like for you can see that this is
updated on our shopping list if we
select our cheesecake maybe you have
changed our mind and instead we want
only to perhaps were cutting back on the
calories we could then click Edit item
of course we could change the item name
as well if we wished but let's select
edit item this is updated here on our
application but more importantly this is
updated and of course added to our
firebase database so this is one of the
awesome things about firebase is that
any change we make here on the client
side we can push it across to firebase
quickly and easily as well as that we
can also select a particular item and of
course him a delete button perhaps we no
longer want the Cheesecake we can select
delete this will remove it from our
application and of course remove it from
the database as you can see it's
completely been removed from firebase
right now and this series takes it super
slow we comment line by line and you'll
see for the amount of power that we do
have we aren't writing a significant
amount of codes all of this code is easy
to understand and like I said it's all
commented anywhere we have an in-depth
discussion where we need to we don't
consider anything like authentication or
validation at this point but all we're
looking at in this series is that create
retrieve update delete we want to have
that solid we want to have a bucked up
in a database and of course Phi this is
a great suggestion for that so come
along with me in this series as we
create ourselves a shopping list
application with ionic 3 and firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
