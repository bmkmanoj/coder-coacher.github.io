updates to update your fuse tools head
back over to fuse tools calm then hit
get started at the top right this should
never get us to the download page and
we'll be able to see the change log for
the version 1.2 0 or update as you can
see there are a significant amount of
changes including a significant amount
of performance improvements stability
and improvements in the tooling as well
few Studios also got some updates with
increase in the speed and responsiveness
as well as new additions and fixes to
memory leaks aside from that you can see
the full length of changes here on
screen and of course over at fuse tools
calm don't forget if you do want a try
few studio you can of course get the 30
deer free fuse professional trial from
this same page but if you're ready to
update do click the operand system that
you're using so we're going to select
Mac OS and we can then go through the
fuse installer from here we can select
continue read the license and of course
accent head install on the installation
type enter your passwords
from here for me this can't get about a
minute but on your machine Amir very and
if everything was successful you should
see the installation was successful and
the software was installed on Windows
you'll have a similar message and then
we can have the close button
I'm electing to move the Installer to
the trash and of course we could head
over to our command line and create a
new fuse application that can be done by
saying fuse creates up and we'll simply
call this my app
they'll be running
is 1.2 and if you're using a current
project you need to CD into that project
and run unnal clean
this will lock to fix any update issues
that you may run into when changing from
fuse one point X to one point two
successful you should then see clean
completed inside of the terminal so this
likes of how we can install fuse 1.2 how
we can get up and running within new
fuse application and of course how we
can upgrades and clean our previous
version fuse projects I have some
exciting announcements for fuse on the
where hopefully later this week if we
can get everything wrapped up by then
until that time don't forget to hit that
subscribe button to stay updated and
I'll see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
