to theme it allows us to navigate
throughout the system it allows us to
select a different post and view
information about that post I want to
start making things a little different
and we'll start off by adding boma this
is a CSS framework that gives us access
to a lot of powerful features so how do
we do that well what I want to do is
create something known as a default
don't handlebars so let's make it
default don't HPS inside of our theme
folder this allows us to make is
standard HTML document you may have
noticed just then I typed HTML colon 5
inside a visual studio code this then
uses Emmet to expand this and gives us a
boilerplate HTML page if you're doing
this manually then I would suggest that
you at least have this viewport meta tag
as this makes things much easier to
scale on smaller devices for the title
we can bind to the current title of the
page
whereas in static documents we may have
something like Paul Holidays blog we can
change that to whatever the ghost meta
title is by binding to meta underscore
title as we also saw when we created our
ghost theme and we activated it we
needed something called ghost head so
let's also add ghost head inside of our
interpolation binding here to our header
but when we do this nothing seems to
happen we still have the same response
well that's because we need to add the
body of our content into this default
file so it would still be the same no
matter what but I want to serve the
content from default rather than index
so the way that we do that is by heading
back over to our index dot handlebars
file
and what we want to do is use the
interpolation binding we want to use an
exclamation mark and then in less than
sign and we want to call this default
what this does is it pipes the entire
file over to the default file so
everything in here then becomes
accessible inside of default because
you'll notice if we refresh our page at
this point in time because we've used
this default the handlebars everything
is now blank so the way that we actually
access this is by now using a three
squiggly braces saying body and when we
refresh the page we get everything back
and that's because the entire content of
our index the handlebars is now piped to
default and we can access this inside of
our page so why is this worth doing
while this allows us to add our ghost
head and subsequently in one second
the ghost Fatah so let's also add that
at the very bottom let's add ghost
underscore foot and this makes our theme
compatible now with ghost when we also
come to breaking out our files to
different components for example later
on we'll have a header component we'll
have a butter component just as we have
a body component so all of this will be
really important as time goes by and
we'll start seeing the benefits of this
very soon next up let's add bomber to
our project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
