have made this calculate a user
interface that you see on screen it
doesn't currently work with any sort of
functions it's simply just made with a
CSS grid and that's really important
because what we've made here is a
calculator with CSS grid with very
little cords and we'll be locking about
throughout this video so i'm also using
angular at this point in time but you
can use whatever you want you don't even
need to use it javascript framework it
just so happens that I was building a
calculator with angular and using CSS
grids so let's take a look at this
project so let's build a new project
with the angular CLI by seeing ng new
and I'm going to call this ng calc this
may take a couple of minutes to download
and install B dependencies once that has
completed we can a CD into ng calc
and of course open this up inside of our
editor and use ng serve to display this
inside of the browser when it comes to
actually laying out our application
there are many ways that we can do this
I'm going to simply make in a ray that
has all of the things that I want my
calculator to contain the interface of
the array will have an object that has n
neom that will have the item of the
calculator so this will be a button and
whether it is an operator or not I'm
going to go through and add all of the
items that I want to use inside of my
calculator so as you can see we now have
an array that contains everything such
as the clear operators things like seven
eight and nine for our numbers
multiplication subtraction and much more
I've also specified whether that thing
is an operator or whether it's simply
just in number like I said you don't
even have to use and RIF this you could
simply just pull all these items in the
DOM and I'll be navigating over to up
component the HTML and I'll remove
everything inside of that inside of here
I want a div with the class of
calculator then we'll have a div with
the class of grid wrapper and
essentially I want our calculator to
have a head so let's make another div
for the class of heads and this will
contain all of the commands that maybe
you have done after that underneath I
want the result and then underneath this
I want our calculator buttons so we can
do here an NG for and we can say let's
see of calc and we could pain DCM so
fairly standard we have a calculator
with the buttons like so the commands on
top and our result and the moment
everything is pretty standard we haven't
really done anything with CSS grid
Before we jump into CSS grid I'm going
to give this a class of operator and
then afterwards we'll come back and
switch this depending on whether it's in
number or operator so let's jump into
the CSS grid and that'll be at app dock
component on CSS and we'll start with a
whole grid wrapper we use display grid
and one of the easiest ways to determine
which items go where is by using what's
known as grid template areas and this
allows us to define areas of our grids
by name so I'm gonna put is an empty
string for now and I'm going to make the
head classes and I'm also going to give
this result here a class of result so
you should have the head result and
operate a class inside of our grid
wrapper so if we also parts of results
we can then specify that we want the
head to occupy the grid area of head and
the result to occupy the grid area over
result and finally all we now need to do
is say that we want the head to take up
four columns after that we want the
result to take up four columns and the
rest of our grid now fits in place
so we could specify again if we wanted
to now maybe now we wanted the operator
to have its own set of columns
it does not lie we would have to you in
this instance but we can if we want and
this is where it starts to get very
interesting because now we have this UI
that we can either make larger or
smaller and it will always keep that
same ratio no matter what so let's start
applying a little bit of styling to this
let's give our rapper or a background
color I'm also gonna give this some
padding and we'll give it a little box
shadow next we can define a background
color for our heads area we can then
change the color so you'll be something
like white if we wanted to we could dim
this down a small amount we can add the
text aligned to be right and maybe add
some padding so that allows us to keep
track of the previous commands here at
the top our result area can be quite
similar now so we can add text a line of
write again you can apply this a
background color and maybe some padding
of 10 pixels another color and change
the font size and we're starting to find
ourselves having it decent calculator
but at this point in time we haven't
styled the buttons and the buttons
aren't really in the correct location so
let's make ourselves a new class one for
number and one for operator we can give
the operator they takes the line of
Center and that does make all of our
buttons currently go in the center so
let's do the same for numbers and we'll
give our operator a background color of
something like in Nice red and when a
come style will give our numbers a
background color of a nice blue so how
do we make the numbers appear well the
way that we do that is by adding an ng
class so let's add an ng class instead
of a class and we will apply the
operator class when we have sc2 operator
otherwise we'll apply the number class
when we don't
notice on where we save our file we then
have this blue for our numbers and our
operators are all red and the best way
to add planning elements or rather a
gaffe to our grids is by simply going
back to our wrapper and adding a grid
- gap of 10 pixels if you find that
that's too much we could add 5 pixels
instead and there we have it we've built
ourselves a nice little calculator with
CSS grid no matter how large or small we
make this project
it always looks the same and of course
we could if we wanted to and it don't
calculator and we could add something
maybe like the max width of 200 pixels
and the margin of auto and this will
stick our calculator in the middle of
the screen the only issue with CSS grid
at this point in time is that it isn't
widely supported in older browsers so
make sure to be especially careful where
you actually use this but aside from
that it's been a fun little project
creating this calculator let me know you
