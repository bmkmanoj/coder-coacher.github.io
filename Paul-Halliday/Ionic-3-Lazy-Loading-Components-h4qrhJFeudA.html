components inside of ionic 3 so I have a
blank project here that I've opened with
ionic serve and now I'm going to open
this up for inside of my editor and
we'll start off by deleting the homepage
because we can either convert this to a
lazy loaded page or we can delete it and
recreate ER so let's delete the folder
named home inside of old pages folder we
can then generate the home page again by
saying ionic generates page form as you
see we've generated a page named home
and if we take a look back inside of our
pages we now have this home module PS
and it's important to make the
distinction inside of the home module
between this ionic page module and this
ionic module which will be importing in
our components whenever we want to
create a so-called page we will import
this ionic page module and we'll push it
down for child like so by saying ionic
page module for child home page this
will turn our home page into a ionic
page in which we can then add this ionic
page decorator to our page we'll take a
look at this distinction in a moment
when we come to create a component and a
few other different pages so let's start
off by making another page we can
generate a page but this time we can
call it about and inside of our home to
HTML we will have a button that will
link us to the about page so let's add
the iron button attributes you can also
add clear and block
when somebody clicks this we will
navigate to a bulb page and the text of
our button will simply say about
inside of all homepage we can write that
function navigates to a bulb page and we
can set this dot nav control push and
then as you can see it requires a page
strength or a page page so when we're
not using lazy loading we could set
about page and import the about page
from about slash about or alternatively
when we are using lazy loading we can
add this as a string and the reason that
this works is because we have this ionic
page module for child and we also have
this decorator here
the ionic page decorator
let's take a look at this in action so
if we click about we never get to the
above page as expected notice that we
haven't added the about page to our
declarations or entry components and at
the moment we are not lazy loading the
home page as we have it added to the
declarations and entry components so
let's convert that to a lazy loaded page
by removing it from declarations and
removing it from entry components let's
also remove the input here and then
inside of our app components we can also
remove the import once again and say
that our route page is a string and that
strength is home page so if we've done
everything correctly we should have the
same at responses before if we now to
get to that home page like so and then
if we select about we can navigate to
the above page but both pages are lazy
loaded so that's how we lazy load a page
but what if we want to lazy load air
component well there's a couple of ways
in which we can do that we can have
something called a shared component
module or alternatively we can have a
singular module per component so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to generate
some components let's pretend that our
application is a restaurant application
and perhaps our home page has a list of
different meals so we'll have a list of
different cards and the about page is
the above page of the restaurant so in
both scenarios we'll be making a card
based component and we'll firstly start
off by generating the menu list so let's
make a component with ionic generate
component menu list as you can see it's
generated a component name to the menu
list component with the selector of menu
list
let's try and add this to our home to
HTML so that's our home page we should
be able to serve menu lists but if we
save this and because we're using the
angular language service we get this red
underline it says that the menu list is
not in your element and if we try and
run this in the browser it won't work as
you can see we have this error that our
menu list is not known to angular so we
have to import the menu list but if we
go ahead and we add this to the app
module you can see that it's been added
to the main app module as a declaration
but because our homepage has not added
this to its module it can't see the menu
component so what we want to do is
remove this from the initial list of
declarations because when we're lazy
loading we only want to load the
component when necessary we don't want
the lured the component where it's not
necessary and inside of our home module
dot es we can import the menu list
module and I'm going to rename at the
menu list of module the PS from menu
list component module to menu list
module so let's import that component
like so if we now will take a look
inside of our application that we get
hello world from our menu list component
and that's because what we've done is
was stated to the home page module but
we want to use the menu list module and
the way that this works is that declares
the menu list component and also exports
the menu list component if we used to
remove the export this would not make
the menu list component available to
other modules so we'd have this issue
again where it would say menu list is
not a known element so in our modules we
have to both declare the component and
export the component let's now head over
to our about page and inside of the
above page we want to make in about
component so let's do that again by
ionic generator components about
if you remember in order to get this
inside of our bulb module I'm going to
rename this to a bulb module and what
I'm going to do is add the imports to
about module and perhaps we could take
better names if we're in production we
should now be able to access that about
component and in order to do that we'd
have to first remove this from our
declarations because it's automatically
added when we generate the component
but if we now select about we can see
our component inside a V bulb page so
that's one way of displaying the
components
you'd have to remember to import only
the modules that you need for example if
we wanted to display the menu list
inside of our about page we'd have to
also import the menu list module before
we could do that this will then give us
access to the menu list inside of the
above page would look something like
that and then inside of our bulk page
we'd say - hello world's one for the
menu list and want to the about let's
rename this for now so our about would
simply say about and our menu list would
say menu list so now you can see on the
home page we have menu list and if we
click about we have about and menu list
now this way of adding these modules to
our pages is a good way to lazy lord our
components as we only get the components
that we want let's say we decided that
we no longer want this menu list module
inside of our about page module we could
simply remover and it would disappear
from our component we wouldn't be
importing the JavaScript to do with that
module because we don't need to we don't
want any more inside of the bulk
component so we'd remove it from our
iron content and only have about and it
would work as intended there's another
way of lazy loading our components and
this is by using a shared module and in
order to do that we'd have to first
remove our menu list module and also be
about module for our components like I
said in production we'd rename this
and instead what we have is a components
module TS and we would build in module
like so we would start off by importing
our about components from about dock
components like so we would declare our
about components and we'd also export
the components or decks forth above
component would also do the same for our
menu list component it declare it as
well
instead of calling this via bulb module
which looks like it's being called would
call s the component module so then if
we wanted to use our components for
example inside of all home to HTML if we
wanted to use menu lists we no longer
could because we deleted that module
instead we'd import the components
module and by doing that we have access
to the menu list once again and we'd
have to fix the about module dot es to
remove the link to the above module
and we'd also have to add the components
module to the about page module and the
final thing to do is import the ioniq
module from ionic angular we can add
this to the list of import
and if we take a look at our application
you might have to restart I otic serve
but now we have the menu list and the
above and menu list but we're using a
shared module you will notice though
that we only have one bundle coming
across here and this contains the above
component the menu list components and
our two pages but if we were to put this
back to being singular modules and only
importing the components that we need it
would be different bundles so depending
on the size of your application and some
other factors you should consider the
style of lazy loading that you want to
use if you have a substantial amount of
components then it to be honest the best
way would be a singular module if you
only have a few and you want to keep
things simple by only importing the
components module then use a shared
module but if the size of the bundle
coming down the network is of absolute
importance then of course these
individual modules so this has been an
example of lazy loading your components
with feature modules and shared modules
inside of your ayane applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
