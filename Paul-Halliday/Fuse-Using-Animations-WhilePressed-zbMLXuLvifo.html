animations within fuse this is a very
simple example but it should get you up
and running to thinking in the sort of
fuse way of animating things it's quite
easy and let's jump into what I want to
do is I have a rectangle that when we
click spins around and changes color not
too crazy but a good enough starting
point so let's have a start tunnel and
we'll put that spike panel in the middle
of the screen source alignment is equal
to Center and inside of that spike panel
will have a rectangle and the name of
that rectangle source aux name is equal
to ranked and by seeing this UX name is
equal to rect that means we can capture
this object in other areas within our UX
so we can say rect door fill in other
areas and that will update the fill with
that rectangle so this will make sense
in a second when we add a fill and that
fill is going to be a blue so unmoral
can't see the rectangle and that's
because we need to add a width and
height so width is going to be 100 and
height is also going to be 100 there is
our rectangle with infuse we have
different events so when we click
something when we press something and so
on we're going to say while pressed so
this is going to happen while we press
the rectangle we're going to not get
into rotate and rotate we'll rotate the
rectangle around we have to give that a
target and we can say our target is
equal to rect we want to rotate it by 90
degrees and we can add a duration such
as 1 so one second and right now that's
all we need to type if we click our
rectangle we see it starts to rotate
when we let go it goes back to its
initial position we get to add that to
180 and we see that rotates 180 degrees
if we let go of the mouse it goes back
to normal
we can also hug into the change event
sort of change right here we can say
rect dot fill and this will change the
color of the rectangle so essentially
all we're doing is saying rekt' dot and
that gives us access to these properties
from within the rectangle so if I add it
purple here and we click on the
rectangle once again it cause purple as
it's going 180 degrees quite cool we can
also add a duration to this is 0.5 and
we see it doesn't happen instantly but
it happens over a 0.5 duration and we
could also take this even further we
could make another change event and that
change will melt I'll get the rect dot
width and this is where it starts to get
a bit crazy so we can put the width
equal to 300 and the duration of which
maybe one second this should be quite
funny are you ready and as you can see
our rectangle starts to change shape as
it sort of spins around and changes
color so now we have this absurd
animation which actually looks quite
cool in a few lines of code this is one
of the powers of fuse and I hope I've
inspired you to start adding some
animations inside of your fuse
applications we're going to look at
animations in more detail because it's
so easy to create animations within fuse
but for now this should serve as a
gentle introduction to both while
pressed rotates change and of course
looking at rectangles if you'd like to

let me know in the comment section below
where you think and what you'd like to
see and until next time my name is Paul
and I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
