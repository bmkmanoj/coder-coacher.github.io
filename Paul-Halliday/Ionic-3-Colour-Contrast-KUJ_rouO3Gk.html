primary color and a blue secondary color
in the same way that we do right now we
can see with the accessibility tab over
a material dial slash color but black
text would not be legible if it was a
normal size but it would be legible at a
large text size whereas the white text
would be legible in both large and
normal text sizes as we look at our blue
we can see that the white text is not
legible at either large or normal text
size but the black text is this means
we're dealing with different contrast
ratios and we might want to implement
our own contrast ratio rules how do we
do that inside of ionic well I'm going
to make a new sample project called
contrast and from within this we're
going to lock it implementing this pink
and blue with the black contrast text so
I've run ionic starts contrast Blanca
metals by a new project now contrast and
when the dependencies have installed
we'll lock it implementing this inside
of a project so within that this project
I'm going to run ionic serve to star
this in the browser and open this up
inside a visual studio chord so the
first thing I'm going to do is head over
to our home page at home door HTML and
it will change the title to contrast
demonstration and inside of all content
I'm going to add an eye on fab a button
with the eye on fab attribute the color
of secondary and inside of the button
that will have an eye on - icon and the
icon name of ads
we'll put this five are the bottom right
and if we take a quick look at what our
project looks like I'm using ionic
gloves for this then we can see our
application and mirrors what we saw on
the material dial site let's now change
these colors to reflect this our primary
color is this pink and inside of our
theme variables we can change the color
of our primary color and our secondary
color can be this blue in order to give
the navbar bar color of the pink we
could set color
primary and we get our navbar color of
pink and our sub button color of blue
but you'll notice that our blue does not
have that black contrast as stated on
material that I also let's fix that and
we can fix this by adding some
parentheses around our secondary and
setting the base color to the blue and
adding is secondary contrast now we
don't have to search for any other
colors we can just simply set the
contrast to apply and if we take a look
at this inside of the browser we can see
the contrast color for our blue fire
button has now turned black ionic does
perform some contrast check in itself
and we'll look to change this but if we
want to be 100% correct with the
material guidelines we kind of course
change that color the same of course
applies if we select their 500 color for
our pink we do find that now we have
this problem why we can't use the white
text the white text is not legible at a
normal size but it is legible inside of
a large text size but if we take a look
at the user interface as mock-up we can
see that Google themselves still use a
black color for this text if we change
our primary colors to instead be that
pink pink five hundreds we can add a
base color once again for this and their
contrast and at the moment I'm going to
set this to black once again if we take
a lot we can now see that pink with that
black text it's a good idea to follow
these accessibility guidelines and of
course if you do want to add your own
contrast this is how you do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
