text-to-speech application the star with
that run ionic starts TTS blank v2 this
will make a new ionic to project based
on the blank template named TTS after
that we can add the Cordova plugin by
running Cordova plugin adds Cordova
plug-in TTS suite let's open up in the
escort to start with I'm gonna change my
TS config to be targeting es6 next I'm
gonna install the ionic native package
for text-to-speech to do this head over
to the command line and type in npm
install ionic native text-to-speech save
with ionic native 3.0 and above each
plug-in is its own package as part of
the ionic native project we can then
head over to our source and open up our
home dot HTML I'm gonna make a new title
and then text to speech and I'm gonna
put the color to be primary I'm gonna
run this in the browser using ionic
serve while that's loading I'm going to
start creating an item there we go the
item is going to be simply a label and a
text area like so
and we're gonna have a button underneath
that when we click the button down here
anything in this text area will be
spoken by the voice of your operand
system let's hook up the click event
inside of our homework on ponent we can
make it text variable type of string we
can import the text to speech from ionic
native text to speech in order to use
this in our app we will also have to go
to app module and import there when
event Porter will can add it to the
providers list and then back in our home
components we can instantiate it in the
constructor and then we can fill out the
say text function I'm gonna make this
async and it's gonna return a promise
and add a try-catch block to catch any
errors and we're gonna run it awaits
this star TTS don't speak based on text
so basically it's gonna say anything and
this star takes variable here which
wouldn't capture an old model so after
that we can log out successfully spork
and then this dot text and if there's an
error we can log out the error we can
see how this would look in the browser
obviously it's not gonna work in the
browser you'll have to check on the
device but we just say hello world and
then on the device when we click this it
would of course actually say that in the
console we can see that Cordova is not
available so it would work on the device
but it won't work on the browser I hope
this has helped if it has I'd love you
to hit that subscribe button and of
course check out learn ionic to calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
