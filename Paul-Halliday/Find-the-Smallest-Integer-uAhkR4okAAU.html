number inside Evan a rare so given any
array of images we need to make a
solution that finds the smallest in the
jump so in this example we have 34 1588
and 2 we need to return to the same
cause of our second array we'd need to
return - 3 4 5
the final assumption is that for the
purpose of this example the supplied
array will not be empty so we don't have
to check for that I'm going to use
quokka so inside of the editor I'm going
to paste in the function and we will
simply make a new constant called
numbers and that will be 34 15 idiots
and - this much is the first example and
we'll start off then by finding the
smallest integer based on the numbers so
it's up to us now to write this function
so what we can do based on the fact that
these arguments are an array of numbers
is we can actually return math dot min
and this represents the smallest number
based on the spreaded arguments and if
you've recently looked at my spread
operator video you'll see that what we
do here is actually quite similar if not
the same for this problem so we can say
constable estava
is equal to finding the smallest integer
based on those numbers and if we log
that out we can see that we do get to
let's change any one of these numbers -
V - 3 4 5 and of course we can expect to
find - 3 4 5 and that's effectively
because what we're doing is we're
passing each item into this math at da
minimum which returns us the smallest
number based on at that array so I'm
gonna take this function I'm going to
copy it and we'll paste it in as a
solution let's run these sample tests to
ensure everything passes as expected
after submitting we can see some other
examples and it turns out everybody
seems to be using a similar approach
although this one does use a Rev reduce
take
and the previous and the current
arguments and returns the minimum based
on that so it does he's quite a similar
approach but to be honest I do think the
arguments and the spread of Reds are
tends to be better same goes for this
assorted example so we have this
comparison function and then of course
we're just returning that smallest
number once again we have another reduce
example this one uses if for loop so
essentially we have each one of the
arguments inside of the for loop and
then a simple comparison function and of
course we're then returning bad number
so based on these solutions I do think
the spread operator is the best but let
me know what you think inside of the
comment section and how you think I did
in at this test
