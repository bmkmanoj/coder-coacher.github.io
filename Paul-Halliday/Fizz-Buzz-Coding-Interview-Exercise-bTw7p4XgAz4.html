the fizzbuzz problem and this is a
common chord and interview question it
usually looks like this
so we out part integers from one to a
hundred and for each multiple of 3 we
print fizz for each multiple of 5 we
print buzz and for multiples of 4 3 &amp;amp; 5
we print fizz buzz let's start off by
firstly outputting numbers from one to a
hundred so we have a for loop we can
simply do for I is 1 and for I is less
than 101 keep incrementing I then simply
console dot log I we can then see in our
console right here
we've got the numbers 1 to 100 next we
want to check to see whether these
numbers are divisible by 3 so we can say
if I is divisible by 3 then console dot
log fizz you can see we get 1 2 3 fizz 4
5 6 fizz but we don't actually want to
be displaying 3 we want to be simply
displaying fizz instead but we'll get to
that in a second next we'll check to see
whether their numbers are a multiple of
5 and if they are we'll simply log buzz
and we can see and I'll both are three
and five multiples we get fizz and buzz
so let's make it now so we don't
actually show 3 and 5 let's move our
console.log statements into if it
doesn't match either fizz it buzz simply
log out as you can see we get one to
phase four buzz fizz which is multiples
of three and five now for multiples are
both 3 &amp;amp; 5 we need to print fizz buzz
now you might think that we could go
else if is divisible by 3 and is
divisible by 5
print fizz buzz but you'll notice that
that doesn't work and that's simply
because it's hitting either one of these
two conditionals first and it never
actually hitting this so we need to move
this up to the top like so and then add
our else statement here and remove the
else from the top statement we can then
see if it's divisible by both 3 &amp;amp; 5 we
get fizzbuzz so we can improve this by
making it a little bit easier to
we could simply save our multiple of
three and multiple of five and then
switching out our statements for our new
variables and you'll see as expected we
get the same result multiples of three
Affairs multiples of five are buzz and
for both we get fears of buzz so there
we go the fizzbuzz problem if this
helped then hit the subscribe button for
more programming tutorials and until
then I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
