at transitions inside of our native
script angular applications what am I
talking about well if we hit this
navigate to profile button you'll see
that we have almost this curl up so it's
like this page is turning between each
application screen unfortunately this is
not supported on Android so when we hit
navigate to profile we simply just have
a normal transition but this is the
power of native script were able to
develop two applications with the same
code base and one isn't a compatible
option the application doesn't break so
we've just locked a curl and we can also
see curl up and that's just what we saw
there so curl does equal curl up and
finally we also have a curl down and all
of these things are iOS specific so
let's add name equal to curl down and
you will notice that how I'm actually
doing this is I'm changing between two
routes and we have this sort of comma
and opening up this new object
specifying the transition with a name of
gyration and curve so quite simple you
just need to make sure that you have
your routes set up before this and if
you want to know how to do that check
out my angular course that can be found
or appalled Halliday dot IO but before
we get into that let's hit save and when
our application boots up again on both
devices
once again we'll only see this on iOS
but when we hit navigate to profile
you'll see that we have this curled down
animation ok so next up we have what's
known as explored and this is Android
lollipop
so that's SDK 21 and above so this isn't
compatible on iOS so let's type in
explored and hit save
so once we hit save and click navigate
to profile you'll see be explored
animation it's a quite strange
definitely is a strange one
but there may be some circumstances
where you want to use this person I
can't think of many but there we go next
up we have a Fed so if we change the
transition name to be fed we have this
sort of fit between both screens now
this is the same for Android and iOS we
also then have flip and this is the same
as a flip right so you'll notice if we
click the button it sort of flips
between a both screens and it does give
us this 3d effect we have a similar one
for flip left or so you can imagine if
we hit flip left they were just further
from the other direction next up we have
a slide and that's the same as slide
left so this does slide between both
screens and you can see that it also
applies a little fade now when you are
application you'd most likely make this
much quicker this is half a second or at
least a second yeah we have this at one
second I probably make it anywhere
between two hundred milliseconds
absolute max to about 250 and you will
see that the slide left would look much
better up next we have a slide right
which is the same thing but flipped
backwards and then we also have slide
top and slide bottom let's take a look
at that so if we hit a slide top you can
see it almost slides aware to the top
and you can
much more pronounced on Iowa's but once
again we do have quite a long duration
let's do the same for a slight bottom
and when we hit navigates profile it's
all slides where to the bottom like so
so this has given us quite a few
built-in transitions that allow us to
navigate between different pages and
provide an animation now it doesn't stop
here we can also change the animation
curve itself so the curve at this point
is linear we could change that to be
ease in and what ease in does is it
causes the animation to begin slowly but
then speeds up as the animation
progresses so once we save this we can
check out the application and when we
hit navigates profile notice how it
starts slowly and gets quicker we also
have ease out and what ease out does as
it starts the animation quickly and
slows down as it progresses if you
wanted to have both combined into one
you could use ease in out and we have
this sort of animation that we can look
at now and that means when we click this
navigate to profile it sort of starts
slowly accelerates and then slows down
again so something is an interesting one
for perhaps most interesting of all is
the spring and this produces a bounce
effect on the device when we navigate
between the two pages if we hit iOS
you'll notice that nothing actually
changes in this regards but navigates
profile on Android does provide that
bounce effect
in my opinion I don't really think I'll
be using this much in my native script
ups but you may find a use case where
you want the user interface to bounce so
by adding this transition object to our
rasa extensions when navigating between
pages we can add a transition to our
native script applications I hope you
