script projects to 3.0 now if you've not
made in native scrub application before
this is super simple so all we need to
do
it's the NPM install native script - G
this will install the near descript CLI
for three point X and of course any
projects that we make with that CLI will
automatically be three point X after
installing the native script feel I
let's take a look at the dependencies of
a newly created project with the updated
CLI so from within our native script
repos directory I'm going to run TNS
creates hello world and that is
essentially saying TELRIC native script
the CLI creates a new project named
HelloWorld and use the following
template the template is going to be the
native script template ng tutorial this
is an angular project up and running
with native script so our project has
now been created let's take a look at
inside the visual studio chords if we
take a look inside of our packaged or
JSON we can see the type of things that
have changed within at the 3.0 release
we have our native script angular now
being 3.0 angela is 4 point x and above
and the TNS core modules are 3 point x
and above
we compare that to for example an older
native scrubbed application on to point
X we have an older package here on the
right and this was built with the native
script 2.5 or CLI let's upgrade this to
instead use the native script 3.0
dependencies we first need to install
the TNS core modules version 3.0 you can
see this has now been upgraded inside of
our project we then need to install the
native script on your package at 3.0 we
do get a lot of warnings telling us that
we need to install a higher version of
angular so let's fix that you are
updating all of the angular packages to
be their latest version if we install
that we can see the differences our
angular now becomes four one two and
it's telling us we now need to install a
higher version of rxjs
and zorn a jazz so let's fix this by
installing is on GS at latest and rxjs
at latest and finally let's upgrade our
native script dev type script dependency
and now you can see our typescript is
being upgraded to 2.3 2 and our native
script dev typescript 2 0 4 4 now there
are some differences between the project
that we just upgraded and the template
that we created in new angular native
script project with and this just
reflects the fact that the template is
not currently up to date with all of the
latest dependencies but this is just an
overall reflection about how you need to
keep your projects up to date with the
latest changes if you feel the diesel
then upgrading in the future obviously
makes it harder because more and more
things change as time goes by so in this
video we like to taking an older native
script angular project and upgrading it
to 3.0
as time goes by things will continue to
develop and if you'd like to see more
need a script videos then of course hit
that subscribe button and let me know
any comments section below I have a
guide coming out very soon showing how
we can make native script plugins so
look forward to that one and until next
time my name is Paul and I'll see you
very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
