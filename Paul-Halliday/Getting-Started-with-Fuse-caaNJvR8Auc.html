something a little different and that's
fuse tools this is a way to build native
applications on iOS and Android using
JavaScript fuse is a little different in
the Centers of may use JavaScript but it
doesn't use HTML we have this UX
language that we can use to sort of
display our user interface we're going
to take a look at this in more detail
and we will make our first fuse
application this will be a simple button
that when we click shows a greeting head
over to fuse tools calm and download
fuse click the get fuse Now button fill
in your email address and download and
install the project when you've done
that you can either use the graphical
user interface or the command line to
make in new fuse project I'm going to
say fuse create up and then the name of
the app is going to be greeting we now
get the created project greeting at that
directory and we can see D integrating
and safe use preview this will start the
iOS emulator so as quick as that the
application has been loaded built in
seven seconds and we have an empty up
let's open this up fit inside of BS code
because we're dealing with dot ux files
we won't actually have any sort of code
highlighting so we will need to download
an extension for this and i've
downloaded both the fuse build blogger
plugin and the fuse language plugin for
vs chords when you've done that we'll
have called highlighting and we'll be
able to get on making our project we can
think of our views as pages and if
people want to see more fuse videos we
can take this in more detail and look at
how we create our own pages but for now
we'll simply put all the logic inside
this main view UX and we can start off
by making a stack panel if you've used
something like native script before
you'll know a stat panel is because
you'll have used in the past essentially
everything is stacked on top of one
another inside of our smart panel we can
have a button and we can see the text of
the button is equal to shore greeting
and if we save this and take a lock it
inside of our emulator we have Shore
greeting and this is at the top aligned
in at the center let's align our start
panel
using alignment equal to center and this
will change our button to be in the
center of the page and we can hug get
into the button to collect attribute and
we can say clicked and when we do click
the button we want to toggle a
particular function we can decide what
we want to toggle by saying target and
supplying the toggle with a target Nords
and at the moment I'm going to say Shore
greeting
so we're toggling B shore greeting nodes
we need to create that and we can do
that by saying while true so only show
this while true and we can hook into the
UX name of that Shore greeting and
that's what we're toggling so we're
toggling this your greeting and we're
saying while this is your greeting is
true we want to display a text view and
the textview will simply say hello fuse
let's take a look by clicking the button
that's your greeting and we see hello
fuse and once it aligned detects you in
the center by saying alignment Center
and now one we click it will be aligned
in the center similar to that button
we've created our first mobile
application then with fuse and we could
deploy this to iOS or Android I think
it's always good to look at different
ways in which we can make mobile
applications we have things like ionic
react native native script xamarin and
the likes but fuse is one of those
projects that's sneaking up in that
scene if you interested we can look at
more fuse videos incorporate things like
typescript and much more let me know in
the comment section below if you'd like
to see that and until next time my name
is Paul and this has been a hello world
with fuse tools</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
