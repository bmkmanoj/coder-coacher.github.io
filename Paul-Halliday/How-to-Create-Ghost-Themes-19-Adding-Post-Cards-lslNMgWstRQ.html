posts luck at this point in time we have
a simple list of posts but I want to add
a card so for each post it will have a
card which will have a Pecha the title
of the post and a description so let's
think about how we could achieve that
well we can create a new partial and the
partial will allow us to then use this
feature over and over for as many posts
that there are inside of all Ghost
database so let's make a partial and
that partial we call post underscore
card dot HBS so it will add an article
tag as that will suggest that this is an
article and then to use the Balmer cards
we can have a div with the class of card
image will also have a div with the
class of cards content and will start
off with the card image so here were
introduced to the earth tag so what we
want to do at this point is check to see
whether we have the card image to start
with we could either put it inside of
the div and then maybe we want to show a
placeholder image if there is no image
with the article or alternatively we
could put it outside of the div and not
sure the card image class at all this is
entirely up to you and I suggest that
you play around with both ways and you
come up with your own design so we're
gonna use the double curly braces again
and this time we aren't going to use a
hash tag this is going to allow us to
say hash tag if and this is going to be
a conditional statement
so we're only going to show this piece
of HTML if the following is true so if
we have a feature image then we show
this HTML and we show that we no longer
want to use this F tag by using slash F
inside of these presses so then we can
use a figure and we can give this the
class of image and also is - and if you
want to use 16 by 9 or a different ratio
for example 4 by 3 we could do and we
can stick the image inside of here with
the source equal to feature underscore
image we can give this the alt tag of
something like title and this would be
the post title so to check that this
works I'm gonna save the file and then
over at our indexed or HBS instead of
having this h1 inside of the for each
I'm going to comment that out and
instead I want to do a 4h over the post
card so that can be done with the
greater than sign and we want to use the
post card template so when we refresh
the page you shall be able to see these
3 images and that reflects the fact that
we have three cards all of which have
images so we're of course showing these
images here on screen this is good news
for us because at the moment we've done
everything correctly and we are showing
the cards so back over to our post cards
and now we can fill out the card content
at this point we may want to have
another F this time we want to check to
see whether the author dot profile
underscore image exists and this is once
again up to you it depends whether you
want to show the author's image if you
do we can have a div with the class of
media we can then have another div with
the class of media left
and what this allows us to do is a
properly set our image to the left of
the cards inside of the card we can then
have a figure with the class of image
and this time we are going to use is -
48 times 48 this is going to set us a 48
pixel by 48 pixel image in which then we
can display our author dots profile
underscore image and what old tyke could
be profile image and if we refresh our
page you'll notice that at this moment
in time we don't have an author image
let's go ahead and upload one by
navigating to our local host / ghost and
I'm gonna make this a little larger and
now under team we can add an image for
our user if I hit add a picture and I
select a picture from my device I should
then be able to hit save we can go ahead
and do it for the ghost user as well so
you can do for your user and ghost and
that will allow with the initial default
posts to have your image or perhaps a
different image and your use are the one
that you created with this instance of
ghost to also have potentially the same
image or a different image so make sure
you upload an image for both users and
when we do that you can see that we then
have this image associated with that
post so what's the next thing to do well
the next thing that we need to do is add
some content to our cards so this is
underneath our if block and we want to
have a div with the class of content
and inside of here we want to display
some form of description about the post
so that will be good for a paragraph tag
and we can then determine whether a
description exists and what this means
is that when we actually publish a post
with ghost we can add our own meta
description if we elect not to do that
it will use the first set of characters
up until the amount that we specify so
we can add our own custom description or
it will simply use the characters from
the post so maybe something like the
first paragraph so let's determine with
if whether the meta description is
available if it is then we want to
display the meta description
and here were introduced to this else
keyword for the first time and this
allows us to display a conditional other
piece of information so if it doesn't
exist so if we haven't part our own Meta
Description instead we want to show the
excerpt but we want to cap the words at
a 40 and you can cap a different amount
if you want it's entirely our team and
whatever you are left to do for your
theme and at the end of our excerpt I
like to add some ellipses to simply show
that there's more to this post we can
then end our conditional if block and
we'll we save and refresh
we now have a card that has some
information about the post but we are
missing a title so let's then put the
title above this content block well part
of perhaps as a h1 with title as the
text if we quickly save and luck we can
see our title is then added to the cards
but we need to give this a class of
title and I'll also give this is - 4
this will allow us to size our title
appropriately and perhaps next we may
want to show the author and when we
published this post so this one would be
another paragraph and we could do that
underneath the excerpt and we can state
that we want to display the author and
if we give this a quick refresh you can
see that we have ghost and that's
because the current author of these
posts are ghost we could then display
the tags so this would be ghost getting
started so people would be able to
select this tag after displaying the
tags we then want to assure the time and
we can pass through at this point the
current date so we can bind to the date
here inside of this time block
so now we have the author's name we have
the current tag and the current dates
which that was posted what I'm going to
do now is said that the author posted
this in the tags section so in getting
started and we could then add on to that
so effectively we are saying Paul
Holliday posted in getting started on
October the 2nd 2017 and you can change
that however you like it's entirely up
to you but now if we'll make this a
little larger you can see that it's not
quite practical at this point because
the pictures are taking up the entire
screen but normal s you can see that we
now have these three cards
and this is showing us information about
our post if we select all the posts you
will notice that we then get this next
page which gives us a new set of posts
this is of course zoomed in quite a bit
but you can see when we zoom out we get
a similar effect so I'm relatively happy
with our cards I think it works well
with our application we may need to add
some padding and I think only to add
some columns to display more than one
section of cards let's take a look at
that in the coming lectures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
