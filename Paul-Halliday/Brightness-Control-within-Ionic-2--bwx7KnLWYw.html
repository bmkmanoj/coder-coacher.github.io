today we're gonna be looking at
brightness and controlling that on our
device
sought to get started and sure you made
in you up with ionic starts brightness
blank - - V - I'll make a new ionic -
out based on the blank template and then
we can add the Cordova and ionic native
modules so let's run ionic plugin adds
Cordova plug-in brightness
we then need to install the ionic native
plugin for brightness or NPM install - -
save its ionic - native slash of
brightness I'll save the ionic net of
brightness module to our project we can
then open up in vs court and as usual
the first thing we have to do when using
an ionic native plug-in is to import it
inside of our app module so imports from
at ionic need of brightness we need to
import the brightness provider so import
brightness and add it inside of our
providers like that we're done in this
file now so we can head over to our home
page I'm going to build up the template
so I'm going to change the title from
ionic blank to home page also gonna add
a color to the navbar I'm feeling blue
so inside of our ion content
we're gonna have a cards so I on cards
inside of the cards will have a header
and the header will save brightness and
inside the ion card content we will have
an ion range so on ion range it's going
to have the color of secondary and the
min range will be zero for zero
brightness and the max range will be 10
now you could put this at a hundred or a
thousand it just depends on how accurate
you want to be with your brightness I'm
gonna round mine anywhere so I'm just
gonna put it at ten and for each step
we'll make it once on the scale so each
step on the range will be 0 1 2 3 4 etc
the range is gonna have two labels the
first axis will be range left of zero
and the second one will be range right
and that will be one will also need a
change event on the range so when
somebody moves the range up or down
we'll need to call a particular function
that function will be set brightness so
I on change and we'll hammer that to set
brightness like that the set brightness
function will also need a brightness
that will edit in here
so we'll also need an NG model and for
our ng model will simply have brightness
now we can go inside of our component
and why this altogether so for now I'm
gonna make our set brightness function
and it's gonna leave it empty and I'm
also gonna make our brightness at the
top here so brightness and that's going
to be in number if you've worked with
ionic native plugins before you'll know
that we have to import from ionic native
brightness the brightness provider and
then we have to inject it inside of our
constructor so I'm gonna save private
bright brightness so the brightness
scale for the Cordova plugins simply
looks like this zero is the lowest
brightness that you can get one is the
highest brightness that you can get and
minus one point naught is the system
default brightness
now you can't step up in that floating
point values so we couldn't have this as
a minimum of zero and a max of one and
we step up in 0.1 so instead we have to
take this value and divide up by ten
so back in our set brightness then we
can have a new brightness and that's
going to be equal to whenever the
brightness is divided by 10 simple
enough and then we can use this dot
bright dot set write this as simply the
new brightness now set brightness does
resolve a promise so we could if we
wanted to simply log out you know
brightness set
but for now I'm just gonna simply leave
it as a brightness I don't really think
we need to do anything with that so we
can just set the brightness to the new
brightness so if we run this on the
device so firstly run on Android we'll
need to run ionic platform add Android
now I'll add the Android platform to the
project and then I'm gonna run a live
reload server on the device so ionic run
Android - OH and then we'll be able to
test our brightness on the device so
here we have our card with a range of 0
to 1 and if we move it along the screen
you can't see this right now but the the
brightness is definitely moving from 1
to 0 and from 0 back to 1 so we've
implemented the set brightness now I
suppose we need to implement the gets
brightness so let's get the brightness
on the device and this is gonna resolve
a promise so you know me I like to use a
sink and a weights so in our TS config
change your target to es6
we can then make the async function get
brightness and we can resolve the
promise of this top right I'll get
brightness so for example we can make a
variable here let's current brightness
is equal to this top right don't get
brightness and then once we resolve that
promise with the weights we can simply
log out current brightness if we make a
button below the cards and simply says
get brightness with the click event of
get brightness if we press a get
brightness it becomes one point not and
that's because my phone is currently as
bright as it can be
if we move it in the middle
we get no point six
if we move it a bit further we should
get about eight or nine and then if we
move it really down we get 0.2 so while
you can't see on the screen the
brightness is being manipulated as we're
moving the range up and down another
thing that we can do with this plug-in
is to keep the screen alive so let's
make a function and toggle screen sleep
like that and we can basically say this
touchscreen sleep is equal to the
opposite of this screen sleep and that
will be a boolean so we'll just quickly
make that up here screen sleep boolean
will initialize that to false so every
time we call this toggle button it's
gonna say it the screen sleep is the
opposite of what it is right now and
then we'll use the this table right so
we'll integrate it with the brightness a
plug-in and we'll say it's set to keep
screen on to whatever that this screen
sleep is
inside of all home to HTML let's make a
button to this the click event will be
toggle screen sleep and for the text
will simply say screen sleep if the
screen is on we'll say don't keep the
screen on and if it's not on will say
keep the screen on so you can see our
button it's currently false so we saying
keep the screen on if we click that and
make it true we get don't keep the
screen on so you are toggling between
whether you want to keep the screen on
off on my Android device at least it
doesn't appear that the set brightness
is actually changing the brightness of
the device itself for example if I put
the brightness to zero and then I go off
the application the brightness goes back
to what it was prior to saying it within
the app but then if I toggle back in the
brightness is still zero at the moment
for this app so that's something to keep
in mind that you can't change the
brightness of the entire phone but you
can't change the brightness of the
device so this is why when we're
pressing get brightness you might get
inconsistent results if maybe your
brightness is zero here but on the phone
it's one I II you've got a maxed out on
your phone and if you pressed get
brightness and you're wondering why it
says zero when it's obviously not a zero
if you look at the brightness within the
phone itself it's because of the
brightness is restricted to this app
