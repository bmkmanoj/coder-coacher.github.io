toolbar in more detail so we've imported
the MD toolbar module from angular
material we've also added it to the
imports and exports of our shared module
at this moment and time were then using
it inside of our art component door HTML
and we've also entered the color primary
attributes let's take a look at how we
can add another role to our toolbar
let's add an MD toolbar raw component
and then we'll add a span which simply
says second row if we save our file
you'll notice that we do get the second
raw inside of our toolbar we could
simply do this again and then we'd have
a third row a fourth row and as many as
you want so one thing about the material
toolbar is that does not force any
positioning of the content so if we
wanted to have our content perhaps on
the left with an action on the right we
could do that with is simple flexbox
let's create another span that simply
says delete I'm going to zoom out of the
project and if we wanted that delete to
be all the way to the right wiki create
another span but this time given a class
such as fill space
we could define the fel space class on
our app component don't CSS if we simply
add a flex of one one auto you'll see
elderly button or delete text at this
point does get shoved over to the
right-hand side if we head back over to
our app component the HTML we can also
change the color of our toolbar for
example we could use the accent color
and at this moment in time this would
give us the pink we could also use one
to give us a red color of course this
can be changed as you can theme material
design applications relatively easy so
that's about it afford the MD toolbar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
