three so I've made a new application by
running ionic starts my model and we're
going to do that based on the blank
template after which I'm going to CD
into my model and then we're going to
open up MVS chord Mel can head over to
source pages and home doc PS this is our
home page and within the home page we'll
need to import model controller from
ionic angular as well as that will me to
inject model controller by saying
private model model controller inside of
our constructor I want to remove nap
controller from the imports because we
won't be neither in this example then
inside of all home to HTML has changed
the title to model and I'm also going to
add a blue color for the navbar secondly
inside of our ion content we'll have a
button and the button will simply say
open model will add the ion button
attributes and then we'll also give it a
click event
when the user clicks the button will set
open model so let's write the open model
function inside of horn PS if we write
open model inside of here we can see
this model and then we get access to
either config or create we'll use the
create method and if we take a look at
what the create method takes it takes
air component now the component is of
type any so that means we can use lazy
loading in the same way that we do with
our enough controller so let's pass in
ear string the string here would have to
be the name of a page at the moment we
currently have no other pages let's fix
this so inside of our command line we
can run ionic ji page and the page will
simply be called model page if we take a
look at our model page PS the name of
the class is model page so let's copy
that and add it to our this model create
we can then assign a the creation of the
model to a variable so let's say Const
my model is equal to this dot model dot
create
finally to shore the model will have to
say in line model dot present so if we
save the file we can then that run ionic
in the browser by running ionic lab if
we were then to click open model we find
we have our model page if we remove the
slush ion a globe from localhost we can
check to see how this would look on air
device and we can see that if we were on
a larger device fan air mobile form
screen we would have a common model this
would include the backdrop and if we
click the backdrop we can Claus the
model if we add slash ionic lab to the
end of our local host eight 100's we
find out that we can't currently get rid
of this model page so let's fix that by
changing our model page to add something
called ion buttons now iron buttons
allows us to add buttons to our navbar
and align them at particular locations
so if we say button and within the
button will have claws we'll give it the
iron button attributes and we'll also
give it a click event and inside of the
quick event we will add floors model
and we can add the end to our iron
buttons and this will actually align the
button to the end of the navbar so if we
open at the model again we now see we
have a close button obviously if we
click it it's not going to work because
we haven't implemented to the function
sort let them format that function let's
add Klaus model and to close the model
we'll need to import something called
view controller
I'm going to remove the nav controller
because we won't need that so I'll get
rid of an olive-oil constructor and then
we'll be using nav params later on so
I'm going to change that from public to
private
and then after injecting the Napper arms
let's inject private view of type view
controller
we can then use this view dismiss inside
of our clause model function this will
dismiss the current view ie the modal
page and will be back on the home screen
let's take a look at this inside of the
project if we press open model and then
click close we of course dismiss the
model view
let's head back to our home dot PS and
now we'll have a look at passing some
data from the model itself over to the
model page so if we add a comma after
declaring the components when we create
our model we can add some data
the data can be of type any circuit is
not a number a string or an object
let's create an object by using constant
my data is equal to and then within the
data I will simply have nm of Paul
Halliday and occupation developer now
this data could be anything
but at the moment we are just simply
going to have name and occupation inside
of an object to pass that object along
to the next page we can make an object
here and say the data object is equal to
my data this means when we come to get
the data in the next page we can get the
data object from enough params we'll
have a look at that inside of our mortal
page so inside of our model page PS
we can hook into the iron viewdidload or
the iron view will Lord's lifecycle Hoke
and then we can say this dot now proms
get and that matches up to our this
model dot create and then we pass end
the name of the mortal page and any data
that we want to pass along if this
instead was named we'd have to change
this to name inside of our model page
so now we'll put it back to being data
after we get the data I'm going to log
out be data so let's say Const that is
equal to this Dom a parameter F gets
better
so if we now click up open model we get
the object named Paul Holiday and
occupation developer that comes from the
model page PS and it's fired by saying
console.log data and data is this don't
a parameter get and the data object
when we are closing the model we can
also pass some data back to the homepage
we can do this by making some data
inside of Klaus model
so perhaps inside of Klaus model we
would have a different set of data and
we could make that equal to min John
Doerr and John doors occupation is in
milkman
so this stage we could say this don't
view not dismiss and we can pass along
some data
you can see that we can also pass other
things along when we are dismissing the
view but if we are debtor here and save
the file we could then head back over to
our home TS and inside of home duty s we
made an instance of the model by saying
a constant my model is equal to this
model create and if we take a look at
with the create function we can see that
it returns a model this is shown by the
: model as a return type of this
function this type is inferred by type
scripts when we hover over our my model
but we could imports model from ionic
angular and say my model is of type
model within the my model we can see my
model on it did dismiss and that's
called whenever the view controller has
successfully dismissed and the view
controller in this instance is the model
page which is here this top view to
dismiss and we're passing along the data
so we can see when it has dismissed
we can hook into the callback and we can
console the log out any data so if we
have a look inside of the browser we
first open the model and we get a name
Paul Holliday with occupation of
developer and that's because it's logged
out in the iron view will Lourdes then
when we close the model we get near
Madge on door occupation of Nachman and
that's because in homes RTS we've hopped
into this on it did dismiss event which
has the data callback that we can then
log out to the console similar to other
life cycle events we also have my model
got on will dismiss and this is called
whenever the view is about to dismiss so
we could contour the log I'm about to
dismiss and then we could log out the
data and in the other example we could
console the log i have dismissed and
then log all the data once again
if we save this we see the standard
result and now if we clear the console
we get a MOBOT to dismiss first then the
data and then we have I have dismissed
then the data once again so there might
be different times where you need to act
with the data as soon as possible and we
did put that in on will dismiss and
other times words are not as important
we can have that on on did this mess
there are also other use cases for the
lifecycle hikes but now let's have a
look at options so we can import from
ionic angular model options and we can
say Const my model options is of type
model options and as equal to let's also
refactor our my data to save my model
data so that we can keep our variables
consistent and then if we take a look at
the model options interface we see that
we have a variety of options that we can
set on the model for example we can
determine whether we want to show the
backdrop we can also make it so that
people can't click the backdrop to
dismiss the model and we also have a
couple of animations that we can set on
enter and leave so now let's simply say
enable backdrop dismiss is equal to
false that will mean that people can't
click on the backdrop to close in the
model and the only whether the be able
to cause is by clicking the close button
at the top right
we can pass the options long if we add a
comma after our data and then add my
model options if we take a look at this
once again on a bigger device we could
open the model and now we see the
backdrop we showed before hand that we
could click the backdrop to get rid of
the model but now if we click the
backdrop it doesn't close as always if
we click close at the top that will
close the model and we get the dismiss
events as well as the objects that about
wraps up models within ionic 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
