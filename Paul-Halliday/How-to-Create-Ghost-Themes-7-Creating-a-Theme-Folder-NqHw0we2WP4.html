first time let's open up visual studio
codes or a other editor of your choice
you can even use notepad if you want
it's entirely up to you but I'm a big
fan of Visual Studio code and you can
get that accord don't Visual Studio comm
there's other things like atom sublime
text it's entirely up to you so if we
look at the different files and folders
that we have we have things like
versions current and content all of our
work is going to be inside of content
and themes you'll notice that we have a
current theme in here and that's the
ghost default theme so we're gonna start
off by defining our own theme folder I
want you to think of a name for your
theme my themes very creatively going to
be called Paul so that folder is going
to be called Paul so that's the name of
my theme but hopefully you can come up
with a better name than that and then
you can hit enter so to start with our
theme needs three different files and
just to make sure you're in the right
directory and sure that you're inside of
this content directory and then themes
not current content and themes because
it can be confusing don't select current
and then content make sure you're in the
root content folder so each theme needs
three different files it needs an
indexed or handlebars file it needs a
post dot handlebars file and it also
needs a package.json well like what all
these different files mean later on but
for now we'll start off at the
package.json so in this lecture we've
created our theme folder and the three
files in the next lecture
we'll be looking at packaged or JSON</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
