called the ion chip now a chip allows us
to represent a particular entity inside
of this small block so this will make
sense when we actually see the UI
elements so what we need to do is head
over to our home to HTML all the
templates of your choice and change the
title here to chips and it will also
give the navbar a color of primary so
we'll start off by saying eye on chip
and we'll make it default chip which has
a level inside and we'll call this one a
basic chip if we save this and take a
look inside of our project and I am
using a basic test project here you can
actually see that we have now a basic
chip with the text inside we can go
again and we can copy this this time we
can add a color to the chip so we could
give the label a color or secondary and
we're going to call this one is
secondary chip as you can see now B text
is green so let's call this one green it
text chip instead and what we can also
do is change the color of the chip so
what we might want to do is say that the
chip potentially has the color of dark
but the level has the color of secondary
so this one will be called dark chip
green text as you can see now we have a
chip which is dark and of course has
that green text this can't be done once
again for things potentially like red if
we were to say danger and we get rid of
the level color and we could call this
one danger chips and of take like we do
get this red chips so we have a variety
of different items valve added to the
screen and we can also if we wish add
icons to these chips so let's copy that
once again this time we'll say that our
level is chip with icon and as well as
the ion label we will add an ion icon
the icon can have the name of something
like angular and we'll call this one
chip with the angular icon and I'm also
going to remove the color from the chip
that'll actually have to be neared be
log or angular instead of angular but if
we take a look no can't see that old
chip has the angular icon so you can add
any ion icon that you wish to your chips
and if you wanted to we could also take
our chip and instead of using an icon we
could add an eye on Avatar with an image
inside and the source of assets slash
avatar or JPEG the level will say the
chip with avatar and as you can see now
we have a chip with myself as an avatar
obviously I do have that image inside of
my assets folder you can also have a
chip with a button inside so let's take
the angular icon chip and we can add a
button to this will give this the ion
button and also clear our tributes and a
click events which potentially allows
the user to remove the chip so we could
say remove and pass in a reference to
this chip so we could call this one
angular chip
we'd also then have to give this a
template variable with the hashtag named
angular chip and as you can see now we
can sort of select that button and
inside of our home PS it's quite simple
we just need to make it remove function
with a chip of type elements and we can
say chip don't remove if when I'll save
this and build our application once more
we can take the ship and of course we
can remove it from the Dom so more
information on this you kind of course
check out the ionic documentation but
this is how we use chips within our
ionic projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
