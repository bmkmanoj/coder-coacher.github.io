look and buttons within ionic framework
so let's start off by making a standard
button and a standard button can be
thought of as a simple platformer themed
button so in this circumstance we'll get
a material design style button and that
can be done by saying button and also
adding the ion button attributes so once
we've done that we can then say standard
button as you can see a standard button
does appear on screen and by default
it's colored with the primary color in
this circumstance the primary color is
blue but we can change that so let's
take a look at some other colors so we
can say colored buttons and I'm going to
copy this actually I'm going to go
through and add all the colors from
variables scss as you can see we have
the following colors which is primary
like I said that one is added by default
so you don't have to specify that but we
can also add secondary danger light and
dark so the other color we can say color
equals secondary danger light and
finally color equals dark if we save
this an in them appropriately
see that we have the secondary button
the danger button be like button and
don't button here on screen so all of
these therefore a clasp as standard
buttons we can make our buttons a little
more interesting when we use something
called a Clear button
so a Clear button can be thought of as a
button with the iron button arrow buttes
but also the clear attributes let's do
the same with a standard button and if
we save the file we can instantly see
that we have a button but the button
colors have been inverted so now we have
no background color and simply blue text
it takes up the same amount of space on
the screen so for example if we hover
over and select the button we can see
that it does actually still have that
ripple effect here on Android I'm going
to copy the colored buttons I'm going to
add clear for each one of these so you
can use the other colors as well and
when we save our file we can see that we
do get the variety of different colors
we can also think like it's something
called a round button so let's add a
round buttons if we copy the clear code
but instead use the attributes of a
round and when we save the file we can
see our round buttons appear it's very
similar to the standard buttons but we
have a much more round button instead of
the rectangular button here another
potential button is what's known as the
block buttons so a block button is
simply a button with the iron button
tank and also block if we create that
and save the file you can see that the
block button is taking up the width of
the content we also have some padding
added to our iron content and that's why
there's some gaps
the other side let's take a look at a
very similar concept and that's a full
button if full button is a button with
the iron button arrow buttes and the
full attribute as you can see with the
full button it's very similar to the
block button but the full button does
not have rounded corners it certainly
does not stop there we can also play
with the button sizes so the Navy
occasions where you want a small button
a medium button and a large button let's
have a look at that we can start off by
adding a button here and giving it the
iron button era beads and the small
attribute when we give it these small
arrow butte we can therefore say small
button for a standard button we simply
need to remove the small attribute and
leave the ion button arrow beads and
finally for a large button you can
simply add large if we save our file we
can scroll down and we can see the three
different button sizes we have a small
button a standard button and in large
button we can also make old buttons more
interesting with button icons so if we
were to make a button with the iron
button attributes and the icon
- left arrow beads this would say that
an icon is to the left of this button
inside of here we can add an ion icon
and I'll use the Add icon so let's give
it the name of adds and perhaps our
button would say something like new we
can also add a button but instead of
using the icon left we can use the icon
right this means we need to take this up
one and I'm going to use add again in
this instance and we also have the
opportunity to use icon only so let
icon - or me and remove the text of MU
if we add a hatch one here seeing button
icons and we save our file we can see
that our button icons gives us the
button with an icon to the left and icon
to the right and simply an icon only
button in many circumstances you also
may want to take this icon only and also
add clear to that button and now we have
a clear button that represents just an
icon there are other things we can do
with our ionic buttons inside of the nav
bar for example inside of our ion nav
bar underneath the ion title let's add
an ion - buttons tag inside of here we
can create a button I'm going to give
this the I on button attributes and icon
only attributes I'll add the ion icon
once again this time the icon will have
the name of ads and will also be able to
place this button at the start of the
navbar and the start keywords means
there will be to the left of the title
and we also have an end keywords which
can be at the end or the right of the
title to prove this let's use the iron
buttons once more so I'm going to copy
the entirety of this components and
place it underneath but this time we'll
place it at the end we're going to use a
different button this time the icon name
will be home instead of ads and once we
save this we can see our two buttons
here appear on our navbar now on an iOS
device
the price will appear to the left of the
title and the home will appear to the
right of the title but on an android
device it will look like this so it will
depend on what operating system you're
actually running but that's how we add
icons at least to our nav bars
so in this video we've had a in-depth
ladki at all the different types of
buttons that we can create inside of our
ionic
applications I hope you found them
useful going forward as there is quite a
few customizations one for every
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
