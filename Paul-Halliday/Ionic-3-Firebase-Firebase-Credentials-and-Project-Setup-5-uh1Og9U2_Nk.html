angular fire SDK so now we can add to
our project and inside of the source
folder the app directory is our route
and G module so if you navigate to app
module TS we can import the angular fire
module and that is from angularfire to
we've done that we can head over to our
imports and we can initialize
give a fire with credentials from the
dashboards
so we can see angularfire module dot
initialize up and then we need to pass
in the configuration credentials so
let's create a file inside of the apps
folder
we'll call out 5s credentials dot TS and
we can export a constant in here so this
makes me constant accessible from
elsewhere so we can import this named
firebase underscore credentials
and we can make this equal to the
credentials on all 5s dashboards so if
we head back over to our 5s dashboard we
have this button here named add 5's to
your web application there should be
your credentials vampires here and
instead of pressing copy what I want you
to do is instead just take this object
so take everything inside of the braces
and if you copy that we can place it
back inside of our 5s credentials file
and if we just pasted over our braces
like that we should have our project
configuration settings obviously yours
is going to be different than mine and
it will contain the actual information
instead of my place order after that you
can save the file and you can close this
file then inside of our app module don
TS will need to import that firebase
credentials constant so Matt's imports
from firebase credentials we want to
import the fibrous credentials constant
when we've done that we can initialize
our angular fire up with the credentials
so we can pass through 5's underscore
credentials and as simple as that that's
all the configuration we need to do as
far as guessing firebase in our
application
we've given firebase the air PI key the
database reference URL and so on let's
take a look now we're interacting with
our database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
