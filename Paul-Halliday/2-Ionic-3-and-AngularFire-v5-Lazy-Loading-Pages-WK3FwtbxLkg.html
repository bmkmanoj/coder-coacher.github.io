the module file itself I want to
consider why we might want to make
something lazy loaded in the first place
well at this point in time it's not
absolutely necessary because our
application is going to be relatively
small but it's usually a good practice
to lazy load pages where possible so
this means that our bundle is smaller
and our application is faster so what I
recommend is going over to the pages
folder and inside of here we have a home
folder let's make a new file called home
module dot es inside of here we can
import from at angular slash core and we
want to import ng module we can then use
the ng module decorator to create a new
angular module and we can create this
class named home module we could
alternatively just delete the home
folder and recreate it with the ionic
CLI but I want to show how we could do
this from scratch sort the declarations
for our module is going to be that home
page and we also need to add some
imports and that imports is going to be
the ionic page module and that comes
from ionic angular so don't forget to
import that and we need to put dot for
child and pass through the home page at
the same time we'll need to import that
home page from home so we're essentially
saying to ionic hey this page here which
is the home page is going to be lazy
loaded in the future the final thing to
do is add at ionic Page on top of our
components and that
from ionic angular so by adding this
ionic page decorator on top of our
components we can then lazy load this
homepage inside of the app torque
component TS and lazy loading is
essentially by removing the import
statement and saying our root page is
actually a string and we just pass
through is string them of the home page
the reason we're doing it like this is
not only because it's quicker but we'll
be lazy loading every other page so we
may as well keep this consistent
throughout our application so if we save
the file the final thing that we
actually need to do is head over to app
module TS and at this point in time
we're declaring the home page as part of
our app module which would mean that
it's getting the cord and the bundle for
the home page at runtime and this is not
what we want so in order to separate
this from the bundle we can remove it
from both the declarations and entry
components and even though we are
loading the home page is a separate
bundle technically when we load our
application it now is lazy loaded likely
rest of our other pages will be so if we
run ionic lab now they should open up
our application outside of the browser
and we should be navigated to the home
page
here we have it the homepage as expected
and what we can do now is add firebase
angularfire
and start building out our application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
