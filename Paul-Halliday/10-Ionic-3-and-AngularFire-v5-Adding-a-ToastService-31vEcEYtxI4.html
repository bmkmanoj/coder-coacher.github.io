of these services folder and that's
going to be called toast so we'll have a
toast dot service don TS we can export a
class called the toast service and as we
will be injecting the toast controller
into the constructor we will need the
injectable decorator so let's import
that from angular core and then we can
inject the toast controller with a
reference to that toast controller from
ionic angular so now that we have both
of these things we can create a very
nice helper method called sha now we'll
take a message as a string and a
duration as a number but the default
duration will be three seconds so we can
return this dot toast control don't
create we can pass through both the
message and the duration and then
present this to the user so why would we
do this why wouldn't we just use the
toast controller all the time well we
may want to eat different toasts that
control are based on the environment
perhaps we have an angular application
or another application where we don't
want to use ionics toast controller or
we just want an easier API and we don't
have to keep instantiating this toast
controller instead we can just put it
inside of this service so if we quickly
save this file and head over to our app
module we can make a toast service if we
save that we can then inject this into
the Edit shopping item page as toast and
simply said this don't toast dot sure
when we save this item and we can show
at all stat says item don't name has
been saved don't forget to use the
backticks here to bind to that
particular item don't name
this is how we make what's known as a
template literal inside of es6 or es2015
if you haven't seen this before I do
have videos on this so I definitely
suggest you check them out let's do the
same for our ad shopping item let's add
our toast service and when we decide to
add the item we can say toast added so
if we want to add a new product such as
the MacBook Pro we could say quantity
one price of 2000 and we hit add you can
see that we now get this toast at the
bottom of the screen if we go and change
this to instead be quantity two and hit
save
we get the Edit shopping item it's not a
function
and I'm not sure why because I have then
restarted I in a glob and it's just
worked entirely so perhaps there was a
slight bug there but nonetheless it
works now we can go through and edit
that product so we can see that we have
my bug Pro has been saved so we now have
this little service which we can call to
this toast here and we can display an
item on screen if we wanted to add a
duration for this we certainly could
maybe we wanted that one to be 5,000 but
I like the default of 3,000 so what is
that to do next well at this point in
time we can currently edit the item by
selecting it but at this point in time
we currently do not have the ability to
delete the item so maybe on this edit
screen when we select edit shopping item
we want the ability to then hit delete
instead of civ so let's take a look I'm
at in at the next light charm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
