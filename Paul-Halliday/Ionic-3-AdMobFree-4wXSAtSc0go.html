adding AdMob free to our ionic
applications so I'm going to start off
by making in new project named AdMob
free based on the blank template so this
allows us to add the Google AdMob
platform to our applications
we can then display banner ads which
cover up a small section of the screen
and interstitial ads which cover up the
entire screen now there are two versions
of this plug-in there is the AdMob pro
plugin otherwise simply known as AdMob
and that plug-in takes money or
royalties after you earn a particular
amount whereas this one at this moment
in time hence the name free does not you
may wish to luck at both plugins to see
which one is right for you and your
project but nonetheless you will
actually require an AdMob account when
we're doing this we can do enticing mode
so you won't actually need one for this
plugin but if you do obviously want to
put this into production and start
earning money from ads then you will
need to replace the test ID and is
testing which we will work out later on
with your actual AdMob ID so let's CB
into AdMob free and from here we can of
course add the ionic Cordova plug-in for
the Cordova plug-in AdMob free hit yes
to installing the COI plugin for Cordova
and the next thing to do is run NPM
install at ionic native slash AdMob free
you will need to add - - save if you're
not running NPM five and above once
we've done that we can say called dot
alternatively you can open this up in
whatever editor that you want and then
we can head over to our root our module
TS
we'll have to import from ionic native
slash AdMob free the AdMob free plugin
so this here is the ionic native wrapper
for that and then of course we can add
this to the providers like so now we can
head over to either the provider that
you want or simply the component in
which you want to show this and I will
remove the nav controller for now
because we won't need that
then we'll see privates admob of type
AdMob free let's inject to add more pre
once again and we can start off by
initially saying sure banner ads and
here we can determine some of banner ads
config so let's say find a config and
this will be of type AdMob free planner
config let's take a look at that
interface as you can see we have things
like an ad unit ID whether the adverts
is a test ads whether we want to auto
show the ads and a variety of other
contact options now this config option
is similar to the paid version of this
plugin and you'll notice that we also
have some interfaces for the future
contact options that we'll be looking at
so let's set our banner config we can
start off with the ID so the ID here
will be something like CA pub and then
we might have a particular number that
comes from your AdMob console and then
we can say is testing for now equal to
true and we can also add things like
Auto Show equal to true and because we
have Auto Show enabled we don't have to
actually call sure banner ads but we'll
look at that in a second if you wanted
to you could also enable banner atop
equal to true and that which should be
bun at the top of the screen instead of
the bottom I'm going to remove that too
now and also let's just comment out this
so we don't get any errors similar to
the paid plugin we then have to set our
banner config and that can be done by
the this AdMob banner and I'm going to
call this AdMob free actually instead
just so we don't get mixed up with what
plugin we are using we'll pass in that
banner config and now I'm going to make
this function an async function so we
can now determine with a try/catch
whether we can assure this ad and that
can be done by seeing the AdMob freed
banner dot prepare to add a result here
if everything has been done correctly
because we have this all offshore
enabled the banner show - or we can
console but log the results let's
consult our are any errors
this inside of all constructor and you
can hug the center and event as well if
you want we could say something like
this dot show banner ads I'm then going
to run this on the device
run on the device by saying ionic
cordova run and then the platform that
you want such as Android - L this will
run on the Android device and of course
we've added live reload so any changes
that we make on the desktop or
automatically be changed to honor the
phone
so on my device we have in advil on the
bottom of the screen we can't see this
here in the dev tools but you can see
that we did get all care in the console
and this of course does reflect the fact
that these ads are being shown so we now
have a Sean banner ads and the next
thing to do is to shorten in especial
ads now on interstitial I do you may
have seen them is one that takes up the
entire screen so now that we've shown
our banner ads we can make a function
named Shaw interstitial ads and we can
add air sync to this I've also gone
ahead and put the config inside of this
try-catch block just to make things a
little neater and we can do the same
here by making another try-catch block
and this time we'll make an interstitial
config of type AdMob free in the special
config and remember that comes from
ionic native slash AdMob free and this
has a similar interface as our banner
art we have things like an ID whether we
are testing and whether we want to show
the ads when loaded so let's put in a
place all the for our ID let's add is
testing equal to true and Auto Show also
equal to true similar to before we can
set this to AdMob free dot in this
special dot config and pass in that
config
let's now say constant results equal to
a wait distant AdMob free the
interstitial dot prepare now as we have
Auto Show enabled it will automatically
show our ads
so let's log this on to the console as
well so I'm also now going to shown in
the special ad here inside of the
constructor
notice how we now get to orchids be
first or care comes from the banner and
the second Orca comes from the end of
special ads once again we can't see this
inside of the developer tools but you
will be able to see this on the phone
now let's do the same for a video ad so
we can make an async sure video rewards
ad and you know the gig by now or to try
catch with a console or of a we can make
it video rewards content
can import to the AdMob free reward
video config and we can assign this
constant here that type and we can make
that equal to and once again we have the
options of ID we have is testing equal
to true and Auto Show equal to true
let's set our config by seeing now
reward video config equal to that video
rewards config after which we can
display this by seeing prepare and I'm
going to add this to a result once again
and the aware keywords and we can
console the log the result instead of
shown the interstitial I am going to
comment this out and I am going to send
this dot short video rewards ad and if
we save this our app will build once
again and this time our reward video
will be fired this will show the user a
reward video instead of the end of
special art but your ma decided does
take up the entire screen and when we
are testing it does show the
interstitial ad when you add your
production ID though it should show the
appropriate response
so that wraps up how we might integrate
the AdMob free plugin inside of our
ionic applications
