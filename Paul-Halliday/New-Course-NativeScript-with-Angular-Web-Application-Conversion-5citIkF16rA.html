of scripting comm and it's called native
script with angular web application
conversion and a lot might sound complex
what this actually does is it looks at
making a similar web application with
the same angular code base so not only
do we make in native script app but we
also make a web app using angular so on
the front end we have angular material
and on the mobile app we either have an
iOS view or an angular material design
view to do that we use the team of
Meister or angular native seed and if we
take a look at the files here you'll see
that we have a home module dot T and s
dot TS and a home module dot TS anything
that has the dot TNS inside of the file
name will be specific to native script
only outside of that dot TS files are
specific to the web application and you
will find that we can then it create
these two applications that marry side
by side from this singular codebase and
this is really important too when it
comes to making consistent mobile apps
that also have a web counterparts
because one of the main reasons that
people use a frameworks like ionic is so
that we can make that application that's
both cross-platform on the web and of
course on the device but you'll find it
by using native script on the team of
Maestro seed is that of course you can
have a native application with still
having that web counterparts using
services and obviously providers now one
of the main reasons that people use
frameworks such as ionic is so that they
can have a mobile web application and at
the same time that app can be deployed
to a website as something like a pw
where now you can take these same
principles using the native scrub side
of things using the team maestro seed
and that's what we talk about inside of
this course so by the end of the course
you'll have made an app that not only
works on the mobile device but also
works on the web too another thing that
we look at inside of the course is
things like using native and web toasts
so if we'd simply play a little bit of
this lecture you can see that for
example we use the angular material
tossed here on the web and for native
script we actually use the specific need
of plugin for it toast so all in all
it's a course that is really exciting
because at the end of the day you'll be
able to make applications for the web
and at the same time you'll be able to
make those native mobile apps you'll be
able to take advantage of the power that
a native app does provide and at the
same time you'll be able to deploy these
things straight to the web so that's
over native scripting comm and you can
find a link to that inside of the
description of this video if you are
interested in learning ng our ranks I do
have an ng rx course over at native
scripting comm as well now at this point
in time it does use the previous version
of ngrick store and ng rx effects but
I'm looking to upgrade this in the near
future I simply wanted to release the
web app conversion course first and
we'll go back to upgrading the Antioch
store and effects for angular version 5
so all of that is over native scripting
com thanks a lot for watching and if you
do purchase I'll see you inside
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
