native script view once again and this
time we'll be investigating the midde
script up info plugin let's create a new
native script up by saying TNS creates
and our application will be called NS
view of info it we use the templates
native scripts - view - templates this
will of course start us with a new
native script view project and from then
on we can add the app info plugin
awesome this has been created so we can
see D into NS view up info and then we
can set TNS plugin adds native script -
app info this allows us to find
different things about our application
such as the build number the app name
and so on has been successfully
installed we can run code or to open
this up inside of our editor and then I
will run this on the iOS simulator with
TNS run iOS as always I will be using
the app dot GS template and I'll be
removing everything apart from the
require native script - view slash dist
slash index this allows us to use the
view instance inside of our app the next
thing I'm going to do is make it Const
up info and this will require the native
script - app info we can then make it a
new view instance and we'll also add dot
dollar starts to the end of our view
instance and this will allow us to start
up our application and of course our app
will be blank
this will first require a template a
template will simply be a page and it
will have an action bar like so we'll
give this action bar the title of
application info and when I save my file
you can then I see that we get this
blank app so if you're not aware already
view has a numerous amount of lifecycle
hugs that
we can hook into and the one that I'll
be looking at is the created lifecycle
hook inside of created I will be
guessing all of our information so we
can say things like app info dot and
then we have things like get up ID which
does return us a promise so we can see
the app ID can be equal to this don't
app ID like so we could then create a
stack layout underneath our action bar
and the spark way out can have labels
with the text equal to upper ID when our
application initially lured so you can
then see that we have this oak don't
need a script or NS view up in fall
that's the ID of our bundle we can make
this a little nicer to read if we're to
surround this in backticks and simply
say app ID and then use template binding
to display our expression so we
currently have the app ID let's get the
build number so we can do the same by
then displaying the build number on
screen by adding it to a label and when
doing so we should see our build number
when our application does refresh you
can see that our build number is
currently 1.0 and finally we can do
things like app info don't get a version
name if we got the version name and we
simply said this don't version name
equal to our bike Tech's version name we
then be able to display this on screen
inside of our text binding within the
label so hopefully you can see just how
awesome native script view is and how
easy it is to interact with the plugins
such as the app info plugin thanks a lot
