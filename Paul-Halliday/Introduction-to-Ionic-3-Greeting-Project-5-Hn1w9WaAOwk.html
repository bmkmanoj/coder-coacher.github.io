home page we can hold the value of the
person's mem that we want to greet so
let's make ourselves a class-wide
variable named person nem we can make
that of type stream by adding a call on
after the variable mem and then of
course seeing that this is ear string so
now that we have access to that person
name we can head back to home dot HTML
and on our ion inputs we can add an NG
model we can assign the value of the ng
model equal to that person name variable
at a very high level all you need to
understand here is that the ng model is
a two-way binding between the person
named variable and our input so
essentially anything that changes person
name whether it is something
programmatically inside of our type
script or whether it's the user changing
it in the view it will update that input
so when the user types in to the inputs
our variable is updated inside of our
class as a results we can make a short
greeting function this your grating can
also take a person in and before
any further let's simply use console
button log to log the near mail to the
console so when the user hits that
assure greeting button we can see what's
inside the value of our name so if we
head back to home to HTML we can add a
click event on this button the click
event will fire this your greeting
function and we'll pass in the person
name as air parameter now we could also
console dot log this person them and
effectively it would be the same thing
but the reason we're adding it here as a
parameter as it just makes our function
more flexible and more testable so as
you can see now when the user heads this
button the show greetings function will
fire
and the person named for example what
the user has typed on this input box
will be sent to that function so in
order to see this if you right click and
hit inspect and for now we'll just move
this to one platform and if I type in
Paul how are there as an EM and I click
show greeting you can see here the
inside of the console is being in that
we typed in
we change this we get the updated
version of that name each time the user
selects something new let's now look at
how we can display it tossed it to the
user so a lo a lot box when they hit
that's your greeting button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
