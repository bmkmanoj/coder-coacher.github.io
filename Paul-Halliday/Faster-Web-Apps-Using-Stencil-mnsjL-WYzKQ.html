this video we'll be looking at the
stencil compiler it's a tool built by
the ionic framework team and it allows
us to build fast web applications using
web components
after imagine it's going to be the basis
of future versions of ionic framework
which should allow ionic to work with
things like react view or any front-end
framework that you desire
the awesome thing is because they are
simply web components nor framework at
all would also be a good alternative but
going forward let's take a look at the
stencil starter so we can use get corn
on HTTP github.com slash ionic - team
slush stencil - starter don't get this
will call us the starter repository
and providing with speller correctly we
will then be able to see the enter
stencil starter before going any further
we can run npm install to install any
dependencies inside of the project and
then of course we can run this with npm
run dev
we'll serve our application inside of
the browser and watch for any file
changes so to get started let's take a
look at our stencil config
inside of our stencil config GS we have
a following list of components inside of
our bundle
if we want to declare a new component we
have to add it to this component a rare
before adding a new component though
let's take a look at how its defined and
what a component looks like if we take a
look under the source components my name
directory we have a file called my name
TSX and this is a common theme across
all of the stencil components everything
runs as a TSX file and if you've used
things like react in the past this
should be no surprise as to what our
application component looks like the
component is declared with a decorator
we import that from stencil call we can
assign this ed time which we saw earlier
as my name the style URL for this
component is under my name dot s CSS
to angular we don't have to define a
style URL we could of course define
these manually
next we head over to our export class of
my name
and the first thing we see is two
properties now profit is imported from
stencil core and essentially this is a
read-only input into this component
so this allows us to have a 1 we're
binding inside of the component
so properties allow us to have that
input on the element but we can also
have local components that by using at
state this could be called my variable
perhaps you'd have this a string and
we'd need to import States from spent or
call
as you can see inside of our index dot
HTML we're defining our components the
same where we define any other
components in a modern-day framework we
have a XHTML tags with property types
here such as first and last that way you
can see that we have my name is
stenciled GS here on screen and that's
because we have those input property
types here on the component we also have
events that we can hook into similar to
components will Lourdes and perhaps we
want to log something out to the console
such as loading you can then see when we
refresh our page we do get that loading
inside of the console and all of these
things allow for a consistent and nice
to use web components library stencil is
still relatively new some may have got
some of these things wrong as it's not
currently released but this video should
hopefully serve to add to the
conversation about where the direction
of ionic and web components are going in
the future if you're interested in ionic
and you'd like to check out my course
learn ionic theory from scratch don't
forget to check out Paul Halliday or i/o
and of course the link for that is
inside of the description you can use
the coupon code half to get the cause
for it pound at the moment sort of
exceptionally cheap for about nine ten
hours of content so it's certainly a
worthwhile investment if you're looking
to up your angular and ionic skills
until then my name is Paul and I'll see
you very soon in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
