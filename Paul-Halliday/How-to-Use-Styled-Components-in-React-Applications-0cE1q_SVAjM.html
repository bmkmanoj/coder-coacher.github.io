at using styled components in the
context of our react to applications so
we can start off by running NPM install
styled - components I've already created
a react application with Korea react up
and I suggest that you do the same after
that we can open this up inside of our
editor and I will head over to ArcGIS
and I'm going to remove the local and
CSS for now and also everything inside
of our render function so we simply just
have this return the first thing that
we'll do is import styled from a styled
component and outside of our class we
can go ahead and create ourselves a
component a component is simply if
function and as you can see right here
if we created a titled component such as
constant title we could set up as equal
to styled dot h1 and if we take a look
here before we select the h1 we have
everything from air to P h2 h3 and so on
everything that you would expect after
that whatever what do you do is actually
select this a backtick so instead of
doing some parenthesis use the backtick
instead and then here we can pass a
variety of parameters everything inside
of here will be CSS and the first
parameter will be the color of blue
we'll also change the font size of our
title to be a hundred pixels
we can then go ahead and render our
title inside of the render function now
place this inside of a dev for now and
inside of the dev we will add our title
components our title will simply say my
styled title if we go ahead and run our
application in the browser with NPM
starts you can see that we get this my
style title it was just that simple to
create a styled component they give us a
blue h1 with the font size of 100 if we
wanted to go ahead and create another
styled component for example if we made
a Const underlined paragraph make it be
equal to is styled dot P with a similar
template tag this time we could have a
color of pale violet red and the texture
decoration of underline if we added this
inside of our div underneath our title
so we added underlined paragraph we
could say my underlined paragraph all we
now need to do is save this in our
styled component will appear underneath
the title as you can see we now have my
underlined paragraph underneath the
title so integrating styled components
inside of our reactor applications is
super simple and it's not necessarily
restricted to react so you can use this
in whatever framework or even on
framework that you wish and you can see
then it makes it super easy to add CSS
inside of our JavaScript I'd love to
