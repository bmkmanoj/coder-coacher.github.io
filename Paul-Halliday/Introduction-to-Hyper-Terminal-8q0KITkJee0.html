terminal is and how they can set their
terminal up in a similar web
well my terminal is hyper by site and of
course this is a JavaScript HTML and CSS
terminal that is completely open-source
inspectable and has a respectable amount
of plugins it's quite easy to expend and
has a redox pattern as far as I'm aware
for actually making plugins so you can
hug into different stages of the Upstate
let's get this downloaded go to this
hyper dot is and I'll put a link to this
inside with the description and of
course I'm going to download on Mac OS
so here we are we've downloaded hyper
but the terminal doesn't look the way
that mine does and that's because I've
got some third-party plugins and
configuration to get started configuring
the settings for our terminal we can
open this up inside of our editor by
opening up the hyper GS file and from
within here we have a variety of config
so we can do everything from the font
size to the font family as well as a
variety of other things I'm going to
head down to the plugins section of the
config and I'm going to uncomment this
and if we take a look at each one over
the plugins themselves we can get an
idea of what each one of them does the
hyper term material is the simple
material theme that I use hyper power
gives us that cool effect when we type -
CWD allows us to open a new tab in the
same directory the hyper border
obviously gives us that crazy gradient
border the hyper term tab icons allow us
to have tab icons so self-explanatory
hyper blink allows our cursor to blink
and the hyper turn cursor allows us to
see the character of whatever is
underneath the cursor when we're typing
you can see a full list of plugins
inside of the description I'll link it
to the github section where you can see
everything from productivity increases
to fun additions such as gifts nyan cat
and more and other customizations so if
we save this file and then check back
over in our terminal you see our
terminal has reloaded with those plugins
if you find that your terminal has not
real ordered to install these plugins
you can force the terminal to real
or alternatively you can just restart
the terminal after which your terminal
should like it similar to mine and you
can customize the plugins individually
and change it however you like so that
wraps up the terminal video let me know
what you think and share me your
configurations of hyper I'd love to see
what you come up with and if you make
any plugins I'd love to hear about -
until next time I know is full and I'll
see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
