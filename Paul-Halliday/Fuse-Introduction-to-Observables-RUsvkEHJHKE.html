at using observables inside of our fuse
applications I've gone ahead and made a
new fuse up by saying fuse create up and
the name of my app is of course fuse
observables after which I've run that CD
fuse observables and then I'll open this
up inside of our editor by saying corded
ops we'll be looking at this in the
context of user inputs and we'll be
using a very simplified example but if
you've used things like rxjs before or
you've seen the observable pattern
before then you should have a basic idea
at least of what an observable is it
essentially allows us at a very basic
level to subscribe to a stream of data
which makes it very useful for user
interface views and things like form
inputs inside Vout we can head over to
men view UX and we can add in mute AG
for JavaScript and inside of our
JavaScript tank we want to require the
fuse Jass observable so let's make it
var observable equal to require 50s
slash observable after which I want to
export a variable named nem in which we
can display this name on screen so that
will be an observable of Paul now in
this circumstance we also could simply
just assign this to the string of Paul
and at this moment in time we would get
the exact same response but let's make
it not observable so we can see the
changes on screen so this here is
require to use observables
and this is our observable data so
because of export foods our observable
what we can then do is display this data
on screen and subscribe to that
observable so if we made it text and we
give this the value of nem and then
inside of our terminal we can run fuse
preview and this will open up our
project and any changes that we make
will be live reloaded so at the very top
left of the screen we have this name
equal to Paul just to make this a little
easier to read I'm going to add some
font size of something like 200 so our
replication else is pull on screen and
this is an observable value so this
means that this value if we edited this
variable this would update to our UI to
prove that this is the case we can also
make it text view and that text view can
have the value F name once again and the
font size of 200 I will add this inside
of a stunt panel so that each one of
these items are on top of one another
so right now you see that we have this
text at the top and the textview on the
bottom if we change this variable to
instead say dev you can see that our top
text updates and this is because that
information has been updated live
because we're subscribing to the
observed data to prove that this is
actually observable if we remove the
observable and the parenthesis and we
simply assign this to be Paul and if we
went ahead and change this to dev you
can see that the top tanks that does not
change and this is because this variable
here or this value here in the view is
not necessarily been subscribed to so
it's not an observable piece of data
when we make things and observable and
bind it to the view fuse is
automatically subscribing to the
observable and therefore watching for
any changes we can also take this a
little bit further if we wanted to run
some particular chord when the value
changes on screen so this is run chord
when the value changes and what I'm
going to do is change this TV var name
instead of exporting at this point and
we're going to say name dot on value
changed we need to pass in the current
module this is just for scoring and we
can also add a function which returns us
the current item on screen so you even
call this name so if we were to console
dot log and perhaps say something like
current value plus nem and we'll keep
everything es5 for now and what we want
to do is export the name object once
again I've taken this out of compact
view and if I go ahead and change the
text view you can see at the bottom left
of
the screen that the current value is
changing we get that console.log with
the current value and each time we add
something to our text view that is
logged out to the console so that's how
we can perform particular actions when
if value has changed so at this point
things like validators would be good to
add or anything else that depends on the
current value of this editable item we
can also perform things like math on our
observable and these are things we'll
get into in the future videos but for
now I just wanted to cover a very basic
implementation of observables inside of
views don't forget to check out Paul
Halliday don't I or for more courses and
free videos and until on time and that
subscribe button to stay updated and
I'll see you soon in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
