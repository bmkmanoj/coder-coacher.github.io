application with fuse so ensure you've
got fuse downloaded and then run fuse
creates up and then the nem power up is
going to be camera we can then see B
into camera and open this up the inside
of your editor the first thing I'm going
to do is inside of our men view UX I'm
go to creates a JavaScript
Nords and inside of our JavaScript here
I'm going to import both the observable
from fuse GS / observable and camera
from a few GS / camera I'm then going to
create a variable named picture and
picture itself is going to be at the
moment it default camera icon but when
we take a picture with the camera it'll
change to that camera image outside of
that the chord is relatively simple
we'll need to make ear function and I'm
going to call this function take picture
and from within the function we're going
to access that camera object and with a
say camera to take picture and from here
we can pass in the dimensions at the
moment I'm just going to say 640 by 480
and then we have the access to this then
callback which contains the image and we
can set the value of our picture equal
to that image if there are any errors we
can catch these and for now we'll simply
see their console dot error and pass in
any error aside from that we should be
able to export this to our up by saying
module to exports and of course passing
in that picture and take picture
function so as far as the view I want a
panel and this panel will contain our
image it will initially have that press
all the image but when we take a photo
it will be replaced with the photo that
we take so I'm going to line this to the
top by saying alignment top
then from within side of the panel we
can add an image we'll give this the UX
mm of image and the file path to the
image can be equal to that picture as we
using an image inside of our images
folder for example this camera here as a
place order we'll have to tell fuse
about that and we can do that by adding
it to our includes from our Cameroon or
project and this is essentially seeing
that we want to add anything inside of
the images folder that ends in a dot PNG
to our bundle so if nobody's taking a
photo at this point we should have that
best photo and now all we need is a
button to hook up that functionality so
you might have another panel but this
time we might align it in the middle and
inside of that panel we have a button
the text of our button would be equal to
take picture and the clicked event would
be equal to that take picture function
so if we now click this button we would
get the take picture function and all
this does is say hey fuse camera take a
photo and give me the results of that we
are then putting that results into this
picture variable which we're subscribing
to inside of our image here any time
this variable is updated this image will
be updated and the final thing that we
need to do is actually add this fuse GS
/ comer to our project and we can do
this by adding it to the list of
packages so we can add fuse camera to
this package list and when we run our
project it will download the fuse camera
dependency and of course then run it on
our device so now that we've done Ola
let's run fuse preview and I'm going to
add the target of Android if I then it
click take picture we get asked whether
we want to give the camera permission so
I'm going to click allow and our camera
appears on-screen if I take a photo and
click OK the results of our picture is
then shown on the application obviously
we've got very very simple
implementation for your camera but so
that's how you implement
nonetheless so this about wraps up how
you can easily implement the camera in
your fuse applications if you're
enjoying the few series let me know in
the comments section below I know quite
a few people in the previous video have
said that they want to see more fuse so
let's add more fuse to the channel if
you like this and that subscribe button
and I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
