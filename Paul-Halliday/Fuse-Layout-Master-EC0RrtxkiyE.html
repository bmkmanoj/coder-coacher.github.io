using the layout master within fuse this
allows us to trigger a layout animation
on various different panels and as
you'll see it does provide a very smooth
layout experience
so we'll start off by having a root
panel and that panel will have two other
panels
they'll be inside a vest and panel on
top of one another and we'll use this to
house two panels with text inside so
let's add some text and we'll set the
text equal to click me we'll set the
height of this panel to be 100 and we'll
align the text in the center we'll copy
this and do the same for another panel
this time the panel will say click me to
and we'll use this to determine what
somebody has clicked on this element we
can fire a clicked event we'll lock it
firing that in a moment instead what I
want to do is create a rectangle above
this will make the color of this
rectangle red for now and at this moment
you will see that it does take up the
entire page but what I want to do is add
a layout animation so what the layout
animation allows us to do is any time
that we select one of the text elements
we're going to fire this layout
animation for now we will simply just
add a move on a mission I can move
relative to the world position change it
will take one second to do so
and we'll add some easing equal to
elastic in out so we now have a right
angle we've got two text elements and
whenever we select two these text
elements I want to change what's known
as the layout master so in order to set
a default layout master I'm going to
give a UX name to both of these panels
or simply call this one panel one
and the second panel - then inside of
our rectangle here we can set the layout
master equal to panel 1 and notice how
the rectangle now only takes up that
first panel and that's because we've set
the layout master saw what this
rectangle does is effectively now takes
the height and width of that panel and
this would also be the fact if I said
panel two would go from a panel one to
panel two because it only takes up the
width and height and position of panel
two so this gives us some unique
properties because what we can do now
was anytime that we changed that layout
master what we can then do is add it
move animation so this opens up some
interesting doors because what we can
then do is start animating this change
so inside of our panel will add a
clicked tag and in here we can set
particular attributes so let's add a set
and in order to set the layout master at
any time this element is clicked we need
to give the rectangle a UX name so let's
give this a UX name of my rent and we
can simply say my rect don't layout
master is equal to panel 1
let's now copy this and add this to the
second panel but instead of panel 1
we'll say a panel 2 now if we select our
rectangle you can see that it does flip
between both panels but our move
animation doesn't trigger and that's
because we need to add an X and y like
so by adding an x and y it allows fuse
to determine how it should move this
rectangle at the same time is moving it
to the new panel so if we said X 10 + y
10 and then selected a new panel you can
see that almost flies off-screen when we
select a new rectangle and that's
because we've given different X&amp;amp;Y
positions
let's change the width of our panel to
be 50 instead you'll notice that when we
select the new panel the rectangle only
takes up 50 but let's move the X&amp;amp;Y to be
1 and also add a resize event so we can
say that we want to resize this and we
want to do it relative to the size
change give this an X and y of 1 again
and this time of gyration of 2 we need
to add relative to here and once we do
that and we select the rectangle you can
see that the rectangle itself fills up
or decrements head size depending on
which layout it's taking up this takes
two seconds to do so and we have a quite
interesting UI effect here and I think
the great thing about this is that you
can get as creative as you want with the
layout animations you can find more
about this on the fuse documentation and
the wealth of examples this year as part
of an example on the few site and I
think it's a really good showcase of the
power of animations and moveable items
