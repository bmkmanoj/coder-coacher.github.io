small accessible and talking 1 kilobyte
small tooltips well this is a CSS only
tool tip library that allows us to
create tooltips and I'll be
investigating it inside of this video so
let's first create a new directory
called micro and then it will make an
indexed or HTML like so and at the same
time I'm gonna run NPM install HTTP
server - G this will allow us to open up
a hedge TTP server inside of this folder
after that we can open this up inside a
visual studio chords and run HTTP server
on this directory so the first thing we
need to do is head over to index dot
HTML and create a new HTML document I'm
using Emmet if you haven't checked out
my Emmet video I definitely suggest you
do that on my channel then we can hit
tab and this snorts us outs within new
HTML document with all the boilerplate
the title I'm simply going to say a
micro tab so inside of the heads and
make a new link with the relation of a
stylesheet and the reference at HTTP
unpackage comm slash micro tip slash
micro tip don't CSS that allows us to
use the micro tip library inside of our
project the next thing to do is to
create a button we then need to specify
an aria-label
and this will be my first tooltip with
the role of tooltip and once we save our
file we don't even have any text in the
button and we hover over the button you
can see my first tooltip it's simply as
easy as that so if we add some text such
as a tooltip one
we have the same result and I need to
zoom out a little bit design with five
hundred percent in there but as you can
see we do still have my first tool tip
so I bet you're wondering at this point
how do we change the position of our
tool tip well we can do that with
something known as the micro tip
position so if we were to add a data
attribute of micro tip - position and we
can first make this equal to up notice
how at this moment in time we don't have
any change
we can change this to be top and to make
this a little bit easier to see because
we do actually have a tool tip on top of
that bun let's add some styling so
inside of the head let's add a style
object now we can start off by giving
this a container class so let's make a
container class we use that to display
flags and will justify the content in
the center so if we then putz our button
inside of a container like so we're now
in the center but we're not in the
center of the screen and that's because
we need to have a line items equal the
center and the height are 100 view
height so here we are in the middle of
the screen you can now see that we have
my first tool tab on top of our button
this is awesome the way that we then
change this to other different sides of
the button is by using different
conditionals and these things can be
like top left as you see we now have a
tooltip on the top left we can do the
same for top right we have other
positions such as bottom that goes
underneath our tooltip we add bottom
right to that you could see that we then
have at the bottom right as you may
expect we also have a bottom left we
also have a standard just left on its
own and then we have a left tool
yep and a right tool tip but the next
thing I hear you saying okay we have
this button we've got this tool tip and
we can change the position what if I
have a massive piece of text and I want
to make my tool tip bigger
well you certainly can't do that and
that's with the micro tip size arrow
beat so let's also now add it data micro
tip size let's start off with small as
you can see small looks like that we
then have medium medium is certainly a
little bit larger we also have large
large is significantly larger and as you
could imagine if you had a lot of text
here you would then be able to display
this on screen and then we also have fit
so fit simply takes the width of the
tool tab to be the same of the width on
the element it only works when you use
top or bottom as well so do keep that in
mind when using this attribute we can
also change the way our tool tip locks
so it's based on CSS variables so for
example if we were to make here root we
could add the micro tab font size of 20
pixels and if we save this and refresh
our page you'll notice that our tool tip
size is significantly bigger if we added
200 pixels we'd certainly be able to see
that that does change we have different
things like the transition duration we
keep on that to be one second
now you see that when the tooltip
doesn't appear to actually appearing
that does take one second
it also takes one second to leave so any
sort of animation
will then be reflected we could do the
same for the micro tip transition delay
we could make that one second you see
the tilt it doesn't appear until one
second has passed we could also change
the weather the easing works using the
transition easing so if we used ease out
you'd see that the way our animation
actually appears does change you can
change things like the font where's so
in stand if we wanted this to be bald we
could like and we would have ball text
and finally we also have a micro tab
text transform and we could do anything
that you may expect here such as
uppercase
so our tooltip would then be entirely in
uppercase you want limited to setting
the configuration variables to the
document itself we could create a
particular class such as a tooltip or
button tooltip class and if we simply
just had upper case here and nothing
else and we removed the rest of the
configuration objects and we give our
button the class of button tooltip and
we refresh our page you'd see that our
tooltip is entirely uppercase so it's up
to you you can do on a root basis or a
specific case by case basis and you
should find that your tooltips are quite
customizable let me know what you think
of this library what other library do
