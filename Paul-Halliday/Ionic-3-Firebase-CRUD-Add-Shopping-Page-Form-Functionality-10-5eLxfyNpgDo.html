in new folder named models and in new
folder inside of the models folder named
a shopping - item inside of the shopping
- item folder we can make F file named
shopping - item dots interface dot TS
inside of this file we can define what a
shopping item looks like in this
instance it's quite simple because it
only has two fields so at this point in
time you may think it's not necessary
but as we start making more complex
applications it's always good to have a
model so let's export an interface named
shopping item we can first start with an
item name of type string and an item
number of type number number we've
created an interface we can head back to
our ad shopping dot CS inside of this
page we can initialize a new shopping
item by saying shopping item is equal to
a new javascript object and we're going
to tell typescript that actually we know
a little bit more about this javascript
object so we can say this is a new
object as and then we can cast this to a
shopping item so in order to use the
shopping item we can import that from
our models folder and then pass it to
our shopping items
interface
also have done that we can head over to
our own shopping dot html' and we can
add an NG model on our iron input which
allows us to capture the input from this
field and we can say that the first one
the item name is equal to shopping item
dot item mem and the second field can
have an NG model once again
but instead of the item mem we can use
item number this allows us to capture
the end parts of both the item name and
the item number therefore we can add a
click event to the bottom and that can
point at a function named ad shopping
item let's pass through the shopping
item as a parameter and inside of all
components I'm going to remove the own
viewdidload for now just to keep things
nice and clean in here we can write the
add a shopping item function
can say that this expects a shopping
item f-type shopping item
and all I want to do at this point in
time is simply log out the results by
saying console dot log shopping item so
in here what we're doing is creating a
new object inside of our view we're
using ng model to assign the value of
whatever the user puts in
internet shopping item object and then
for now all I want to do is log of the
results out to the console so let's
start off by right-clicking and hitting
inspect and if we never get to our
JavaScript console by hitting the
console and then inside of our ad
shopping page we can add something to
the item list for example pizza and we
want five pizzas if we click add item
you can see that we now get this object
here inside of the console that contains
the item name and the item number the
item number in this circumstance is
actually is string so when it comes to
adding it to 5s we'll look at how we can
cast that to a number so this point in
time we have the ability now to capture
an input from our form and we'll simply
log in out to the console let's now look
at how we can commit this data to our
firebase database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
