at some unit tests within our angular
applications so let's make in new
application for the purposes of this
demo by using ng mu and I'm going to
call my project to angular testing
when that has completed we can CD into
angular testing and right away if we
just run the tests that come along with
the angular CLI essentially what happens
is we get tests written with jasmine and
run with comma and we can do this by
saying ng test this will open up the
tests inside of the browser and you can
see right here that we have three test
specs for the app components and
essentially we have it should create the
app it should have the title up works
and the title should render inside of a
h1 tag we also get a depiction of the
app component and we can verify that yes
indeed it does have app works and it is
rendered inside of a h1 tag so let's
take a look at the testing spec inside
of our browser so head over to source up
and then up component spec PS if you've
never done any testing before this might
look a little scary we have things like
describe blocks before each and then
these assertion blocks with it should do
this and expect this at the moment that
we are just simply going to gloss over
this and make our first test of that
involves none of the angular stuff just
simply testing to see whether something
is true so we'll come back to that in a
moment
for now let's simply delete everything
inside of this file and start from
scratch
so beforehand we have something called a
describe book so we have this describe
here and what we need to put inside of
the describe is a description of the
suite of tests that we're going to
create sort think of this as the
overarching goal for your tests so at
the moment I'm going to say we're
testing the app components the second
parameter to our describe function is
the spec definitions and this is a
function so let's add a new function and
then inside the void describe block we
can declare a new test by using the it
keywords now it is just a function and
it has an expectation so at the moment
I'm going to say something that's not
related to the app component at all
and we're just going to say true should
be true because women test the assertion
that true is true we can now have an
assertion inside of our f-block and we
can expect that true is to be true and
essentially in this assertion we're
saying true should be true but before we
do that let's say that true should be
false now we obviously know that this is
not the case because if something is
true it's not false but by doing it this
way we can have a test but feels first
and we can then correct the test saw
that the test passes if we save the file
and take a look back inside of our
browser we now have the new spec that we
created now because we deleted all the
other specs we only have the true to be
true
so this spec right here which says true
it should be true has field and that's
because it expected true to be false if
we instead so that true should be true
we now get a passing test that says true
should be true so this right here is the
basis of our testing going forwards
we're simply going to have a describe
block which describes the suite which
we're testing we have eight blocks which
perform a description of the assertion
and then within those eight blocks we
make the assertion to see whether
something it should be the value that we
expect it to be now at different stages
of our testing lifecycle we also have
things like before each so this during
me before each stage would be setting up
the test to have particular states
beforehand we also have things like
after each to reset the state of stuff
that we do in slide bar tests but for
now let's simply make a new component
and investigate these concepts a little
bit further so let's generate a new
component named the counter component we
can do that by saying ng GC which is ng
generates component counter this will be
automatically added to our app module so
all we need to do then is head over to
the app components
and instead add our app counter to our
app components so before going any
further let's delete everything inside
of the describe blog within our counter
components Bank simply leave the imports
and this described concert component so
let's make a template for our counter
components and that will simply be a
paragraph tag the word number as well as
a colon and then we'll have the current
number of the counter we'll also have
two buttons so button one will say
increments and bantoom we'll set
decrement both of them will have a click
event named increment and the second one
will also have a click event named
decrement if we then implement these
functions by saying we will have a
counter and that will be of type number
the initial value for the council will
be one inside of our increment function
we can simply increment the counter by
one and for our decrements we'll simply
- the concert by one so we have a very
simple component that displays the
counter number and we also increment it
by 1 or decrement the dependant on
whether we click the button so to check
everything works before going forward
laps around ng serve and check it out
inside of the browser as you can see
right here we have a counter with a
number of 1 if we click that we get 2
and if we decrement the counter we get 1
this can be done as many times as us
sure we could continuously increment or
continuously decrements let's now write
some tests for our counter components so
inside of our counter component spec we
can start off by firstly removing
everything inside of the describe block
apart from our component and fixture
inside of our describe block we have our
reference to the counter component and
then we have something called a fixture
so a component fixture is essentially a
reference to our Kanpur
with a few other methods added on these
are things like detector changes which
allow us to perform change detection
from within our tests we can also access
things like the net of elements the
component instance and a few other
things that we'll take a look at in a
second
so the first thing that we have to do is
declare one of the before each books
that we were talking about earlier on
inside be before each we'll be declaring
a new testing module and we'll be
importing our counter component into the
testing module so let's write before
each and then inside of the before each
we need to perform an async action so
that's right s Inc and inside of this
function we can simply say a testbed
which is the testbed that we've imported
from angular core testing and this
provides us with different things such
as a new module which will create in a
second don't configure testing module
and this module is created just at the
same as any other module would be so we
can have air declarations and inside of
the declarations we can add our counter
component and the reason we have to call
this with air sink is because we then
need to call compiled components and
what this does is it waves for our
asynchronous templates to be lauded such
as our counter component or HTML I will
count the component of CSS and so on we
can then have another before each block
and in this before each block will do
things like setting up our components so
so far we've simply said that we have
two variables here one named component
and the other one called fixture now at
the moment we've yet to initialize them
we've simply said they are either type
of counter components or type of
component fixture so let's now see a
fixture is equal to test beds dots
create components inside of the create
component methods we can pass our
counter component this gives us a
testing version of our counter
components we can then get an instance
of that testing component by saying
components is equal to fixture dot
components instance you'll notice that
already with its ID components and then
on our component we have access to
things like the counter property
the increment function and the decrement
function will not need to use them yet
but we will look very soon so the first
two tests that I'm going to write here
is to assert that the counter component
simply states the current number of the
counter so we can say it and then our
expectation should be written in English
so it should display the current number
of the counter after our expectation
we're going to have an assertion
function and in here we need to assert
that the text on-screen is equal to a
particular value so how might we do that
let's say now add a comment asserts that
the text on screen is of number 1
so to get reference to that we'll have
to create some more variables
the first thing we have to do is get
access to the debug element and that
debug element comes from angular core so
let's imports from at angular slash core
the debug elements and we can say let's
debug elements is of type debug elements
and when we use the debug element to get
a reference of what will be the
paragraph tag that says number one we
want to get the need of hedge tml
element within of that element itself
this will become apparent very soon but
for now let's them can make a new
variable named HTML element of type HTML
element and the final thing that we need
to import is something called by and by
importing by it allows us to query on a
particular element for example if we
import from arts angular slash platform
- browser we can import by and because
we may be checking the current number on
a few occasions I'm going to put this
and me before each so we'll start off by
saying that the debug elements is equal
to the component thinks jar dots debug
elements and then we can query the
elements within the components DOM and
say bye so we clear in by and we'll say
everything that matches the CSS and
within the CSS selector I'm going to say
P for paragraph and if we take a look
inside of our components at the moment
we have the one paragraph tag and that
paragraph tag simply says number and
inside of that number is a counter so
the counter is going to be the value
after or before it has been incremented
or decremented so now we've got access
to that debug element let's get the
native HTML element for that query so we
can say HTML elements is equal to P
debug elements dot native element
we now have a hold of that queried HTML
elements because of that we can now
assert that the text on screen is of
number one and that's because that's the
default number for our counter so we can
say expect that the HTML elements and
the text content of that elements is
equal to number one but to make this
fail first so we can check that our test
is actually doing what we expected to
I'm going to say number two notice now
how we do gaps that are a first but
there's something a little bit off with
the error message it's seeing expected
number and then we don't actually have a
number here to equal number two and this
is because we currently don't have any
change detection implemented within our
test we can handle change detection
within angular in a couple of ways we
can leave up to angular to do
automatically or alternatively we can do
it ourselves by leaving up to angular
anything that is synchronous is caught
by the change detection anything that's
a synchronous change it to the value is
not let's take a look at how we can use
change detection within our tests so
when we initialize our component let
Spencer fixture don't detect changes if
we read the description it does say
trigger a change detection cycle for the
component and if we love get inside of
all components when we are initializing
the components we also in the counter as
equal to one so when we don't actually
call that change detection that counter
has not been initialized to 1 if we save
our file and lock back inside of our
browser we now get the error expected
number one to equal number two we can
now see that our assertion is working
correctly we've expected number one to
equal number two so let's say number one
we can now see that all of our tests
currently pass we are displaying the
current number of the counter and we
have number one here let's now make a
new test
and that tester should increment the
counter number by one so let's say it
should increment that counter number by
one can make an assertion function and
the first thing that I'll do is I will
arrange my test and I will get the
current value of the components counter
number so we can say initial value is
equal to the component counter and as we
know that's currently equal to one let's
now act on our test and we can of course
call the component dot increments and
that's going to increment the number of
the counter by one we can then capture
the new value by saying the new value is
equal to the components counter and then
our assertion here would simply be that
the new value is greater than the
initial value but let's make it feel
fast by saying the initial value should
be greater than the new value and yet
again we get the expected one to be
greater than two which we expected and
if we put that back
so we now have expect the new value to
be greater than the initial value we now
get our passing test of the number of
being - however on the screen our change
detection doesn't seem to have kicked in
so let's make sure that our tests are of
course detecting any changes after we
increment the value within the component
if we then click the counter component
to answer it should increment the
counter by one we click on we have the
number is equal to two but if we remove
the detect changes and click the
increment come to number by one again we
don't have our number equaling to two on
screen so it's a good idea to implement
detector changes whenever you're making
any changes within at your tests I'm
going to clean this up a little bit so
we can see the screen and then I'm going
to copy this and instead we will say it
should decrement the counter number by
one so we can say components decrement
and if we save the file on Rises we have
our initial failure expected zero to be
greater than one and now we can say that
the immune value should of course would
be less than at the initial value and
once we do that we do see that the
decrement does work seem to have lost my
detect changes so let's detect the
changes once again and instead when we
click it we do see that our number is
zero so hopefully you're seeing right
now but initially we have some
boilerplate to deal with such as before
h and importing all of our dependencies
but when we actually get interrupt it's
quite simple to test our components now
right now we have a simple example of a
counter but in future videos within the
series we'll take a look at making
things a little more complex looking at
services and so on
finally I want to write two more tests
and these tests are going to be after
the number is incremented is the correct
number shown on screen and after the
number is decremented is the correct
number Shaun so this one is quite simple
we can say that this test should display
the counter number on screen after being
incremented by one to keep this video a
short I'll simply say that we will first
off say components the increment will
then a capture any changes I think
fixture dots detect changes and
obviously I'm aware that at the moment
it will pass if this is number two but
if this number was to become three our
current assertion here which would be
shunt display the counter number on
screen after being incremented by one
would not technically be correct because
once that becomes three it no longer
equals number two so this is an
important point that when you're
actually testing at your components and
you're designing tests it's important to
make sure that the test actually
accurately represents what is happening
but to keep this video short let's just
a test for that we can also test for the
fact that the number will be decremented
by one so the number should equal number
zero and can say component decrement if
we then run this in the browser we do
get indeed it's six passing tests but if
we were then to say components two
increments and instead we call that
twice our tester now fails so it's
important like I said to be quite
specific on the functionality that you
are testing I hope that this video has
proven a good introduction to testing
