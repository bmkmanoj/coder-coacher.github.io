open CV series so what we're going to do
here is now take the image make that
image grayscale and then save the image
to F file so we're going to pass a flag
to our image and I'm going to rename
this to greyscale underscore image and
the flags that we're going to pass is
going to be CB 2 dot I am Reed
underscore grayscale and we're going to
say read image as grayscale so now we
can show the greyscale image we can
change the title to be poor grayscale
and if we run this once again we can now
see that our image is grayscale the
final thing that we need to do is after
showing the image we want to save that
for the files or save to file and we can
say CB 2 dot am right and we can pass in
at the file mem so say it's at the image
path poor underscore grayscale PNG and
the file that we want to write for
example the image we want to write is
that grayscale underscore image so if we
run this once again we get our grayscale
image and then we get this Paul
underscore grayscale PNG inside of our
image folder if we open it you can see
that we have our grayscale image so that
wraps up how we can save an image with
OpenCV and python as well as how we can
make our image grayscale don't forget to
hit that subscribe button to stay
updated and I'll see you soon in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
