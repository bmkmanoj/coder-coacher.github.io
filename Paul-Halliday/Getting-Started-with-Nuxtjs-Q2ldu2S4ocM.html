we're going to start looking at view and
next so Knox da GS is a framework for
creating Universal view dot GS
applications so we have a very
lightweight framework we have
server-side rendering and much more so
to get started and show you've installed
the view CLI and you can do that by
seeing NPM install view - Co I - it G
once I've done that you can head to the
directory that you want to start your
project in so mine will be hello - Knox
and then from within this directory we
can save you in it and the template that
we want to use is next slash starter and
if we just hit enter will be given at
the wizard so yet we do want to create
the project in this directory I'm happy
to leave the project name as is as well
as the description author
and now that that's done we need to run
NPM install NPM install will of course
install all of our dependencies for our
project and as always when installing
dependencies it may take a little bit of
time and now that we have all of our
dependencies we can run NPM run dev and
this will run the dev script which will
start our application and listen on
localhost 3000 so when we navigate to
local horse to 3,000 we are greeted with
this animation if we open up our project
inside of our editor we should of course
the over see how this all ties together
as you can see here we're starting off
with this index top view if we simply
remove everything and create a new
templates that simply says h1 hell or
world you can see that everything is
disappeared and now we simply have this
hello world on screen so one of the
awesome things about Knox is that it
transforms every view file inside of the
pages directory to actually be a route
for the application so if we had another
page for example if we had a boat dot
view and we made ourselves a template
and we'll give ourselves a h1 with a
bolt and now we navigated to slash about
you can see that already we've created
ourself a route and that route has an
Associated templates with a h1 saying
about so already you should be seen just
how powerful mak'st is when all we need
to do to create a new route is simply by
making in new file inside of that pages
directory let's now take a look at the
directory structure inside of our app
now we can start off with the assets
folder so as you can see this contains
our uncompelled assets such as any less
sass or JavaScript
we also have a components folder now the
components folder is any UGS components
as you can see we have that basic logo
components after which we have our
layouts folder and this contains any
default layouts so you can see that
right now we have this next component
and if we remove that for example and
instead just put something static like a
paragraph of hello you'd see that no
matter what route we go to whether it's
the about route or the index row we get
hello
so a good idea at this point is if you
wanted to add basically a static
navigation bar you could do so and if
you pretended that this was in navbar at
this point and if we changed the route
you can see that we now have bar would
be on both pages but the contents for
each one of our routes would change but
we could also create some custom routes
and inside of our odds we can define a
script tag that uses a different layout
so it could select a different layout
should we wish for example if we just
call this different view inside of this
layouts folder here and instead we just
make it template that just literally has
the word different inside of a div and
we can set perhaps our index to use the
difference as a layout and you'll notice
that if we do go to that root page we do
get different but if we go back to about
you'll see that it obviously does use
the default layout because we're not
specifying a different layout for this
page so layouts are really powerful in
Next and I recommend that you take
advantage of them in as many ways as
possible
so it'd be next the folder is middleware
and as you can see middleware allows us
to define customer functionality to be
run before rendering a page or a group
of pages so it's often good to do any
sort of authentication checks as
middleware so that would definitely be
good place to do that and of course
we've looked at the next folder which is
pages and each view file that we created
actors of route so if we make a page for
example called a bulk view we can then
use the slash about route inside of our
application
the plugins folder contains any plugins
that you may want to run before
obviously instantiating the root view GS
application inside of our static folder
is everything that you'd expect it's
simply for static assets so at this
moment time we have our little v icon
inside of our store folder of everything
to do with step management and that is
simply done with view X we'll be
investigating view X in the future and
of course the rest of our files such as
our package JSON which contains our
dependencies and build scripts and the
next config yes is obviously a
configuration file for next so this has
been a hello world introduction to next
in this video we achieved the use of
routes by making new pages as well as
also investigating different layouts so
for example we give our indexed of view
it differently out literally named
different and of course our about page
did not have that so it had the default
layout as well as that we've
investigated all the different folders
inside of a knucks project so I'd love
to know what your thoughts are have you
used MUX before do you use it right now
if you do get in touch with me in the
comments I'd love to know what you think
and if you don't what you'd like to see
more view content let me know and of
course I can start adding that into the
content and I'm creating right now don't
forget to hit that subscribe button
check out learner Nick 3 from scratch if
you haven't already
Paul holiday door I always wear you can
get that and of course we do have some
discounted bundles for this week only
every one of my courses are the moments
in the same bundle for 22 pounds that's
quite a discount if you consider all the
hours that have gone into that and also
the current hours that I've been added
for that we do actually have a new
course coming out very soon and a whole
section being added to that that's to do
with fibers and we've got things like
create retrieve update delete but I
don't want to quote this video up
anymore so until next time I'll see you
very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
