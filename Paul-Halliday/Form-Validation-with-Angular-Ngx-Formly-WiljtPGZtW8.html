form validation is really important in
angular we can do this in a few ways but
one of the ways we're going to look at
today is going to be using the ng X form
Lee library
this integrates tightly with angular
material and also bootstrap we will be
using material for this example and as
you can see right now on screen I'm
simply just creating a new project with
the angular CLI and that's done by
saying ng mu and then of course the name
of your project once there has completed
we can see D into ng form Li validation
or whatever you called your project will
need entry that we have the angular
forms package installed as well as at ng
X - a form Lee slash core and if you
haven't got the latest version of NPM
you will of course need to add - - a
save to the end of that so that gives us
everything we need as far as using the
core version of form Lee but we can also
use a particular UI and this gives us
just tight integration with things like
angular material so let's install the at
ng X - formerly slash material package
that's everything we need for form Lee
the next thing we need is to install
angular material itself and that's done
by installing the angular slash material
package and also the angular component
development kit so that's angular / CD
care step 2 of the material installation
is also installing the angular
animations package this allows us to of
course these animations throughout our
project
and as far as i installing dependencies
that should be everything that we need
so I'm going to run up V escort and also
at the same time execute ng serve so
here we have our standard angular
application on the right and of course
our project here on the left let's
ensure that we have a material setup
before we go any further so this means
we can head over to our module don TS
and start importing the necessary
modules so the first thing we really
need is to import from the platform
browser slash animations and we want the
browser animations module so let's add
that to the list of imports next up I
want to import the reactive forms module
from angular forms so let's do that add
that to our imports and finally then we
also need the @ng X - a form Lee slash
core and that'll be the form Lee module
and we need the form Lee slash material
and that will be the formally material
module so we have quite a few imports to
start with but once we get this up and
running everything shall be good so we
need to add the form Lee module to our
imports and because this is the root
module we need to put dot for route if
we are using a feature module with
formally we'll have to use dot for child
so you will have to keep that in mind
finally let's add the form Lee material
module so that's our app module sub we
now want to go over to styles.css and
what that allows us to do is import an
appropriate material theme I want to
import from the angular material package
the pre-built themes
and the theme I want to use is the
Indigo - pink CSS at the same time I'll
also puts a blank margin and padding
rule to our body one that allows us to
do is just sort of reset our sort of
view a little bit so if we head over to
our app component or HTML we can then
add it Matt - toolbar and the toolbar
itself will have a span inside which
will say angular form Lee now this won't
work because it won't recognize the Matt
toolbar so we need to go back to our app
module dot es and we want to import the
Matt toolbar module that comes from the
angular slash material package and
you'll notice that when we do save our
file we of course get our toolbar here
on-screen we can give this a color of
primary and then we'll have a blue
toolbar and it's what we expect from of
course a material design application
next up let's head over to the app
component ES and I want to create a
contact form so it contacted this a
moment in time will be a person that has
a name a phone number and an email
address the form itself can be
referenced as a form group
so let's import that from angular slash
forms we also need to provide a model
for our form so let's head over to our
project we can make a new folder called
models and then a new file called
contact Model Ts we can export a class
called contact and that contact will
have a name a phone number and an email
inside of our art component we can then
give the contact model the type of our
contact model that we just exported the
next thing to do is to sort of generate
some fields for our form this could be
done with a contact fields and there
should be in a rare of formely field
config
if we look at the formerly filled config
interface you can see we have things
like key ID name and a variety of other
options these are things that we'll be
looking out very soon but for now will
simply initialize all of these things
inside of our constructor we can set up
the contact form and of course make a
new contact but at this stage in the
process we also need to start thinking
about the form fields that we want on
the screen let's make our contact fields
equal to a new array that contains one
object with the key of name the type of
inputs and we'll also add a template
options object this will give us a type
of text we can also add a label at the
same time as well as a placeholder
finally we can say that this is required
so if we think about this as maybe an
input field you could see that it would
have the type of text it would have a
label above it and perhaps this would be
inside of a div that label would say
name we would have a placeholder on the
input object itself it would be required
and so on so basically what we're doing
is we're sort of describing how our
forms should like and we're living up to
formally to sort this out so the next
thing to do of course is to head back
over our up component or HTML and inside
of here
we'll make a new form the form will have
the form group of the contact form
inside of which will have the form lis
form that will have the model of our
contact model it will have the fields of
the contact fields and the form
reference will of course be that contact
form once again let's save the file
on screen you can now see that we do
have this form and already you can see
just how easy this is to of course
expand on this form so if we had our
contact model and inside of here we can
make a form fields function this would
return in a rare which would be the form
field config
don't forget to import that from of
course ngx form leak or
and we can take our previous element and
we can add other elements such as the
phone number and of course the email so
for the second one maybe you would have
a phone number the type of which could
be tell the label could be for the
number the same goes for the placeholder
and we can finally repeat this once more
for the email then back inside of our
app component instead of assessing if
this sort of empty object at this moment
we can say that we want to set the
fields equal to our contact don't form
fields so there's now against the fields
from the model we do have a slight error
we have to go back to our contact model
and add that this will be an array not
simply just an object but as you can see
on screen we then get those are three
form fields all of which are reflectance
of what we wanted but if I put something
in here and maybe I go off or what I'd
like to have some form of error message
how do we do that well we can head back
over to our contact model and we can set
the validation object to give out
messages based on a variety of different
things
so we can save required and the error
message should be you need to provide a
name and we can simply copy this across
to the other elements
and if we save the file and then select
a form item you'll see that we then get
this or a message so I guess the final
thing to do at this moment in time is to
head back to our art component and
inside of the formerly form we can add a
button that button will be disabled only
when the contact form is invalid
otherwise the bun will have the type of
submit and it will be a material raised
button we'll give it the text of the
submit form and finally we'll need to
add an ng submit to the form itself this
will fire a function whenever we hit
that button so let's make a function
called subnet form it will take in the
contact model and all that we'll do at
this moment is simply log the contact
model to the console in order to give
the button material styling we can head
back over to our Aunt module and import
the Matt button module and add it to the
list of imports if we then put something
in the name field the phone number field
and the email field
not a sound we can then type inside of
the box and hit submit when we do that
we get that contact object which
contents the email the name and the
phone number at the same time we could
also make another div we'll give this
the class of chords while at h1 which
describes our model and then we'll
simply look at what the model looks like
as we're typing into the fields as well
as that we can also check to see whether
the form is valid and with a tiny bit of
styling maybe something like a
background color some font color
it's tiny bit of margin and padding we
can see that at the moment the form is
not valid we have an empty content
object but as I type the form does
become valid and of course it fills up
our model so that's how we use the ngx
formely module along with a material
design inside of our angular
applications
