look at fee record in monospaced fonts
that contains every riot e of
programming ligatures so before we get
into that let's quickly show how we can
get this on our machine and what we need
to do is head over to github and I'll
put a link inside of the description so
you don't have to worry about that and
you can click downloads
once you click download you'll be able
to access the TrueType font files and
what we need to do on a Mac is simply
open up this file and install the inside
of your fonts folder on Windows you may
be able do the same or drag it inside of
your font folder and then you should
build the access inside of your IDE as
always we'll be using Visual Studio code
and I'll show you how we can get that
set up inside of our settings that
simply put your font family to beefy
records and also enable font ligatures
so are the font ligatures equal to true
so let's take like an hour font then so
as you can see it's very readable font
each character is both aesthetic and
also has appropriate space in between
it's a monospaced font and we also have
things like custom ligatures so let me
show you the power of that if we wanted
to make a couple of variables so let's
say Const dog equals dog and Const cart
equals cat and if we wanted to say that
F dog does not equal cat console the log
do something so as you can see when
we've said is not equal to we are
instead of getting in exclamation mark
and equal sign it's joined it together
to make this not equal sign so overall
in my opinion Utz is significantly more
readable than seeing those two
characters together seeing them as one
certainly makes it more readable for me
I like it it's more concise and if we
wanted to do the same but instead equal
to you'll notice if we put two equal
signs it joins it together as one
character and for three equal signs it
makes it larger and joins about one
together as well
so while we're having these custom
ligatures inside of our cord it just
makes things more readable for us and we
have to do less work to understand what
our cord is actually doing at least in
my opinion I do think it's much better
and it does make the cord much more
readable so if we did the same but now
we did an arrow you can see that it
joins the arrow together the same sense
cause for if we made a double arrow it
makes it more static this really comes
into play when we start writing comments
so as you can see here we have this as a
comment and usually we would have in our
order luck like that or a different are
all that locked it like that and it's
just much more readable because what
happens it becomes this one character
that easily joins together if for
example we remove a piece and it just
makes our cord that much more readable
and more aesthetic so I'm a big fan of
this inside of this font I do like it
very much you'll notice that when we are
writing hashtags as well so if we made a
markdown file for example home to MD and
we wanted to make for example it title
maybe something like hello world but
when we add an extra hash you can see
that it sort of joins the hashes
together into a more readable font
the same goes for other content like for
example if we're writing a web address
and we had WWE if you can order c1 we
get my third W in it sort of joins all
the characters together to sure that
this is a worldwide web font ligature so
overall I'm a big fan of this font I do
think it's easy to read our cords it
offers a variety of benefits with the
fonts ligatures and I would definitely
recommend this if you're looking for a
new programming font what fun do you use
do you want me to review any other fonts
I would love to see what you use inside
of your IDE let me know inside of the

until next time I'll see you very soon
