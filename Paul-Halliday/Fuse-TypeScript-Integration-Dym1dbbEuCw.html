applications so we can run npm install
typescript - g and if you've not heard
of typescript before it's essentially a
superset of JavaScript and trans pales
down to JavaScript one rewriter it
allows us to use things like es6 es 7
and so on as well as statically typing
our variables of course it offers we're
more functionality than that but at the
high level that's all we need to know
outside of that we can run npm install
pipings - gee if we want to install any
specific typescript typing's we can then
make a new fuse project and I'm going to
say fuse create up and the app I'm going
to create is typescript fuse that has
been created and we can now CD into
typescript fuse I'm going to clean my
console and open this up inside of
Visual Studio chords so as always we
have a standard fuse project with their
main view and a typescript fuse dot uno
project if we then run TSC - - in it
from our command line we should of
course get a new typescript config don't
JSON generated within our project if we
take a look at this in more detail we
can see that we have some base compiler
options here and these are a variety of
settings that we can set within our
typescript configuration you can see
that we're targeting es 5 so no matter
what we write it will be transpiled down
to es 5 we're using common jeff's as a
default but you can select other things
like System GS and more as well as that
we have strict modes and a variety of
other things but the thing that we want
to look at right now is the root
directory and the output directory so
I'm going to uncomment output directory
and within here this is the folder where
all of the transpile javascript is
placed so I'm going to add this to a
folder called generators now for the
core builders used by few so if we've
said built or build we might get
confused with that so I'm going to put
generated for now and the root directory
specifies the root directory of the
input files so this is where our
JavaScript is located so I'm going to
specify the root directory should be a
full bar
named source so we then have to create F
folder named source and inside of the
source folder we might have things like
an app we may have other pages like
settings and so on but for now we'll
just simply make an app file and then we
can put up tort es inside of the app
folder if we had a class such as AB and
the class had a title of type string
equal to F use typescript we then it be
able to export a member of this class
and would be able to access that inside
of our UX so let's make a new art
variable constant up is in new up and we
can export the title by saying export
Const title is equal to the app title
this is the same as exporting it member
from air module so now what we have to
do is tell fuse about this new generate
this folder and B files within up before
getting to that let's generate the
transpile the JavaScript from typescript
and we can do that by saying PSC - -
watch this trans files the typescript
down to JavaScript and we'll watch for
any more file changes you can now see we
have this generated folder and inside of
the generated folder is a mirror of our
source folder but instead of typescript
it's JavaScript so if we click apt or GS
we can now see the results and the key
factor here is this export store title
is equal to AB dot title this is what we
dry if we did it in standard es 5 so if
you have not used typescript before you
can see the generated result the next
thing to do is tell fuse about this
generated folder so inside of typescript
fusion or project we can say that we
want to include everything inside of
slash generators slash anything slash
anything GS and we can add that to our
bundle so I'd be cool on a bundle this
means when we build our project fees is
going to look for anything inside of the
generated folder and of course class bat
as project codes so so far in our very
small example we're taking the title of
our application and
sporting it inside of our module then
inside of our main view UX we could do
something like Xavier panel perhaps
align the panel and the center of the
screen and we can have a textview
with the value over that title so how do
we get access to the title inside of our
main view don't you eggs scorp well
that's quite easy I have shown you in
past but we can actually just add
JavaScript to this javascript block here
but we can also if we wanted to add that
external file so we get tell fuse but
actually we have a JavaScript file and
that's been generated slash up slash out
go Jess and now the scope of our men
view UX will of course be in the app
door Jess we're exporting a title so if
we've done everything correct we should
see that title in the middle of the
screen lets it run this and we can run a
whole project by saying fuse preview
this is going to start the build process
and we should see the application on
screen and there we have it we have fuse
typescript 2 in the middle of the screen
that's been transpired down from our
typescript to JavaScript and then of
course we're displaying the results of
that on screen if we made a quick change
to this and said fuse is awesome we get
instantly updated on screen and that's
one of the awesome things about fuse is
that if we make any changes for updated
instantly so if you're thinking about
using typescript inside of your fuse
projects this is how you can get set up
in doing that people asking for more
fuse videos we're starting out with the
basics covering a few little concepts
for start getting more complex as time
goes by if you like this one obviously
