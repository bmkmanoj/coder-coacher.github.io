and the action sheet inside of the quiz
our framework so this allows you to add
an action sheet to your view GS quiz are
apps and if you haven't done already
installed the quiz I'll see you live by
seeing NPM install quiz R - Eli - G
after that I've gone ahead to insert
quiz' and net to action sheets and that
starts a new project in which you can
then run npm install that will install
your dependencies and you'll be in the
same position as me so if we open this
up inside of our editor we have a list
of components and i'm going to be simply
going to index top view and inside of
index top view i'm going to get rid of
everything in this layout view here just
so we start off with this or blanket
component and for now I'm also going to
delete everything inside of our script
and style block
so we should be left with a simple
template and allow view let me change
the title of this to be action sheet
just so everything works a little
cleaner awesome if we now run our
project inside of the browser by seeing
quasar Dev they should start a
development server and as we can see we
do have that tool bar and the tool bar
title is named action sheet so all goods
are so far the next thing to do is of
course add a button and that button I'm
simply going to give the class of
primary with the text of open action
sheet let's also give this button a
click event of open action sheet and we
can go ahead and write that inside of
our script block so to use action sheet
we fast as the importer from quasar so
when we have a reference to that we can
define in new methods and that method is
going to be called the open action sheet
and from here we can say action sheet
dot create so the create methods allows
us to specify things like it title
particular actions whether we want to
allow the user to dismiss the action
sheet and so on so let's start off with
a title which would be my first action
sheet
have some actions this is
and rare of actions so the first action
could have a level of share for example
and an icon of share and a click handler
so that if somebody clicks on this
simply share
let's do the same but now we can do the
should be delete and the icon should be
delete and we can simply log out delete
to the console so so far if we click our
button let's have a load by clicking
open action sheet you can see that we
get this action sheet at the bottom and
we obviously have share and delete
because that's all we've specified
inside of our actions
if we take a look at this as in mobile
device and then we click open action
sheet once again and then click share
you can see that we get share log down
to the console and delete log down to
the console we can also change this into
gallery mode so if we say gallery is
equal to true inside of our action sheet
we get sort of different example this
may be good if you have a lot of items
or you want to prioritize the icons
let's take that off for now and we can
also add a dismiss button so let's add a
dismiss well add a level of cancel an
icon of cancel and we can also add
different classes let's add the text
primary class and once again we can add
air handler so we can say console.log
cancel now if we go ahead and select
open action sheet you'll see that we
have this cancel if we're to click the
cancel you can see that we do get it
logged out to the console so it's a
similar button like the others and if we
do add our gallery back the cancel
doesn't change so what we have is this
come forward the bottom all the time but
we have the gallery styled icons when
what on a browser we can also hit the
Escape key to close the action sheet
another thing we can do is instead of
using an icon we can actually use an
avatar so we can send Avatar to be for
example assets pH JPEG now we'll remove
the icon for now I'll simply comment it
out and if I click open action sheet
another thing we can do is instead of
using an icon we can also use something
called an avatar so let's add an avatar
instead of the icon within particular
URL
so if we then have a look at our auction
sheet and we select open action sheet
you can see that now we have this avatar
instead of the icon if we remove gallery
from being true
and we go back and select our action
sheet again you can see our avatar here
in the list so that about wraps up
everything to do with action sheets
inside of the quiz our view framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
