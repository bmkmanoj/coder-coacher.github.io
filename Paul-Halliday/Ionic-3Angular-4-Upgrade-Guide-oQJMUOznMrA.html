already ionic 3 has recently been
released now in this video I'm going to
show you how to upgrade and don't worry
it's super easy all you have to do is
change a few settings so inside your
package JSON simply take your dev
dependencies and dependencies and update
them to the values on-screen I'll put
this in the description so you don't
have to worry about copying it right now
but essentially we need to make sure our
angular as at version full ionic is at
version 3 and all the other dependencies
match up to when you've done that we can
go into our finder and we can delete the
Nord modules folder now it's really
important that you don't overwrite any
dependencies or dev dependencies that
you already might have on the project as
when we come to install them again you
won't actually get them if they're not
listed inside of your dependencies here
so update everything that's already
there and keep things that aren't listed
in the description once you've done that
inside of your CMD you can run NPM
install this will upgrade everything to
the latest version when that's finished
we can run the ionic info make sure
you're in the project directory and I'll
tell you the version of ionic framework
and that's inside that directory so we
can see we're now on ionic 3.0 the final
thing that we have to do relates to
changes with angular 4 so inside of our
source app and app module we have to
import something called the browser
module so we can import the browser
module from angular platform a browser
we then need to add it inside of our
imports so a browser module like that so
this works a similar way for example if
you wanted to import the HTTP module to
use HTTP within your angular apps
you'd import it like that and then add
it to your imports if we run this on the
device or we run ionic serve we should
find that our application works just as
before but now we're using ionic 3
instead of ionic 2 3 0 there we are no
console errors or so that's all goods
there are a couple of breaking changes
with ionic 3 first off with the grids
the old grid is now deprecated and the
new grid is now in use you can find how
to use this in the description but I'm
going to have some videos up very soon
so check out the videos when they arrive
the second relates to the color
selectors within text elements so if you
put a color selector for example color
equals primary maybe on H 1 2 or 3 your
mouth after add to the ion - text
attributes else it won't work these been
deprecated since our C 3 so I imagine
you'll have had the console or if you've
been trying to use these for a while but
it's definitely something to keep in
mind if you find out that that's not
working when you upgrade to ionic 3
ionic slides has also had in numerous
amount of changes properties and methods
have been renamed and you can find the
information about this in the
description
until next time my name is Paul holiday
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
