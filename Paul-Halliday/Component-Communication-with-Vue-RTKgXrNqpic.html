how we can use properties inside of our
view components so essentially this is
component communication how we can
communicate from component air - of
course component B let's start off with
a blank vgs application and our first
exercise is to simply just get something
on-screen so we'll say hello name and of
course at this moment in time it's
simply just going to say hello because
we haven't defined a name variable so
inside of our objects on our view
instance we will simply return a new
object with the value of name equal to
pool now of course we get hello pool now
this is all well and good but what if we
wanted to have a particular component in
place of this h1 well this would be
known as our greeter component so let's
make a greater don't view and of course
it will scaffold out a new template and
that template will simply have a hitch
one and then instead will say hello name
we can register this component
throughout the application by heading
over to min GS so import greater from
greeter don't view we can then save the
u-dub component and we'll call us up
Drita and we'll pass through the greeter
component then inside of our div we can
of course add the app greeter and once
again we get hello but now we need to
add the data object back on to the other
component and now effectively we have
exactly what we had before
but this time I want to have an input
box and an input box will allow us to
type something inside of that and then
our greeter component I want to pass
that into my component and it should say
hello whatever we've typed in the box so
let's make ourselves an input with the
type of text and we'll add something
called v-model
now if you've used angular before you'll
see that v-model is quite similar to ng
model simply just allows us to have
two-way data-binding based on a property
and this property will of course be
called an M let's initialize a dead
object again this time with nem just
being blank and at this point we can
head back over to our greeter components
but instead of using data we're instead
going to use something called props now
props allows us to define a prop a
property on the component such as name
at this point so let's put a name as a
string and then on the component
instance we can say V - bind call on
name equal to name so what this is going
to do it's gonna bind that name property
equal to the name variable inside of our
app don't view so anything we type in
this box such as hello world that's good
we've communicated from this component
to another component and we can even
make this shorter if we get rid of the V
bind and simply just keep this as a
colon but what if I want to communicate
from the app greeter component back to
of course the app component how do we do
that well let's head back over to greet
a top view and we'll assign air methods
object let's make a method which is
called alert name and this will use this
don't don't omit and what dollar omit
does is allows us to pass an event we
pass an event by a string name and then
of course we listen to that event on our
parents components so let's call this
event the alert name the alert name at
this point has no relation to our
function so we could call us anything
and at this point we also want to pass
through this don't name this then passes
the value of the name of that has being
passed into this component so that when
we create a button with the click event
of alert name all we then need to do
of course head back to our app top view
and on the Aunt guita instance if we
type at alert NIM
effectively listening to this event so
we can make another method and this
method can be called whatever we want
but I'm simply going to call it the same
thing and at this point we'll use alert
so this is the window alert and we'll
alert that name and that comes through
as a parameter because we assign the
function call to be alert name and pass
through the event so I appreciate that
there is quite a few alert names
happening at this point but just
realised that we could simply call us
whatever we wanted to it has no relation
to the other alert name now if I type in
the box again and hit alert notice how
we get this alert at the top of the
screen and that's because what exactly
has happened as we've clicked the button
inside of the accretor component which
then of course emits this alert named
event it passes through this name as
it's off parameter argument to the
emitted event within lessoning if all
that events honored the component itself
by using at alert name and this would be
substituted for any sort of alert that
you're listening to so the name of the
alert on the right hand side here were
firing a function that happens to have
the same name as the alert but is not
necessary and of course in order to
access the name we need to use the
dollar event the event can be anything
you want it just so happens that it's
all bundled inside of this variable but
what if it we have decided that the type
of property has to be in number well we
need to change the way that we have our
props instead we need to make it into an
object then instead of name being a
string it also becomes an object with a
type of number we place this inside of
an array because it could be multiple
types if we wanted to it could also be
its own type if we've created our own
class so instantly you'll notice that if
we check our console we now get an error
because the name is
a string but it was expecting and number
so we could change that to instead of be
0 and this would of course stop our
error because it's no longer a string
but the second we then type inside of
the box we get that error Bank because
anytime we're typing inside of an input
box it is of course a string another
thing we can do is add required equal to
true or false that essentially states
that this property is required whenever
we create the component I'm going to put
the type back to being a string for now
we could also pass through a default if
we wanted a default value for the
property itself but more importantly we
can have something called a valid it up
the validator gives us the particular
value and we can determine whether this
is Ballads if for example the value dot
length is greater than 10 so let's have
like notice how it expected string but
got number that's fine we can simply get
rid of that and any time but we type we
get this error and that's because the
custom validator has said hey this is
literally one character I'm expecting at
least 10 for this to be valid so if we
type 10 characters notice how we only
have 10 are messages inside of the
console and that's because after the 10
items after the 10 characters inside of
the string it is of course a valid
property so as far as the basics of
component communication inside of view
