Amazon Alexa introduction video today
we're going to create our very first
Amazon Alexa application it's super
simple Alexa is going to be saying some
predetermined phrases or sort of easy to
get into if you don't know anything
about the Alexa SDK we're going to be
creating something called the confidence
builder perhaps you've had too much
cheesecake yesterday but Alexa is always
there to tell you how awesome you look
so the first thing we have to do at this
stage is register for an Amazon
developer account visit developer
amazon.com register if you haven't
already and sign in with your developer
account then when you've done that you
should be at the developer console click
Alexa at the top and from here we get
two things the Alexa skills kit and the
Alexa voice service
let's click the Alexa skills kit from
here we're given a list of any Alexa
skills that we have on the store but for
now we're going to click add a new skill
for the skill type I'm going to leave
that as a custom interaction model the
language of our skill is going to be
English the name of our skill I'm going
to call morning compliments and the
invocation name is essentially where we
say Alexa asked morning compliments for
a compliment so the invocation in will
be morning compliments and then we can
click Next
next we have to build what we call the
intent schema the list of intents that
we're going to put here our particular
functions that get called whenever we
see a particular phrase
so our model is going to look like this
we're going to have an intense area and
be first intent that we're going to
create is the get complement intent and
that's the one we're going to hook into
inside of our application so we get
compliments intent is going to be called
whenever we say a particular phrase such
as Alexa give me a compliment the other
intents which we're going to write in a
second are Amazon Alexa specific intent
some examples would be the Amazon help
intent which can be used to offer the
user some assistance in using the
application for example Alexa would
reply you can get a compliment by saying
give me a compliment this will make
sense later on as we get further into
the application just know that intense
can be used to call particular functions
so the next intent that will be writing
will be the Amazon dot intense the
Amazon dot star intent and finally the
Amazon cancel intent
like I said for now you don't have to
really understand this at this point
we'll be looking at this again in more
detail in the future we next need to add
a list of sample utterances these are
example phrases that we can use to
activate the application some example
utterances would be give me a compliment
tell me how awesome I look and something
like for a compliment
so when asking for a compliment so
whenever somebody says give me a
compliment we want to call the gets
compliments intent so we can add the
gets compliment intent before the phrase
so whenever somebody says give me a
compliment we are going to call this
function which will write inside of our
program in air moment so if we save this
we can then it click Next we now have to
create a lambda function for our Alexa
application let's head over to AWS
lambda to get started in doing this so
now we're the Amazon Web Services
dashboard if you haven't created an
Amazon Web Services account follow the
process and sign up for the free tier
you can do everything under the free
tier within this tutorial and the second
thing you need to make sure is that
you're selected under the North Virginia
location at the current time of
recording this Alexa is only available
in the North Virginia region for the
lambda functions so we'll have to make
sure that was signed in at the North
Virginia location when you've done that
head over to lambda by typing the lambda
inside the search box we then get a list
of lambda functions that we may have
created in the past if this is your
first time this is going to be empty and
then we can select create a lambda
function this is the function that we're
going to be creating and record for our
Alexa application
so click a blanket function
we can choose a trigger that invokes our
function if we select the box we can see
we have a variety of triggers that we
can select from we're going to select
the Alexa skills kit then we can press
next
to configure our function and add some
chords
let's call the function my confidence
builder and the description is going to
be for when you're feeling down
we can leave Nord ignored 6.1 and then
we can start writing some codes now you
can upload your chord as a zip file
instead of editing the chord in line so
I would suggest we do this let's head
over to our command prompt and make a
directory named Alexa tutorial let's CD
into that directory and then we can make
a new project so NPM in it and I'm going
to use - why so use all the defaults now
we can install be Alexa SDK so NPM
install Alexa - SDK and we can save it
to the project
we can then make the index guess that is
defined within our start so touch index
yes and finally let's open up in our
editor
so firstly let's make sure using strict
mode within our JavaScript so use strict
and then we can define some variables so
let's define an Alexa so first off we
can import the Alexa SDK and then give a
skill name for our up and then we can
make a list of complements that we want
to give the user so list of complements
and later on down line we're going to
create a function which gives these in a
random order so we can do VAR complement
list and make this equal to nu array we
can absolutely like damn son you're
looking mighty fine today you can add
whatever you want and then well you made
an Alexa skill you smarter than I
thought
and finally let's add if you were a food
you'd be an endless supply of cheesecake
let's leave our compliments list
advanced
now we can make the setup function for
our Alexa so if we make air handler and
this takes an events context and
callback we can set up Alexa by using
Alexa door handler and person then if
the event the context we can set our app
ID and we can add this to the list of
variables so of our output ID and we can
add this later on so we can go back and
change this just leave a blank for now
and then we have to do something call
register the handlers so the handlers
are for all intents and purposes the
intense that we defined within our
schema so let's first off go and make it
some handlers the first Candler that
we'll be creating is what's known as a
launch request and when the application
launches will be emitting the guests
compliment intent so let's make get
compliments and as a function and we'll
simply go on to return it rather than
compliment from the list so let's make
an index so or compliment index is equal
to mass dot floor and let's make a
random based on the length of the
complement of list so let's make your
master random from the compliment list
the length so effectively any one of
these three compliments
and then we can use the random index to
specify a particular message so random
compliments is equal to the compliment
list and then let's give an index and so
that would essentially now be either
complement list 0 1 or 2 based on the
random number that we get back from that
and we can then output this to speech
output is equal to your complement plus
random compliments
now we can make Alexis save this
compliment by using detail with card
events we could also just simply use
tell and I wouldn't display a card so
what does the card mean well if the user
has the Amazon echo application the
title of the card would be the skill
name and the string within the card
would be the outputs so let's do this
this damn it
and then the event will be tell with
card and sure you add that with
quotation marks then we want to give the
speech output the skill min
and finally the random compliment you
will remember that when we were creating
our Alexa application on the dashboard
we said that will be gets compliment
intent so we still have to write that
get compliment intent function and
within the get compliment intent we can
omit the get compliments events
so we've wrought our function like this
so we can omit the event from a variety
of different intents should we wish to
do that we also had a list of other
intents and if you remember it was
Amazon intense we had an Amazon dot stop
intent and finally we had an amazon.com
so intense so if we now write our help
intent we can say the speech output is
equal to and now this is some help that
we might want to give to the user so for
our user that's using the application we
would say you can say give me a
compliment or you can say exit and then
we might say something like what can I
help you with and then feel free to
customize that as much as you want and
we'll also make every prompt so we
initially say this which is a longer
version and then if we're going to
prompt the user again we'll say a
shorter version so make it reprint
variable and this will say what can I
help you with and then we can omit the
ask event
so similar to the other event we have
asked and asked with cards in this case
we're going to use the best to omit and
only going to use the asked event and
this takes two parameters the speech
outputs and beery prompt so whenever the
help intent is fired we're going to
initially say this and then see it the
second what can I help you with on our e
prompt now let's take a look at the stop
intent so when the application has
stopped we're simply going to tell a
user so we're going to look at the tell
event and we're going to say goodbye
this can also be copy pasted for our
cancel intent as both when the
application has stopped or when the
application is cancelled we want to say
goodbye
the final thing that we have to do is
register these handlers within our Alexa
application so we can say Alexa go
register handlers and then pass the
handlers variable in and finally we need
to run Alexa execute this initializes
our Alexa application with our handlers
and everything else looks like it's set
up correctly like I said we'll be coming
back to this app ID later on and we have
a list of complements that when we call
the get complement function it generates
a random compliment from the array and
simply says your compliments plus B
compliments we can then package our code
up into a zip file and upload it to the
lambda function that we were creating
earlier on so within our function select
upload a zip file and then upload it
under the function package
from here we need to create a custom
lambda function handler and role to do
this select create a custom role we can
then select create a new role and call
it lambda basic execution when you've
done that click allow and then select it
from the list and the existing role we
can then press next and create our
function if everything was created
successfully you should have
congratulations your lambda function has
been created successfully and configured
as a trigger from here select your er n
and copy that to the clipboard
we'll meet up because we'll be put in
the back in our lexer application that
we were creating earlier on so inside of
our amazon alexa dashboard if we head
back to the complements that we were
creating we can select Amazon AWS lambda
resource name and like I said we need to
make sure that this is a North America
and finally pace then the function when
you've done that click Next and now we
get to these fun bits from here we can
simulate what Alexis is so to test our
complements application we can add a
sample utterance inside of the service
simulator now I just tried this and as
it turns out it said the resource could
not be found and that is because inside
of our get compliments I actually had
speech out into that speech output so
make sure that you check your spellings
for your variables else you could spend
half an hour debugging something that
you don't even know why so back to the
project if we now give me a compliment
we can see that we get a response from
lambda and B content of the card is well
you made an Alexis skill you're smarter
than I thought if we ask again we get
another random compliment this time it's
a damn Sun you're looking a mighty fine
today
and finally if we check it again we get
our final one which is if you are a food
you'd be an endless supply of cheesecake
so that proves that our Alexis skill
does work if we click Next we can now
look at ways in which we can publish
this to the store so category first
would be novelty and humor
and would have to add any specific
testing instructions here to the person
I will be reviewing me up so simply say
give me a compliment is all I'm going to
add we would like this to be in every
single region you can restrict this to
particular countries and regions if you
want and we'll add a short skill
description so when you're feeling down
Alexa has you covered at what you want
here and as well for the folder skill
description go crazy here we'll need to
add some example phrases so the example
phrases that I'm going to add are Alexa
open morning compliments Alexa asked
morning compliments and finally give me
a compliment so these are some example
phrases that we can use to activate the
application we can then add specific
keywords
they'll help our application be found in
the store so keywords would be novelty
humor and compliment you can add as many
as you want here and finally we would
need some images that we can add to our
application so we now have 108 500 nib
pixel image and a 512 by 512 pixel image
so we have both small and large icons
let's save this and head over to the
final section so the final section
details the global fields for our
privacy and compliance form does this
skill allow users to purchase or spend
real money nope does this skill collect
users personal information well nope it
doesn't and no it doesn't target
children under the age of 13 this is all
gonna be different for you and of course
this right now is just a super big
example so feel free to tailor this to
your application let's see this and
finally submit for certification one
we've done that we get skill submission
initiated the submission process your
skill has been initiated and you should
receive this response from Amazon soon I
found that it takes anywhere between one
to two days for a resolution and often
times if you've done everything
correctly it gets spread to the store so
there we are we've created our first
Amazon Alexa application if you found
this useful hit that subscribe button to
stay up to date with more tech tutorials
and until next time my name is Paul
Halliday and I'll see you in the next
