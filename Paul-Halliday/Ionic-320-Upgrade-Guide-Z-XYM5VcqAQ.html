covering the ionic 3.20 release this
release contains numerous bug fixes
features on performance improvements and
we've got to take a look at taking our
current project and upgrading that to
3.20 it should also be stated that you
will have to add the ionic CLI plugin
for ionic angular and the CLI plugin for
Cordova
if you've yet to do that now that you've
upgraded to the ionic CLI version 3 I
have a project here that currently
contains ionic 3.11
and we're going to look at changing this
to instead be ionic three to zero I'm
agreeing to the following dependencies
ignore the angular fire and firebase
dependencies I will add this list to the
description and of course if we ensure
that we remove our node modules we
should then be able to say npm install
from within our project directory if
we've done everything correctly our
modules should be installed and you may
find that you get a couple of warnings
here in there providing that they're not
or as you should be or care to continue
with the installation
now if you've also upgraded to the ionic
3 CLI you may also have to include the
CLI plugins for ionic angular and
Cordova let's ensure we've done that by
running the following command I'll add
this to the description this will add
the plugin for ionic annular and once
I've done that we'll need to install the
plugin for Cordova so let's do that by
installing me ionic CLI plug-in Cordova
and our project should now be up and
running with ionic 3 to 0 under the
ionic 3 CLI let's run ionic serve and we
find our application is now up and
running without any issues we can also
type ionic info to check the current
version of ionic and this is confirmed
by saying the app scripts is 1 or 3 7
the COI plug-ins are 1 0 0 and our ionic
angular version is 3 to 0 so hopefully
this video allows you to get started
with the ionic 3 to 0 upgrade and help
you install
both CLI plugins if you haven't central
upgrading to the CLI version 3 if you
have to upgrade to ionic CLI version 3
don't forget a check out that video over
on at the channel and finally if you
want a course that takes you through
learning ionic theory from scratch
don't forget let's check out we learn
ionic theory from scratch course I've
got a discount cord for that in the
description and until next time I'll see
you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
