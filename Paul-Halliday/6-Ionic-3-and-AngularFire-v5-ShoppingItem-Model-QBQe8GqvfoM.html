our shopping item inside of the source
folder I'm going to create a new folder
called models and inside of here we can
make a fold on called item and if file
called item modeled on TS we can then
export a new interface named item and we
can think of some things that our item
may have so it could have a key which is
a string so that's the key for this
particular item when we add it to the
firebase database we also know that we
have a name which is a string a quantity
which is a number and a price which is a
number if you're making a different
application and your model will
subsequently be different remember to
keep this in mind as you develop your
applications so we're now able to define
one item looks like so we can go over to
our add shopping item don TS and inside
of here
we can create a new item and that will
be based off the item interface and it
will have a name which will be empty a
quantity of 0 and a price of zero we'll
need to import the item model we can
head back over to our ad shopping items
or HTML and we can set the ng model of
each one of our inputs to the item name
this time it will be item dog quantity
and finally item dot price
I
it also said that we have added this
question mark for this key inside of the
item model and this essentially says
that the key is optional so when we're
creating these objects we don't need to
add a key because that's what firebase
is going to do for us another thing at
this point we could 2% the quantity and
price to be undefined and that's if we
didn't want to for example give this a
default of value but when I then want to
do is underneath the iron item and above
the button
I want to bind to the item and use the
JSON pipe can then set iPad pro quantity
of one and price of 700 notice how we
get this information as part of this
object when we fill out our item which
we could then hit add and would add this
to the database
so let's now hook up that functionality
so we can add this to our shopping list
that's all coming up in the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
