allows me to make native mobile
applications with ease today we're going
to look at a view and native script it's
a relatively new addition to the
front-end frameworks that you can use
with native script so what we need to do
is create a new native script project by
first ensuring we have native script
installed let's run npm install near the
script - g and that of course will
install Netta script globally so we can
use it throughout our terminal next we
can create a new project with TNS create
and we'll call our project view NS and
we'll use the templates native script -
view - template hit and run of course
that will install our dependencies and
create the project after that we can see
the interview in US and then run Tina's
run iOS and of course also open this up
inside of Visual Studio codes if we take
a look at leaf project here on the
amulet so we can see that we have a very
basic app that has a few different
features such as an alert and buttons
and labels being displayed on screen
we're going to create our own
application that's going to display a
list view and of course get some data
from a rest endpoint so we'll head over
to app yes and this is of course the
main entry point for our application
I'll start off by deleting the entire
file because we want to create this from
scratch will then require view so let's
say Const view is equal to require
native script - view and we want to get
man from dist
and index we can anchor it a new view
instance and our view instance can have
a template and this will be a very basic
template that simply has a page and an
action bar will give the action bar a
title of users as this will simply
display a list of users in order to
bootstrap our application we'll need to
say don't
Dola starts on our view instance and
then going to define some data and the
data will be a basic uses a rare inside
of that uses array we might have
something like an ID a name a username
and a potential email address we then be
able to take this and display this on
screen with a stack layout and a list
view so let's add a stack layout to our
templates and inside of our stack
layouts we'll add a list view the list
view will have a template and we'll
scorp our templates at a user this will
allow us to get a reference of the
current item in which will bind the
items inside of the list be using :
items that will allow us to get access
to the users array which then of course
will be able to say user name user dot
user name and so on so here we have a
very simple stack layout once again and
inside of the stack around we can have
some labels we can bind to the text
input on the level so user dot name user
user name and finally user don't email
if we save our project you can see that
we now have a list view with some items
on screen we can make our list view take
up a hundred percent of the width by
simply saying list - view and the height
of which will be a hundred view height
I'm also gonna give our stack layout a
class of list and for that class we will
simply give that a margin of 20 pixels
that looks much better
what I want to do now is access HTTP so
we can get some data from our REST API
let's head over to our view instance and
define some methods
inside of methods we can make a get data
function and inside of here we need to
access HTTP so let's require HTTP from
HTTP and we can also add a view instance
property so let's add a view dot
prototype doll HTTP equal to the HTTP
that we just required we can then say
this don't don't let hich TTP and then
we can use against JSON and will pass
through HTTP JSON placeholder
don't type accord com slash users and
this will give us a response in which we
can set then capture our response and
we'll set our users equal to the
response map and this will map over our
response and we can craft a user object
by returning in iam equal to username
username equal to user dot username and
finally an email equal to user email so
now we have a method that allows us to
get some data from the server but how do
we call it method when our application
is created well we can hunky into the
created lifecycle hug inside of here we
can answer this don't get data I'm gonna
go back to up don't CSS and change this
to a hundred percent height instead of
view height I'm also going to add code
on dark don't CSS instead of the light
theme then inside of our app dot Jess we
can add the action bar class to our
action bar and if we take a look at our
application we have an application which
we can scroll up and down that has
communicated with a REST API and uses
native script view this video has a
corresponding blog post over at blog

information or just as a reference point
thanks a lot for watching don't forget

native script and view content let me
also know inside of the comment section
what you think and until next time my
name is Paul and I'll see you very soon
