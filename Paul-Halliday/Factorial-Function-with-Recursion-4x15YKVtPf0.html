looking at a variety of different
problems and solutions over at cord wars
this allows us to play with a variety of
sample problems and algorithms and the
first thing that we'll be looking at is
recursion the problem context at the
moment is to create a factorial function
as we can see in mathematics the
factorial of a non-negative integer n so
if we had the integer 5 it can be
denoted by n bang and it's the product
of all the positive integers less than
or equal to n so if we had 5 bang
that'll be the product of 5 4 3 2 and 1
giving us 120 total and the factorial of
zero is 1 so this means we need to
create a function that checks to see
whether first off we have a positive
number whether that number is 0 and
otherwise we want to recursively call
this function subtracting 1 from our
integer so inside of our editor I'm
going to make an e constant and that's
going to be called factorial and it's
going to be equal to n of type number
and it's going to return a number and
the function body looks like this
initially we'll return 0 and we'll
double check this works by capturing at
the output and we'll just say the
factorial of a hundred at this point and
by simply saying fact here because I'm
using quokka we can see that we get 0 as
expected
so let's first off say well we want to
return if n is less than 0 so ensure
that we have a positive number we want
to return minus 1 but instead if n is
equal to 0 then we want to return one
because that's the factorial of zero
because that's necessary for our
function and finally we want to say well
if it's not zero instead we want to call
n
times the factorial function that we've
created which is n minus 1 so if we
change this to instead be the factorial
of 5 we get 120 so let's lock it in a
bit more detail of what exactly it is
that we've done here we first off
ensured that our function is taking in a
number that's greater than 0 if our
number happens to be 0 we return 1 else
if it's greater than 0 because we've
already checked to see whether it's less
than 0 we want to call that number times
the factorial function which is this
section of the function add that
factorial is simply the number minus 1
so this then calls itself up until the
number hits 0 and when the number hit 0
this function is no longer called so
that's how the function is called at
this many times as you can see if we
type n using quanta we can see it was
initially called with 5 and 4 3 2 1 and
0 let's take our work and copy that and
we'll paste it inside of chord wars
remove the end because we're no longer
inside avoid development environment and
hit run sample tests hopefully all of
our tests will pass and as you can see
all of our tests passed based on the
appropriate factorials Sall hit attempt
which shunts submit our tests and we'll
be able to see other people's solutions
here are some other solutions so we have
a factorial constant which takes in a
number and returns a number and this
simply checks to see whether the number
is greater than 1 if it is then of
course we will use the factorial
function and the same way that we did
will recursively call it n minus 1 and
then we'll return it 1 if it is not
greater than 1 so we seem to have a lot
of similar solutions here is another one
that lux are using the F blocks instead
of ternary statements like we did but I
think overall there's only so many ways
he can do this and that's how we use
recursion inside of JavaScript
you crazy mother
