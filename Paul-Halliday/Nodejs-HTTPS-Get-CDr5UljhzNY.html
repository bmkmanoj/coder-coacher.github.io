at using HTTP gets inside of owen order
applications so I've got a new node up
and I'm going to say Const HTTP is equal
to require HTTP this allows us to use
the HTTP library inside of our app let's
then start off by saying HTTP don't get
as you can see we need to pass in some
options the options that will be passing
then is simply a URL and that will be
HTTP JSON placeholder dot type record
calm and we'll be looking for slash
users this will give us a list of ten
users and after that we can capture the
response callback so we have this res
object and the res object allows us to
fast look at the status code so let's
simply log out the res dot status cord
as well as res dot headers and now
before the headers if we simply run our
application already by saying no des you
can see that we get a list of headers as
well as our status cord of 200 so we're
halfway there now we need to capture the
dinner so we'll comment these out for
now and in order to capture the day we
have to capture the data event so let's
say response dot on and the events that
we're going to be looking for is the
data event this gives us access to our
did a chunk and we'll look at this in a
second and if we simply log out that
data so do the same while clay the
console will run the skin you can see
that we have the data in various
different chunks this is what's known as
a buffer
and in order to capture this we need to
create a new variable and I'm going to
call this a body and then we will of
course append the chunk on to our body
when that the data is finished it will
fire the end event and inside of here we
can simply log our body let's clear the
console and then of course run at Nord
GS as you can see we then have a variety
of different information about our users
this matches everything that we expected
from our API as well as that we can hook
into the on our event and we could
console Dora any errors using error
message so that's how we would like it
HTTP GET inside of our node applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
