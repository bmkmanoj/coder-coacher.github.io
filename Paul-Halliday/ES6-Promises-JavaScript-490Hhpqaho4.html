we'll be locking it promises inside es6
to there if you've never seen a promise
before or you've never used one you can
think of a promise as a function that
has a callback method when it's complete
the awesome thing about promises is that
they don't have to be synchronous we can
maybe call a server for some data and
when that server responds we can then do
something after that so let's start off
by writing our first promise with es6 we
can make a variable named promise so let
promise is equal to a new promise and if
we look at the parameters of the promise
we can see that we have a resolve and a
reject the resolve is for resolving
things that are true or correct and the
reject is for usually resolving errors
so we can add the resolve and reject
parameters to our promise and then we
can create a value which I'm gonna put
is true and then if that value is true
I'm going to resolve the promise with
this value is true if the value is not
true I'm going to reject the promise and
say this value is not true so to use the
callback for the promise itself we can
use promise dot then and you can see
that the promise it takes two parameters
both of which are optional be
unfulfilled and the on rejected so the
unfulfilled means the resolve here and
the on rejected is the reject so we can
have resolved and then we can log out be
resolved so resolved at this moment in
time will be this value here so this
value is true
and if there's any errors we can consult
our theorem can make this a little
easier to read so if we run this in the
console we can see that this value is
true we got this value from logging out
the resolve from within our promise that
means if we put this value to false and
we run it again
we get this value is not true because
promises can run asynchronously we could
lock it getting some data from a server
and then when we get that data we're
gonna put it back into our function I'm
gonna simulate this by making it timeout
so set timeout and then after a
three-second period we can either
resolve or reject the promise so if
we've run this again we can say this
value is not true after the 3 second
timeout to prove that this works once
again for the true value we can see
after running it for 3 seconds it now
resolves as true if you've ever used
angular 1 and the dollar cue library
you'll find that this is quite similar
to what you already did back then you
might have had a dollar kudo resolve a
Dalek you don't reject and I saw on I
hope this video helps in understanding
promises in es6 and if it does hit that
subscribe button because there's more
videos on the way and until next time my
name is Paul how idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
