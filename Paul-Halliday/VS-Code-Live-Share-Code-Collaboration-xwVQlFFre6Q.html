looking at the visual studio called live
share plugin which allows you and one or
more people to collaborate on the same
project so right now we have a flutter
project open that simply allows us to
have a container with a height and width
of 200 and a color of teal
we've decided though that were stuck and
we don't know how to get rid of this
height and width so we're gonna pull in
somebody else to give us a hand with
this project so this starts off by
looking at the Extension store and we
CVS live share we want to install this
inside of our Visual Studio cords and
the great thing is is actually you can
use Visual Studio with this plugin too
so you don't need to use vs cords and
you can also collaborate with people in
a different IDE so we've already
installed this the next thing you'd like
to do is that sign in at the bottom of
the screen inside of the status bar so
if we look at the status bar here inside
of vs code we can see that says pull
yours should say sign in at this point
to either sign in with your Microsoft
accounts or github and then you'll be
able to collaborate with other people so
after signing in let's hit share and
this will give us a URL which we can
share with other people and they'll be
able to join our project as you can see
the invite link has been copied to the
clipboard so now I'm gonna send this to
somebody else so I've now invited
somebody else to the project and the
great thing about this is that it takes
all of the context of your IDE across to
the other person's machine so the files
that we have open open up on their
machine and also the context of the
debugger opens up obviously you need to
have a similar environment so you can't
open up the iOS SDK on Windows as an
example but hopefully Katie will be able
to delete the height width and margin
elements from our container
you see any selection from the other
person appears on our screen and we can
see instantly as it's deleted if Katie
was then to save the file you'll see
that we also get the file saved on our
machine it's not simply then local to
that other person so now that we've got
rid of the height width and margin if we
update our flood application using hot
reload we can see the changes and
effects here on our emulator so if this
was a real problem and I was stuck and I
wanted a review from a collaborator I
could easy now invite them using vs
codes I'm a big fan of this feature and
I think that it's going to be really
popular when it comes out of preview and
it's 100% stable let me know what you
think inside of the comment section
below will you use this in your work
environments if you'd like to see more
content like this have a subscribe
button hit that like button and then
until next time I'll see you soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
