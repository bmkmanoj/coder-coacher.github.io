buttons within native script we're going
to be looking at this on iOS but the
concepts are the same for Android and
I'll just simply like different let's
start by heading over to our app
component ES and I'm going to add a new
button to this component and we can add
this to the template like so and if we
give this button the text of your class
just the stare that there's no class
associated with this button we get of
course a button without or background
but it is clickable and I'm going to add
these buttons to is back layout and be
second button of odds odds has the
classic simply BTN so the text will be
of course just BTN so we can understand
what's going on and you'll notice I it's
slightly different this time it applies
the base styles of the native script
core theme and of course includes the
appropriate dimensions and spacing so
it's different to the button without any
class let's do this in now but let's add
primary so let's say BTM BTN - primary
and we can do the same of for our class
this now adds the primary color of our
theme to the button as well as the BTN
class so we have the appropriate spacing
we also have other buttons such as BTN -
outline and that gives us an outline
button so like a sort of transparent
button and we can click anywhere within
that boundary box can do the same for
BTN rounded sm we can also have BTN -
primary - this and we'll be able to see
what this looks like as you see we have
a small amount of rounded corners where
we could do the same but now instead of
rounded small rounded large with LG and
this gives us is significantly more
rounded button and finally we can look
at the active so we could set BTN -
active and this makes the button appear
highlighted when done so if we click
this we can see that it gets a sort of
highlighted functionality if we remove
the Prime
we also see that same theme so if we
click the button once again it's all
highlights the entire button so these
are just some ways in which you can
theme your buttons within native script

know inside of the comments section
below until next time my name is Paul
and I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
