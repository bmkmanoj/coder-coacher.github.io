using charts from within candor UI for
annular to get started I'm going to make
an new project named Kendall charts with
the angular cui so let's use ng new
Kendall - charts now that that is
complete we can see the enter Kendall -
charts will now need to install the
dependencies from within our project so
I'm going to do this by installing the
Kendall angular charts package the
localization packages the drawing
package
hamaji s and angular animations as you
can see this quite a few packages here
so I'll add this to the description and
if you've not set up your NPM registry
to target progress yet visit the first
introduction to Kendall UI video here on
the channel so let's install these
dependencies now that that's complete we
can see ng serve - or a mess we'll open
our project inside of the browser and
then going to open this up inside a
visual studio chords the first thing
that we have to do is import our
dependencies into our root our module so
let's head over to up at module TF and
import the following we'll need the
browser animations module so let's
import that from angular slash platform
browser slash animations we can add that
to the list of imports next we'll need
the charts module so let's import that
from Progress slash Kendall - Angela -
charts we can then add that to the list
of imports and then we'll also need to
import some a GS we can now head over to
our app component the HTML and from
within here we can add ourselves a
candle - charts we can give the chart a
title using Kendall - charts - title and
we can help you enter the text attribute
here and we can see the text is equal to
student exam results because we'll be
using an example of student exam results
inside of all our components I'm going
to have a user RAM and this is
we going to be in a rare of type number
equal to 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 we can
pass this into our chart by saying the
category axis is equal to that year's
array we next need to add a legend for
our chart so you can say Kendall - chart
- legend and from within here we can add
a position of bottom and an orientation
of horizontal next we want to put the
data for our chart inside of the Kendall
- chart - series so inside the series
would have a series item so it's a
Kendall gasps chart - series - item and
for each one of the items we can do an
ng for so it can iterate over this
series item and we can say let student
of students so let's now create advanced
students a rare so we have our students
and the students array is going to
contain four different students so say
the first student has n name of Paul and
the results each year is equal to year
one was ninety year two with 77 year
three was 94 and year four was thirty so
not a good year for let's make some more
mock data right here inside of our
students are rare this one can be
kidding this one can be Biv and finally
this one can be Sarah let's make some
mock data for each one of these and as
you can see now were left with this
students array with a variety of
different results bunk inside our
templates we can then add the type of
chart that we want to add so if we for
example had a line chart we could use
the data attributes to bind to that
student results and finally the name
attributes to bind to the student name
so if we take a look in the browser at
the moment we do find that we have an or
styling and nothing is there let's
import the default theme within our
project we can see npm install at
progress slash Kendall - theme - default
let's save this to the project as well
with - - save and now we have to import
that style sheet which is an S CSS style
sheet and you might be in the same
position as me at the moment with your
project you generated SCSS project with
the angular CLI and you need to instead
generate an S CSS project with the
angular CLI I'm going to head over to
the angular CLI go JSON and instead
within our Styles I'm going to say
styles got a CSS and our default
extensions I will put a CSS for our
style extension let's quickly rename our
style sheet our app component to a CSS
and tell our of component es that we're
now using s CSS then inside of our
Styles Don scss let's import the theme
that we just installed into the project
we can do that we're seeing US imports
progress slash Kendall - theme - default
/ s CSS / all let's now restart our
project so there we have it we have our
student exam results but there's a
little problem because we don't actually
have our bottom axes and that's because
our category axes needs to state that
the categories is actually that yours
are in so if we save the file we can now
see that we have 2012 2013 2014 and 2015
what if we wanted to display this
information as it bar chart we certainly
code we can change the type to be bar
and there we have it we have now a bar
chart for each one of the years for each
person it will also be a good idea to
see a tooltip when we hover over one of
these results so let's do that by adding
a tooltip to our chart if we say Kendall
- chart
- tooltip we can add it to attempt to
our chart so now if I hover over 2012
Paul we can see that it's 90 cm for
caddy
we can go down for dev which is a 50
and Sarah which is it ten what if we
want to click on this chart and get some
particular response from that well we
can do that by saying series click let's
have a look now by saying chart item
clicked and pass in an event here if we
write the function inside of our app
component chart item clicked as well as
the events we can console but log the
event for that click if I now open the
console and click one of the charts we
can see that there was a series click
event for that chart item another good
thing is that you can see the chart
actually is responsive to the window
size so if we check this out on a few
mobile devices
it looks good no matter whether the
thorn is horizontal or vertical so in
