something called content projection I'll
give you a quick example of how this
works and we can head over to our named
component dot HTML at this point in time
we have a very simple component that
simply displays in name on screen inside
of a paragraph tag but what if you're
passing this component off to somebody
else or you want to give this component
a dynamic template so perhaps you want
to instantiate eight different templates
in different times throughout our
application well for this we'd use
something called content projection and
this is where we adds an NG - content
tag into our component so prior to this
I'm gonna add a quick paragraph tag that
simply says name
and then underneath we are going to have
that ng-content
save the file right now and we can then
see that we have this name on screen but
we do not have our person's name and the
way that we do that is head back over to
our app component door HTML so inside of
our app component if we take a look in
our name components we currently have
three instances each time we're passing
in this name equal to Paul Halliday then
John Doe and Sara Dorer at this point in
time I want to remove the name input
just because we're using content
projection doesn't mean that we
shouldn't have an input in this scenario
I just want to show how we can use
different templates for the same
components so let's do the same now and
add h1 for Paul Halliday
I'll add a hedge - for John doar and a
hitch three for Sara Dorer and if we
save the file and I'm simply going to
zoom out a little bit you can see that
we have three different templates for
the same components this is using
something called content projection so
essentially anything inside of that ng
content is simply being injected into
this component now you don't have to
follow along at this point you can
simply watch but if we were to provide
our app components with a list of names
for example if we simply said Paul
Holliday and we'll change the other
names for now so that'll be Kevin Smith
and then of course something like teri
Johnson I'm going to remove all of the
other chord at this point because we
don't need the view children or the view
child anymore we can also remove our
implements and import for after view and
it's and I'll remove the button at two
so we're left with this app components
and simply has the apnea three times
let's remove the other two times and
we'll do an NG four on this component
this allows us to simply say let's name
of NIMS and of course we can pass in the
name as an input
that's awesome for us because then we
can define the template that we want
using content projection so if we then
bounce to the name
you can see that now our component apnea
is rendering this component three times
but we get to decide how we want our
template to like for example if we
wanted to use this in a different
scenario and instead we wanted these to
be paragraph tags by being able to
change it like this we have a lot more
flexibility so that's how we can start
using content projection so why don't
you play around with content projection
yourself use ng content to dynamically
create a template for your components
use ng four to iterate solve your
component multiple times and this will
allow you to truly see the benefits of
dynamic templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
