at upgrading our ionic project to
version a 3.5 X we're also going to take
a look at upgrading our app script to B
to point X and above as this does
contain a breaking change the breaking
changes should be worth at all because
our incremental builds should be much
faster now that we have the vendor files
in the owner file so let's upgrade our
project what we need to do is start off
by removing our node modules
and the first thing to do is of course
upgrade our ionic angular 23.5 to so if
we install the latest version of that
that should update our package JSON and
the next thing to do is upgrade our app
scripts so I'm going to run npm install
ionic app scripts version 2.0 or two of
course if we enter the add - - save and
save exact the same way as we did with
our ionic dependency now if we go ahead
and run npm install it should go ahead
and install the appropriate packages
inside of our packaged or json if we now
run ionic serve you may also find that
you get this RS in that you cannot find
angular TSE wrapped don't we run out
simply npm install at angular TSE -
wrapped
and fewer to add - - save if you're not
running NPM five and above and now you
should be able to try I honor them
awesome they forgot this farm we get web
pipe juice on P is not defined then what
we need to do is head over to our
index.html and simply add among them add
a comments here to say that the vendor
files is everything inside of Nord
modules you need to add a script here
with the source could build slash vendor
GS make sure that you add it above this
mentor JS file here and if you've done
that you should be able to find that you
can navigate back to your application
and of course it will be running the
latest version of ionic app scrubs and
of course the latest version of ionic
angular so there was a minor breaking
change here this is the only one which
is simply adding the build slash vendor
Doge s inside of our index.html but
it'll be worth it in the end for the
speed that we get back at Build time so
thanks a lot for watching I hope you
have a smooth upward process don't
forget a check out learn ionic III from
scratch I do have some super bundles
over a Paul Halliday tile that contains
the ionic net of course learner anak
three and of course AB prototyping with
experience design so until next time
I'll see you very soon in that next
