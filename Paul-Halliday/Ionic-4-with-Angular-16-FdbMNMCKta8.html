at using ionic 4 which is in very very
early alpha with angular 1.6 so you may
have seen my video of using ionic 4 with
view GS and if you haven't I would
definitely recommend you check that out
here on the channel but today we'll be
looking at doing the same thing with
angular 1.6 so let's make a new ionic
angular application and that's gonna be
done by making a new directory called
ionic angular 1.6
we can CD into ionic - angular 1.6 and
inside of here we can start off by
making a new file called index.html and
that's of course where we're gonna set
up our HTML page and import all of our
scripts as well as that I also want to
make it user module GS a user controller
GS and a user dot service dot GS after
that we can open this up inside of our
editor and at the same time we can also
run HTTP server on this directory if you
haven't installed this use NPM install
HTTP server - G and that will allow us
to run this application here in the
browser so let's start out at index dot
HTML and I'm going to use Emmet to
scaffold a new HTML page if you haven't
used Emma before or you aren't
well-versed with it don't forget to
check out my Emma video here on the
channel so after that we have a standard
HTML document I'm gonna change the title
to ionic angular 1 point X and as we've
already created our three files I want
to import them using scripts source will
import the user module yes and it's
important that we give it the type of
module this is going to allow us to
import JavaScript modules and this will
only be available in Linton's of chrome
and other browsers I'm not saying you
should necessarily use this for
production at this point but what we're
doing is because we're not using a build
step right now we're simply using type
module so we can use the import syntax
I'd recommend using something like
typescript or bubble if you are gonna
use this in production but ionic 4 is in
very very early alpha so I wouldn't
bother using it in production just yet
the next thing is to import the angular
script and the ionic script
let's start off by importing angular and
after that we need to import ionic core
once we have imported both of these
currents I would recommend checking the
JavaScript console just and sure we have
no errors at this point doesn't look
like we do so we can continue with our
application what I'm then going to do is
add ng - up equal to user app and that's
what we're going to call this
application so this essentially allows
us to use angular inside of our hitch
tml page awesome so what I'm going to do
now is start backwards and the user
service so instead of using the module
fast we're going to create this service
I can be done by exporting a default
class and I'll call this the user
service and this user service needs to
use HTTP so what we have to do is inject
this my same user service dollar inject
and we'll want to inject don't let HTTP
into the service now if you are using
angular one point X in production there
are other things that you can use at
this point which will take care of this
injection but for now we'll just do it
like this well then get a reference to
this inside of our constructor and we'll
assign this Don HTTP equal to the HTTP
that we've injected therefore at this
point we can create a new gap function
which will return this store HTTP don't
yet and we'll use the JSON placeholder
don't type code comm slash users for
some dummy data
and then when we get that we'll simply
return the response dinner that's all
our user service needs to do at this
point we can then head over to our user
controller da GS and at this point we
can export a default class name to user
controller we can follow these same
principles as before with the injection
but this time I want to inject the user
service and that's the service that we
just created and we can then of course
create a new constructor which passes in
that user service and we can assign this
that user service equal to the user
service that we've injected we can then
create a get users function and that
will say this dot user service don't get
and after that has completed we can pass
the users to this dot people and we'll
subsequently sure this dot people on
screen so we may want to assign the
distal people equal to an empty array
and after that we can say this don't get
users we could certainly design this
controller much bad but for now that
will do and we can head over to our user
module is finally and here we can just
import our user controller from user
controller dot yes and I will use a
service from user service da yes and
then here we can set up our angular
module we want to call this module user
app we want to pass through nothing so
essentially we just instantiating in new
module for our controller we want to
call this the user controller and pass
through the user controller that we
imported and finally for our factory
I want to call this the user service and
we'll pass through the user service that
we imported finally with all of our
logic in place we can create a simple
user interface which uses the ionic UI
components I'm just going to do this
inside of the body tag at this point in
time so we'll have an ion app which will
have an eye on page inside of our page
you will have an iron head up with a
toolbar inside of the header and a title
inside of the toolbar this title will be
ionic 4 plus angular 1.6 and will also
give the ion page the class of Shore
page next we'll have some iron content
inside of the iron content we'll have an
ion list and we'll do a list of items by
using ng-repeat
on the list of items so set P in and at
this point we need to access that people
variable so in order to do that I'm
going to assign the ng - controller on
of our body as the user controller as VM
so then we can set P in VM dot people
therefore inside of our item we can have
an ion label with p.m. as the label it
looks like I've accidentally ended the
eye on page a bit early so let's move
that down to underneath the content and
when we refresh our page you can then
see that we now have this ionic angular
application we've gotten some people
from an API we're displaying a user bar
at the top here which has the title of
ionic 4 and angular 1.6 we're using an
ionic Leicester to display these items
with the ion item and ion label inside
of that list so this angular 1.6
application does leave a lot of
to be desired there's many things which
he could change to improve but this is
supposed to be a rough-and-ready
application that gets us up and running
with ionic 4 and angular 1.6
I hope already you can see just how
versatile ionic 4 is going to be with
stencil it's going to allow us to
upgrade our old ionic 1 point X projects
much easier than simply writing in new
ionic 2 plus application there's also a
small percentage of organizations that
can't support angular 4 point X and have
to be on angular 1 point X but also want
to use the power of ionic we may find
that in the future ionic 4 is a great
accurate strategy for those people if
