calm and today we are going to create a
flashlight application with ionic 2 and
ionic native 3.1 so to start with head
over to your repos directory and create
a new app named flashlight based on the
blank templates and an ionic 2 app with
the dash dash V 2 okay now we can CD
into that directory saw this CB
flashlight then we need to add both the
Cordova plug-in and the ionic need of
plugin for the flashlight sort of start
with run ionic plug-in adds Cordova
plug-in flashlight now let's save that
to the project then we'll also install
the ionic native rubber by using NPM
install ads ionic - native slash
flashlight and we'll save that to the
project - and then going to open up in
vs chord using chord dots the first
thing that we need to do and this is the
same for any ionic native plugin is the
head over to app module TS and import
our flashlight from ionic need of /
flashlights after that we need to add it
to our providers list so we can add
flashlights to providers and then I'm
gonna head over to home HTML let's
quickly add a little template so ionic
to flashlight and I'm going to change
the color of the navbar
to primary
inside of our iron content we'll need an
iron fab inside the fab container will
be a button and the color of the button
will simply be light and inside the
button will have an iron icon which is
simply going to be iOS flash outline the
father will be in the bottom center of
the page the next thing to do is head
over to home to TS and import flashlight
from ionic native so can import it from
ionic native flashlight just that and
then we can inject it inside of our
constructor so private flashlight
flashlight and the first thing that I
want to do is check to see where the
flashlight is available or not on the
device so to do that we'll make an async
function so use async in our project we
need to go to the TS config and change
our target from es5 to es6 so our
function will return a boolean to
determine whether the flashlight is
available so we can do you think is
available and this will return a promise
of which will be a boolean so we can try
to return the resolved promise of this
dot flashlight dot available and this is
going to determine whether the device
supports the flashlight or not and if we
can't we're simply going to log out to
the error right now I'm simply gonna
make our fab button have this click
event so we'll have click is available
and for testing purposes we could simply
put this to a value
and log it out so when we click our
button on the desktop we get cordova not
available and this is because it tried
to get the available flashlight and of
course couldn't so it logged out the
catch function on the device that should
work that will return either true or
false depending on whether it's actually
available on that device so for now we
can simply go back to returning the
result and now we want to write the
functionality to toggle the flashlight
so essentially we want to toggle the
flashlights to an on or off state we can
get whether the flashlight is available
or not if it is available we can toggle
the flashlight toggle the is on variable
that will create in a second and if it
isn't available
we'll simply log out to the console so
fairly straightforward simply toggling
the flashlight on or off and then
updating the is on variable which we'll
use to change the color of the fab on
inside of our view so let's write this
function I will do a sync toggle flash
and this will return a promise of type
void
we'll start off by determining whether
the flashlight is available or not so
let available is equal to the resolved
promise of this dot is available if it
is available then we want to resolve
this dot flashlight toggle and after
that struggled we want to simply add
this dot is on is equal to the opposite
of this that is on so we need to make
that boolean at the top and we'll
initialize it to false so essentially we
want to say if we do toggle the
flashlight then we're going to turn that
this dot is on from false to true and if
it isn't available we're simply gonna
log out isn't available now because
we've created this is on variable we can
of course determine whether the
flashlight is on or off so we can simply
go to our color of our button and we can
basically say if the flashlight is on
then we want to display the secondary
color if it's not you want to display it
light so let's pretend that's on by
changing
is on to true and we should see in our
view that our button turns green so
let's do the same for our ion icon we
can say if it's on then we want to put
iOS flash if it's not on we want to put
iOS flash outline as you can see our
flash is filled in to determine that
it's on and if we put this to false it
should go back to gray and it should be
an outline so the last thing we need to
do is now change our button click event
to toggle flash and if we test this on
the device it should of course a toggle
our flash from on so off as well as
updating the UI to show these results
the flash light also has other functions
which you can use we could make a sync
turn on flash which returns a promise
avoid and we could resolve the promise
by saying away this stop flashlight dot
switch on and this would of course
switch on the flashlight we have turn
off flash which we could also create and
that's simply this dot flashlight switch
off instead of using your local
variables such as this dot on to
determine whether the flashlight is on
or off we could use async is flash on
and this returns a promise of type
boolean and we could return the result
promise of this dot flashlight dot is
switched on then we would get the result
of depending whether the flashlight
switched on or off this will be good if
you want to use it across components
rather than our simple use kiss right
