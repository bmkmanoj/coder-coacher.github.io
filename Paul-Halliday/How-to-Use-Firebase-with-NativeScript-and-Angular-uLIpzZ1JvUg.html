firebase with native script and angular
was simply just going to get the
integration up and running in this video
we're not gonna look at authentication
or databases or anything like that we
just want to initialize firebase inside
of the app so if you haven't already you
want to install native script like so by
running NPM install native script - G
you will of course need Android studio
and Xcode for this so do make sure that
you have them installed before running
the command after that we're going to
create a new project and this is going
to be called native script firebase we
are gonna run the template of native
scripts templates ng tutorial and we're
also going to set an app ID now why are
we setting an app ID well because at the
moment when we start our project the app
ID would be something like com don't
native script dot native script by this
and well that's fine and you can change
that inside a package.json we will need
to be interacting with this app ID in a
second so I'm gonna set a custom one of
I or Paul holiday dot NS fire so hit
enter and this all go ahead and create
the project and download the
dependencies after that we are going to
CD into native scripts of five s and
then we're going to install the native
script plug in firebase let's add TNS
plugin adds native script - a plug-in -
a firebase and now we'll be prompted
with a series of questions we are going
to be using iOS and we are going to be
using androids and I'm going to say no
for most of the other questions let's
save the selected configuration by
typing yes and you should if you want to
use the other things in your application
simply say yes or no depending on the
question but it's not really that
important if you do say yes and all at
this point because you can't
change this in the future the next stage
is the head over to the firebase
dashboard and this can be done by going
to firebase google.com and hit sync or
the console here at the top now you will
need to be logged in with an appropriate
Google account so hit call the console
and then when we log into this firebase
dashboard we can hit add project we can
fill in a project name such as native
script firebase and we can also select
the country / region after this you can
then hit create project to continue so
at this point we need to hit add
firebase to your iOS app and add fibers
to your Android app let's now hit add 5s
to your iOS app and fill in the bundle
ID that we created earlier if you
remember this was I Oh dot Paul holiday
dot NS fire you can give this a nickname
inside of the dashboards and if you have
an app store ID you can add that
otherwise hit register app and while our
four steps at the top here the second
step is all we need we just need this
Google service in Ford dot P list so I
want you to download this file by
clicking on this button and at this
point after that you can either hit the
X or just to click continue twice
afterwards our view should change and
now we should see our iOS application
here I then want to hit add another app
but this time I want to add the Android
application
we'll follow through with the same
process by adding our package name and
hitting register app and then after that
we'll download the configuration file
once again so hit download Google
services don't JSON and then hit
continue we don't really need to do
anything with this last step because the
plug-in handles all that for us so now
hit finish now that we have both of
these files and we'll set up firebase
over on the dashboard we can go back to
our application so inside of the
terminal I'm going to run cord dot to
open this up inside a visual studio
chord and I'm going to open up the app
folder
which then contains this app resources
for Android and iOS and want to
right-click and reveal and find them and
I'm going to drag the Google services GS
on over to the Android folder and then
I'm going to drag the Google service
info.plist over to the iOS folder so if
we look back inside of our project we
shouldn't have this Google services JSON
under Android and the Google service
info.plist under the iOS folder we can
now close these folders up and hand over
to our app module now there are many
ways in which we could bootstrap our
firebase application we could do it
inside of mint or TS we could even do it
sidewalk out components if we want but
for now I'm simply going to put this
inside of our app module will import 5s
and that will be equal to e require for
the native scripts for again firebase
once we have that we can run firebase
dot and net and Phi based on in it does
take a configuration option for now we
won't concern ourselves with that we'll
be looking at that in other lectures and
then we can say then we know that if it
did initialize with alt Inara we have
firebase initialized but we know that if
there was an error we can log out error
and then pass through that era at this
stage we can then run the application so
if I open up my terminal or if I even
use the visual studio code plug-in for
native skrutz we can then run TNS and
run iOS and I'll just run this on iOS
for now but it will be the same for
Androids now when you do run TNS run iOS
it may take a little time because it
will need to install all of the
dependencies and another thing you can
only run this on a Mac so if you're on
Windows then I'd run TNS run Android to
check the status of the app if your
application has booted up and we do see
up at the top that probably means that
we haven't got an era but what we can
then do is check out our terminal and
our terminal shuts there at some point
firebase initialized and that means that
we've done everything correctly if we
have this console dot log inside of the
terminal at this point we can't see that
we have initialized firebase correctly
so if you would like to see more
firebase content let me know inside of
the comment section below I can add some
more content for potentially
authentication database calls that type
of thing within their descriptor that
would be awesome aside from that I do
have some angular courses and ionic
courses over app all halliday don't I or
I do have isolate you check that out and
more recently I do actually have a
subscription plan and that does allow
you to subscribe and get all of the
courses and future courses for one easy
price per month</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
