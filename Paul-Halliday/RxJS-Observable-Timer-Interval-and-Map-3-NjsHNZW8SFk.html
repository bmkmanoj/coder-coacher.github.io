video in the series of our XJS today
we're gonna look at both the interval
and timer as well as the map operator
let's create a new observable by using
let my observable is equal to and we'll
say our X dot observable and we'll use
the interval function the interval takes
a parameter and that parameter is the
time in milliseconds so if we say a
thousand this means this observable is
gonna do something every one a second if
we then take our observable so my
observable dot subscribe and we'll say X
and we'll consult or log the x value if
we've run that we then get 0 1 2 and so
on but notice that the values come in
every second if we change that to
hundreds we can see the values coming in
every 100 milliseconds let's change of
Max or a thousand so we can read up
another thing we can do is use what's
known as the timer so the timer in rxjs
can actually create a delay before we
start the observable so we can create a
delay of 2 seconds and then every 1
second we can log out the number so if
we clear this and run again we have it
delay of 2 seconds and then every 1
second we're logging out the number
we're going to look at map in its own
video but right now we can use dot map
and we can take the value of the
observable
which we're going to call X and we're
simply going to return x times three so
that will take the value of one then
make it three six nine and so on let's
clear the console and run it again
similar we have the two-second delay
then instead of one we get three then
six then nine then twelve and the list
goes on that runs every one second after
having a two-second delay so in this
video we've looked at interval and timer
within rxjs we've also looked at running
a function on the value that has
returned from the timer or interval and
in this scenario was simply timesing it
by three and then of course we're
subscribing to the observable and
logging out to the console if you want
to see more rxjs videos check out the
playlist and of course leave a comment
in the comment section below my name is
Paul and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
