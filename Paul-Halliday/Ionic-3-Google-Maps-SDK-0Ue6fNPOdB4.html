Google Maps video by the end of this
video we will have made this simple
application that shows a Google map on
screen and of course also displays a
marker at a particular location let's
dive in and get started so our journey
starts off at the Google Maps API is
documentation and where we need to go is
the Google Maps JavaScript API let's
select that and then we can hit get a
key when we have again a key button
we'll be able to enable the Google Maps
API for one of our Google projects and
then get an API key which we can use
inside of our app once you have that key
keep it somewhere safe as we'll need it
in a second when we come to include the
Google Maps SDK so let's start off by
generating a project with the ionic CLI
such as ionic start ionic Maps and we'll
use the blank template that simply
creates a new ionic project based on the
blank template named ionic maps now
notice at this point in time we're not
using the Cordova plug-in for the Google
Maps API
we totally kurds if we wanted to but at
this point we're looking at the
JavaScript SDK one that has all finished
we can CD into ionic hit - Maps and then
of course we can open this up using
either ionic serve or ionic lab I like
to use ionic lab so let's go with ionic
lab so as you can see we now have our
application here on the right and our
chord here on the left so let's head
over to indexed or HTML and that's
inside of our source directory and then
index dot HTML and then going to add the
Google Maps SDK to our project so let's
add a new script and this will have the
source of the Maps Google API so calm
slash Maps API and then we also want to
do /gs and we need now a question mark
after at this point we need to pass in
our key equals to and then whatever your
API key is
then the API key that we copied earlier
on at the same time we also need to add
a sync and defer to the script and once
that is done we can then continue
developing our app because we now have
the Google Maps SDK inside of our app
let's now head over to our home the HTML
and one going to him has changed the
title to Google Maps I'm going to give
this a color of primary and will change
the content to get rid of the padding
and also add a div we'll give this the
ID of map and we'll also give this a
template reference of hash map and that
simply allows us to access this Dom node
inside of our typescript using the view
child decorator we'll take a look at
that in a second so now we can head over
to our home TS and here we can import
the view child and the element reference
so the first thing we'll do is capture a
reference to that div that we just made
and remember we give this the template
reference variable of map so we'll call
this the map reference and that is of
course of type element reference so just
a chant that we have everything working
when the view has loaded we will console
dot log this dot map ref and that will
just tell us whether we have access to
that div so we can open up at the
developer console and we should now see
this element reference which has a
native element and that native elements
is the div with the reference ID here of
a map also and this is where we're going
to bootstrap the Google Maps SDK into so
we're going to put our map inside of
this div so that's what we'll be doing
next and that's gonna be done with a
function that we're gonna call Shore map
show map it needs to have a location so
let's create ourselves a location
this has to be lat and long so that can
be equal to in new Google Maps dot lot
long and then we need to pass in a
particular
and long once I've done that you'll
notice that we have this red underline
for Google it's effectively saying that
we don't have any types here for this
Google what we need to do is outside of
all components in our class we need to
say declare bar Google have typed Eddie
this will stop typescript from
complaining and we no longer have that
error so once we save this we now have a
reference to this location and the next
thing to do is to set up some map
options so let's make in options and
then we can divide the center so this is
where our viewport is going to be and
that's gonna be our location we can then
do things like alter the zoom level if
we did something like 10 and once we've
defined our location and we've also
defined our options we now need to
actually put the map on screen so we
need a global reference as far as our
homepage is concerned to the reference
of our map so let's put map equal to any
and we can say that this dot map is
equal to a new Google Maps dot map this
is a capital M we need to pass in the
map reference and then we need the
native element of that map reference and
any options so that's the options we
just created with the center and the
zoom level let's save the file and see
what happens so far nothing and that's
because we need to add this dot show map
into our ion viewdidload this
essentially means that when the home
page has loaded our map assured display
on screen so if we save our file we see
that nothing actually appears on screen
at this moment in time and that's
because we need to define a width and
height for our home page so if we head
over to home
don't SCSS we can then give our map a
height of a hundred percent and once we
do that we now have a map on screen and
it's
pointed at our location here at London
so if we wanted to we could drag the
street v1 and we could start looking at
Street View but what I also want to do
is add a marker and I'm gonna add a
marker at our location where we start
the map
so let's make a new function named add
marker and our add marker function will
take a position and it will also take
the map it will simply return and new
Google Maps don't marker that's a
particular position on a particular map
so then whenever we want to all we need
to do is pass in at the reference to our
map as well as a reference to a la
longue and we should be able to display
a marker so if we said this don't add
marker inside of our map function we get
out of marker at the location in which
we set the viewport for our map and also
we can pass in this Dom map arguably at
this point we could just leave our map
equal to a constant inside of this
function and get rid of our global map
variable so we don't have to use this
dot map anywhere but we may need it
outside of this function in the future
depends on how we want to structure our
component if we save the file we should
now see a marker on-screen and we
certainly do and that's at the viewports
of our map so we can change things like
the zoom if we said soon xx would zoom
further in on our map we could also
change things like disable the street
view control so we could make that equal
to false and you'll notice now that we
can no longer use Street View
when this refreshes there's also a
variety of different map type IDs that
we can use so if we had map type ID and
we tried road map I'm also going to
change the zoom to be 15 you could see
that this is the default version so we
have now a road map but we could use
things like a satellite
and that would give us a satellite view
of the particular location or we could
zoom in once again we have things like
hybrids and that gives us a hybrid view
of the normal and satellite view as well
as terrain and terrain simply allows us
to see the physical map based on the
terrain information we can also change
this dynamically so for example if we
had a set time outs we could then use
map a dot set map type ID and we could
set this to simply be a satellite after
three seconds so here we have a standard
map based on the terrain but after three
seconds were changing that to be a
satellite map so we've looked at how we
can change some different Maps we've
also looked at after three seconds how
we could change something we could
change them out type ID to instead be
something like sunlight we've looked at
adding different markers so that's how
we implement a variety of different
things inside of our ionic application
using the Google Maps SDK the
possibilities are literally endless you
can do so many different combinations of
things and you can tailor it directly to
your application I suggest that you
check out the documentation for the
Google Maps JavaScript API if you'd like
to customize this even further don't
forget there is in knit of plugin for
Google Maps when you're coming to
implement this on your Android and iOS
applications and you should check that
out it's available within ionic native
and you may find that it does increase
performance when compared to the
JavaScript SDK but this is how we do in
JavaScript as well as making quite a few
customizations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
