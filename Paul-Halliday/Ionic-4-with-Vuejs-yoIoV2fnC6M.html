how we can use a very early version of
ionic 4 with view GS so before getting
in Turin I want to install the view CLI
with NPM install view - CLI - G this
will allow us to use view inside of our
command line after which we can make a
new view project using view in it based
on the web pack - simple templates and
I'll be calling this I - view it appears
I should have installed the view CLI
because there is a new version available
but nevermind
we can create the project called I view
we can simply make the description an
ionic and view project the author is me
and of course this moment in time we're
not too concerned about using SAS as you
can see we now have I - view generated
so we can see D into that and then we
can run npm install to install our core
dependencies awesome let's run npm run
dev and at the same time open this up
inside of Visual Studio chords using
chord dot so if you've ever seen a view
GS application before we have a very
standard welcome to your view don't yes
up screen and then of course our
directory structure is very simple we
have an indexed or HTML or web pack
config and everything to do with our app
is inside source the first thing I'm
going to do is include ionic core now
like I said this is a very early version
so expect a lot to change as time goes
on underneath to our build script I'm
going to import from unpackage comm
slash at ionic and I want call at 0.02 -
20 and then we want dist
ionic dot GS that gives us access to
ionic core like I said it's very early
but we can use a lot of the common web
components now if you're asking yourself
at this point what
is ionic 4 and ionic core well it's all
built on stencil stencil is a web
component compiler that makes vanilla
web components and libraries like ionic
especially as this is built by the ionic
framework team they can take ionic and
make it not linked to angular so it will
still work with angular but we can use
it in other frameworks such as view so
we've added ionic core to our project
the first thing I want to do is head
over to after you and I'm gonna get rid
of everything inside of our div ID is
equal to AB and inside of I on up I want
to make an I on page and in here we can
define a header like usual so if you've
ever used ionic before you'll know that
we can define a header and a toolbar
inside of the toolbar and simply going
to say ionic view and if we save the
file and take a like in our application
let's remove all of the styling you'll
notice that we start getting these
errors in the console on that saying
that this is an unknown custom element
so we have to tell view that we want to
use these web components inside of our
application and that can be done over in
our main dot J's file so we need to save
you Duncan fake and we want to use the
ignored elements array and we want to
pass in ion - app ion - page do the same
for header and the toolbar let's save
our file and our config will update and
will no longer have these errors the
next thing I want to do is go back to
indexed or HTML and I also want to add a
meta tag that allows us to basically
skill the viewport to the device width
you'll see this in a lot of HTML
templates and essentially this just
allows us to responsively size our
elements
the final thing we need to do is give
our ion page the class of Shore - page
when we do that our page should appear
here on screen and as you can see we
then have ionic view but it looks a bit
strange this isn't the title element
that we come to expect when developing
ionic applications and that's because we
need to wrap this in an ion - title so
at this point in time we've wrapped in
an ion title but there's something else
we need to do because we're using a new
web component we have to go back to
albinius and add it to the ignored
elements now Wave view is not gonna
think that this is a view component it's
gonna recognize them as a web component
and it's gonna appear on screen so
what's next let's display an eye on
content inside of our eye on page will
then take a list we'll get some
information from a server and we'll
display this list on screen before
getting too far into this I want to
install axials so let's run npm install
Axios and this allows us to get some
data from a REST API so inside of our
app top view let's scroll down to our
script and we can import acts yours from
Axios and then inside of our created
lifecycle I want to run Axios get and
then we can classify the URL as HTTP
JSON placeholder dot Tai packard.com
slash users this is a standard test REST
API and it gives us some data that we
can display on screen without any setup
we can then hug again see the dot then
event get the response and assign the
response to this dot users
so we can say this the users is equal to
response don't data let's add it uses
array into our dinner like so and now we
should then be able to display these
users on screen with v4 so back up to
our template inside of our ion content
let's make an ion list that list will
have an item and a label will run v4 and
we'll say user users so that will be the
list of users that we get from our API
and we can bind the key to the user Don
ID awesome so now we can iterate over
this list of users we can bind to the
user name so we'll display the users and
name on screen and we want to ear full
label so let's add be full attributes
and you'll notice as soon as we save
this file we get our list on screen we
also will get some errors when we
refresh so let's go through and add the
different elements so these elements are
things like ion - content ion - list ion
- item and ion - level when we save the
file and we refresh we should have no
errors in the console but we have an
application that uses ionic web
components fill with stencil inside of
our view application what a time to be
alive we can also at the same time
change this to be iPhone 6 plus and we
get the same iOS view that we've come to
expect with our ionic applications so I
hope you can see the power of this it's
not limited to view we could have done
this in straight JavaScript we can do it
in react we can do in angular 1 so many
different use cases but we have the same
power or we'll have the same power when
ionic 4 is released without the
overheads are being tied to angular
because you've got to under
stand while angela is a great framework
and I use it every day the success of
the ionic framework project will be so
limited to the success of angular and I
do believe that Angela is honestly as
popular as it is because of ionic to a
certain degree but when I'm using view
are working with a team that doesn't
want to use angular but also wants to
target mobile I can see ionic form the
web components being a great component
to that are you excited for ionic 4 and
the implications of being able to use
this inside of you react and much more
