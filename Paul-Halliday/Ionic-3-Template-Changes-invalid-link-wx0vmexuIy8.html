the difference in project template
generation in the latest ionic framework
versions so currently ionic app scripts
has been changed to generate a page
without in module so for example if we
head up into our terminal and we select
the ionic generates page and we can see
hello world we can see of course that we
have generated a page named hello world
if we take a look at how about page
unlocks it contains a component is style
sheet and air template view in Prior
versions it did also contain the ionic
page decorator and a feature module so
let's quickly have a look at how we can
navigate to this page and then it will
make ourselves a feature module and also
look how we can navigate to this using
lazy loading so if we're on the home
page and we of course make ourselves a
button with a click event of navigates
megha function and navigates and said
this dot nav control dot push and if
we're using lazy loading we can of
course use a string but otherwise when
we're not using lazy loading we have to
import the page so let's import my page
by seeing imports from hello world with
the page of hello world as a result we
can use nav control push to navigate to
that page so we can see it navigates to
hello world page without lazy loading so
the final thing to do now obviously
navigates into this page we need to
include this in our route app module so
in order to import this we can say
import from pages hello world hello
world and we want to import the hello
world page and add this to the
declarations and also the entry
components so the entry components
whenever we have a page ie not a
specific component it should be added to
the entry component array as a result
we're adding the hello world page into
that array and if we select it navigates
we are navigated to our hello world page
as expected but if we comment this out
and I'm also going to comment out the
import here and we say it navigates to
the hello world page with lazy loading
and we try this not nav control dot push
and pass in hello world page inside of a
string you'll notice that when we still
like to navigate we do get this invalid
link for the hello world page
so let's see how we can fix this all I
need to do is add the ioniq page
decorator into our hello world page and
to use ionic page we need to import that
from ionic angular and we also need to
generate a feature module so let's say
hello world module ts so let's start off
by importing from angular core we need
to import ng module we can then use the
ng module decorator to construct a
module and also export a class named the
hello world module our module will
import the ionic page module and the
ionic page module comes from ionic
angular inside of this we can save for
child so essentially providing this page
to the ionic page module and the page
that we are referencing is of course
hello world
can import our hello world page from the
hello world file and we can pass this
through our imports we also need to
declare the fact that this module
contains the hello world page so add
this to the list of declarations and now
we have the ability to lazy load this
module so if we navigate back to home
dot es we are providing the name of our
page as a string and to make sure it's
not been loaded in our route app module
we can head over to our app module ES
and we can comment out the hello world
page both from the declarations and the
entry components as well as our imports
at the top here so if we select navigate
once again you'll find that we are
navigated to the hello world page and
this is verified correctly inside of the
navigation bar when we head up ionic
served we can see that our nav bar
correctly notices that we are lazy
loading and of course now we have URL
deep links so you will now find that the
standard generation template does no
longer include a feature module so it's
entirely up to you whether you want to
use lazy loading inside of your
application if you do and of course now
you have to generate your own module and
if you don't you can always simply
import the page and use it without
quotation
so this has been a review of the
template changes and also at the same
time we've looked at how we can navigate
to air route both implicitly
and with our lazy loading techniques so
if you're getting any sort of error this
is most likely why so I suggest that you
review the techniques that we've looked
at inside of this video and adapt your
project accordingly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
