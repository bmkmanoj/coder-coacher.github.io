making it text-to-speech application
with native script and angular so let's
make a new native script out by running
TNS creates NS - TTS and that's the name
of the project I'll be using the
template using the template flag of - -
templates native script - templates ng -
tutorial this makes a blank native
script application using angular we can
then change directory into our TTS
folder and then we can add the plugin
sort of TNS a plugin adds native script
- text-to-speech when that is finished
I'm going to open up in Visual Studio
cords to get started there are a couple
of things we need to do in app from
module TS and the first one is to import
from native script - text-to-speech
we'll need to import the TNS
text-to-speech we can then add that to
the list of providers within our ng
module by saying the TNS text-to-speech
and because we'll also be using ng model
we'll need to import the native script
forms module and that's from a native
script - angular / forms so we can add
native script forms module to the list
of imports that's everything we need to
do inside of our app module ts
we can then start making our
applications or imports from native
script - text-to-speech once again and
this time on the dns text-to-speech will
also need the speak options in the ves
now we can make our user interface so
we'll need something call this stacked
layout
the stunt layout allows us to put our
text field and button on top of one and
other
so for that we'll need a text field
and the text field will have the
ng-model attached and that will be text
to sear so this means that anytime we
type in the text field it will be mapped
to the text to see it variable inside of
our components using ng model now you
can't use ng model in the native script
application without importing the native
script forms module so ensure you've
done at that will also need a button and
the text of all button will say speak
text and that's going to be referring to
the text field which will be above the
button and when the user taps the button
we'll call this a text function so let's
implement this logic inside of our app
component the first thing we'll need is
a text to see and that's gonna be of
type string and that's what we're gonna
add to our model here next we'll need to
make a TTS options and that'll be if
types speak options
then inside of all constructor we can
inject TNS text-to-speech so privates
TTS of type 10s text-to-speech if we
therefore write our say text function
we can say this door TTS speak now speak
initiates the text-to-speech a service
and what it does as it speaks anything
inside of what we pass in
now we pass in something called speak
options so let's take a look at that
interface these speak options includes
any text that we want to speak as well
as a variety of other config method such
as volume speak Reds and so on and we
also get access to this finished
callback function so let's implement
these speak options we can say this door
TTS options is equal to and for the text
will say this dot text to Sam
we could alternatively if we didn't want
to add anything to the model we could
say a particular string here like hello
world but as we'll be getting our text
from the text field within the UI we're
gonna say this dot text to say and I'm
happy with the defaults for everything
else within these speak options but
we'll also implement a finished callback
so for the finished callback will have
any data that is associated with the
callback and we'll simply log out the
dinner as well as console that log I'm
finished so the next thing to do is pass
our this door TTS options to our speak
function we have a variety of other
methods we could use on text-to-speech
if we said this door TTS it dot we can
see we have things like pause which it
pauses of the current text-to-speech and
we also have things like resume if you
wanted to resume the text-to-speech and
destroy
this story should be used if we are
navigating away from the page or
alternatively no longer need to use the
text-to-speech module this ensures that
were not having any sort of memory leaks
or allocate and system resources that we
don't need to use I'm relatively happy
with this so let's run this on the
device
to run this on the device I'm gonna say
a TNS run Android and this will install
the Android platform as well as making
the FAQ and putting it on the device so
as I'm running this on the device are
not the emulator you can't currently see
the screen but I'm gonna say subscribe
for more need of scripts videos
and then if we click speak text we get
just close enough we can also see we got
I'm finished inside of all console here
as well as undefined as there's no data
to pass through in the finished callback
so we can remove data and simply save
the file so as our new application has
just said if you'd like to see more knit
a script videos then of course hit that
subscribe button and let me know in the
comment section below
I'm having a lot of fun with native
script it means I can use a lot of the
concepts that we know within ionic and
angular but instead to make native
applications don't forget the learn
ionic 3 from scratch course has now been
released you can check the description
for a link and this can't cord to that
but until an my name is Paul Halliday
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
