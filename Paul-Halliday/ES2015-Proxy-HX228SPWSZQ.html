the proxy object inside of JavaScript
this allows us to define custom behavior
for common operations such as property
lockup assignment function invocation
and much more the use case can be
everything from simple validation to
more complex operations let's first have
a look at what a proxy is and how we can
use it inside of our projects so the
first thing we'll do is to create a
proxy and what we want to do is display
an error message whenever an object does
not have is specified key so in order to
do that we have to define a handler
function so let's define a Const handler
and that can be equal to a new object
and essentially what we're doing is
overriding the get for that object so
let's make ourselves a get function and
inside of here we have a target and name
the target is our object so for example
if we had a person and we have the
following key such as edge name and
location perhaps if we wanted to display
an error message when the email address
is not present on my key in this
circumstance
the target is the person object the name
is the name of the object key so that
would be the location the name the edge
and so on so essentially what we want to
do is only return if the name exists
inside of the target and then we can
have a ternary operator here and we can
say that if it does exist we want to
return the target and beam them but if
it does not exist then instead we want
to return not found and when we return
and not found that essentially means
anything that doesn't exist we can
return a default value so now that we
have our function that overwrites the
standard gap methods let's create a new
proxy so let's make a Const proxy is
equal to in new proxy and at this point
in time we have to create a proxy with
air handler and also a target so we can
start off by supplying air target and
I'm simply going to display a empty
JavaScript object the handler that we're
going to use will be the handler that
we've just created and now if we simply
say proxy dot M is equal to hello and we
were to console dot log that we would
see hello and that's because the name
object exists on our proxy because after
all it was initialized as an empty
JavaScript object we've then added the
name key and value to this but we
haven't added an edge so if we said
proxy dot edge we will get not found so
that's how we can overwrite the property
lock up and as a result here we can then
display an error message if it doesn't
exist on that object perhaps if we were
to make a new object such as person and
that person object was to have a name of
Paul and an age of 25 we could
said pass through the person object
instead of the empty JavaScript object
so let's pass through a person and
you'll notice that we now get proxy door
edge equal to 25 and we get that logged
out on the console but if we did proxy
location it would of course be not found
so that's a basic example of how we'd
get started with a Gantt handler within
our proxies let's take a look now with
how we can validate this information
perhaps if we want to determine that our
proxy dot location has to be yes Turing
and for example it can't be in number we
then want to display an or a message so
for now let's comment all of this out
and we can start off by defining a
validator so let's make it constant
validator and that can be a new object
similar to our Handler and this time
instead of against you can most likely
imagine that now we're looking at the
set operation so the sensor operation
takes an object of property and if value
in certain circumstances we can also add
a receiver here but will not be covering
this inside of this video so one was
setting a property we want to return a
boolean value otherwise if the property
is not as we expect then we should throw
an error so let's start off by saying if
the property I'm going to make these
fully typed is equal to location and as
well as that if it is a number that
we're trying to set for this property
and key and that can be found within the
value parameter then we'd like to throw
in new error and I'm simply going to say
that the property location
must be a strength
as Miss circumstance were overriding the
set method we need to define the default
value of what would usually happen when
we go to set our object so we want to
say that the object property is equal to
the value and that's essentially sin
that our person dot location is equal to
for example if we said England then it
will be equal to England then each time
we're using the set Humber we need to
return ear boolean so let's return it
true and this simply lets us know that
of course we have a correctly set the
new value so let's now try out our
validator let's make in new proxy with a
empty javascript object and our
validator as the handler we can then set
person dole occasion and we'll make that
equal to the United Kingdom notice that
we don't get any error on screen at the
moment but if we were to change this to
instead to be 1 we now get the property
location must be err string if we change
this back to England or another country
such as Sweden you'll see that we don't
get an error and if we were to log this
out to the console we'd get the
appropriate value we can check that by
saying console dot log person dot
location and you'll see that we get
Sweden so this is an example of how we
can start looking at proxy inside of our
JavaScript projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
