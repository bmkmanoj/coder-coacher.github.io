be showing you how we can use
observables from rxjs within our
applications so if you haven't seen
observables or used observables in the
past they are quite similar to promises
but they allow us to get multiple values
back and of course they can run
synchronously or asynchronously so let's
first off start by importing observable
from rxjs slash observable and make sure
you've got our XJS within your project
we can then make a new observable by
saying let my observable is equal to our
X dot observable dot create so creating
an observable then inside of our create
function we have access to an observer
and this observer can pass values down
the data stream so if we wanted to in
our observable past the numbers one two
and three we could use observer dot next
and when we use dot next anything that's
subscribed to the observable will get
values that come from the dot next so we
can start off by passing one and we'll
take a look at what this looks like
inside of our console sort of subscribe
to that value of one
we can use my observable dot subscribe
and then we can take whatever is in the
data stream and console don't log the
data so if we run this we get one we
could then pass observer dot next to and
run this again and then we get one and
two but I mentioned that it's more like
a stream than a promise or promise what
usually happens is we ask for some sort
of data and then we get the data in the
then call observables we can get data
asynchronously but they can come at
different times so while one and two
might be synchronous so when we ask for
the values they are instantly given we
can make a timeout function
and within that the timeout function we
can say observer dot next three and
we'll make this two seconds so after two
seconds we'll send the three down the
data stream so one and two and then
finally we get the three so the great
thing about using observables is that we
don't have to make any assumptions about
when the data is gonna come down at the
stream we can subscribe to the events
and any data that's passed down the
stream via observer next we can get
whenever they arrive so there we are
creating our first observable with rxjs
and subscribing to the data stream we've
also looked at how we pass things down
the stream with observer dot next and
we've also looked at doing it
asynchronously by using the set timeout
function now the set timeout in this
instance is just replicating what it's
like to go and get data from a server in
the real world you might have a variety
of other is synchronous functions that
you might want to run but you can see
how we can pass that value when we get
it down the observable stream so I hope
this helped done you now have a greater
understanding of observables within rxjs
my name is Paul Halliday and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
