test our few zaps that we write on the
desktop on our mobile device this means
we can run our iOS and our Android apps
inside of this filles preview app now we
can download from the App Store as you
can see I've already downloaded the
filles preview here on my iPhone 10 I'm
gonna hit open and we're greeted with
this screen that allows us to either
scan a QR code or set up our project
manually I've now opened up a fuse
project inside of my Mac and then going
to hit the device's button at the top
right and notice how we have a QR code
or an IP address here let's head scan QR
code on a device and scan the QR code
from inside of the application at this
point you'll be able to see the results
of your fuser application as you change
it in real time on the device
now that we've paired our device with
the fuse application we can see the
results of any changes in real time
notice how when I change the opacity
this is instantly reflected on the
device itself I can change the color of
the rectangle to be anything and it's
instantly also updated on-screen on the
device one of the benefits of over
testing on the device using the preview
application is that on Windows when
we're developing fuse applications we
otherwise wouldn't be able to test on
iOS this is now possible because we're
able to connect it's a few studio with
my QR code from inside of the fuse
preview app so go ahead and download the
fuse preview application from the App
Store on your device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
