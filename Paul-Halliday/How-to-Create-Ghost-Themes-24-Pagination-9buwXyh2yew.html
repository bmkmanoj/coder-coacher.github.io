our application as that our pagination
block does not fit in with the rest of
our theme not only is it outside the
bounds of our container but at the same
time it isn't themed the same as our
other elements so let's fix that by
making a new partial we can make a
partial named pagination dot HBS and
what that allows us to do is override
the default behavior for the pagination
template we can then add enough with the
class of pagination and also is medium
this will make us a decent sized
pagination bar in which we can then add
the role of navigation and the Aria
label of pagination you'll notice that
when we refresh our page we'll lose our
bar so we can no longer go back to all
the posts so what we need to do now is
determine whether we can currently go
back if we do have a previous object and
want to make an anchor tag with the
class of pagination next and the hitch
ref will be page underscore URL and then
this is important we need then a space
which says Previn that's for previous
inside of here we can send newer posts
and when we refresh our page notice that
we don't get anything because we're
currently on page one we can't go back
anywhere from page one we can only go
back if we're on page two or above so
next I want to have a span with the
class of pagination link and also is
current because this is displaying while
current page were on so we're going to
say page and then bind to the page
object of pages so when we refresh our
page we then see page 1 of 2
finally we need to do the same now for
next so let's have an if block for next
and inside of here we can add another
anchor tag with the class of pagination
previous the here tref of page URL next
and this time we can set all the posts
and once we do that you can see now that
we have this page one of two and this
older posts button if we select all the
posts it takes us to all the posts
inside of the blog and we can click
newer posts to go back to page one the
final thing I'd like to do is inside of
indexed are handlebars place this
pagination inside of a div with the
class of container if we refresh our
page we now see page one of two here
aligning with the rest of our content
one of the final things we need to do at
this point is now allow our user to
navigate to a particular post we can
then start theming that post page and
start adding some custom CSS and
JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
