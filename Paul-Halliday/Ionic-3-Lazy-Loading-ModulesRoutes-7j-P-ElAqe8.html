introduced something called lazy loading
this is essentially where we bootstrap
our components and pages as we need them
rather than bootstrapping them entirely
on our app module now you don't have to
use lazy loading within your ionic 3
applications but it's a good idea to do
so as it increases performance so let's
have a look at a blank ionic 3
application and see how we can use that
to migrate our current ionic 2 apps to
use Lizzie Lordan to start with I'm
going to CD into my repos directory and
then I'm going to run ionic start lazy
lured blind - - v2 that'll start a new
ionic 3 project based on the blank
templates called lazy lourdes alright
now we can CD in - lazy - lourdes and
then as we're not going to be running it
on any devices I'm simply going to run
ionic serve so if you take a look on
screen you've got a standard ionic
application nothing out of the ordinary
and if we take a look in vs code
everything if he is to be the same our
pages has simply got a page a template
and is style let's generate a new page
so for example let's generate an about
page ionic G page about
we take a look at the about page that
was generated we can see in about da
module
you'll notice that if we look at our
homepage it doesn't contain that about
that module let's first off start by
deleting the homepage and will generate
the homepage again energy page home see
see that we have the whole module now
ionic 3 doesn't seem to ship with lazy
load and as default so you don't have to
use it but it's a good idea so what
exactly do we do to get this working
within our app if we take a look at our
app right now you'll notice that
everything is going crazy so if we head
back over to our app components es so
with a standard ionic application we
have a home page that is passed on to
this root page here and ionic looks at
this and says this is the root page of
the application but now with the lazy
load on we do something different
instead of importing the page itself we
actually just provide the string name
for the page
so we see it root page is a string and
what we want to say is literally just
calm because we regenerated the page and
now it simply says home
so says that but now we see that home
has gotten or exported number an end
home page and now that is the about and
everything move out so we need a fix
valve to tell ionic that this is a page
and we can bootstrap the page for
navigation and rotten we can instead
import the ionic page module instead of
the ionic module and we can say ionic
page module and simply pass down at the
home a page which is here and we can do
the same in our a bulk component and if
we save both of the files we're no
longer declaring our pages at runtime
and side of the module instead we're
loading them only when it's necessary so
we can remove this home page from the
imports and we can take it outside of
the declarations and entry components so
if we save that we find out that it
should now run in a house so the home
page is being loaded but the about page
has yet to be loaded so then navigate to
a different page we can go back into our
home dot HTML and let's make a button so
the button is going to have a click
event that simply says navigates to a
bold page and the text will simply say
navigates and inside of our home TS we
can make the function navigates to a
bowel page and if you remember what we
did inside of our app component is
instead of importing the page we simply
give is string for the name of the page
so that's what we're going to do here
this got nav control which is important
here inside of all constructor dot push
and then at the name of the page so in
this instance the page is called about
and we can verify that inside of our
bolt of TS here and when we said this we
have a button on the home page which
there's navigates we quicker and it
loads the above page to prove that this
work so we can simply say something in
the about page like h1 hello
about and when we select navigates we
can now see hello about so let's do a
little recap instead of putting our
pages in our declarations and
three components we can now if we want
to which is a good idea to do so make em
module that contains the ionic page
module and then pass of the page inside
the for child method and this it can be
lazy loaded by other pages for example
if we look inside of a home dot PS we
are lazy loading the about page when we
click the navigate to the about page
button this means we no longer have to
import from pages slash your bowel slash
your bowel and we don't have to pass the
reference to the components inside of
the nav controller now we can do
everything
Leslie by not importing anything at all
so providing you have your architecture
up set up properly this should work and
you should find that your performance
goes up so hope this has helped if it
has then hit that subscribe button
because we've got lots more of awesome
ionic 3 content on the way my name is
Paul Halliday and I'll see you in the
