remove an item so inside of our shopping
list service I'm gonna make a new
function and that's going to be called
remove item it's going to take an item
of type item and it will return this
don't shopping list of reference don't
remove and what this actually requires
is the key for the item so let's add the
item key we know that when we select an
item it does have a key element because
we use these snapshot changes so we're
going to pass the item into this remove
item function which is then going to
remove the item from the database so
let's build up our UI first we can head
over to the Edit shopping item door HTML
and on top or below it's up to you I'm
going to add a delete button this is
going to have the color of danger
because it's going to be a red button
and the click event is instead going to
be remove item and once again we're
going to pass through the item into that
function so if we head over to our Edit
shopping items EOS we can make every
move item which takes an item and as you
may expect it's quite simple from here
on out we just have this dot shopping
remove item pass through the item and
then once this has have been removed we
can simply just said this don't toast a
dot sure and we can say that the item
name deleted and perhaps navigate the
user back to the home page so let's try
out our project and let's take the
MacBook Pro and hit delete and then you
can see the bottom here we have this
MacBook Pro has been deleted so we can
go through and we can remove the iPhone
10 plus we can maybe go through add a
new item perhaps you want the iPhone 10
plus bike
so that we have a very basic shopping
list that there's lots of things you
could do to this application to make it
even better
but this application is just looking at
the angularfire database and of course
ionic so I think we've achieved that
we've made a little service here over at
our shopping list service TS that allows
us to get a list of shopping items and
allows us to add shopping items to that
list it allows us to update the item
based on the items key remove the item
here by removing it based on the key and
I think we've also looked at things like
observables and lazy loading our pages I
think we've achieved quite a lot in a
short space of time so I do hope that
you found the series useful if you have
then get in touch because I'd love to
know what you're making and the
applications you've already made</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
