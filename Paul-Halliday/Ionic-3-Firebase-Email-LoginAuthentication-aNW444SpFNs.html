at a firebase authentication to our
ionic applications so we're going to
take this application here which is a
blanket app we're going to add a
firebase registration and then we're
going to add a login button so we're
going to be able to login and register
to alpha visa application backend from
within our ionic app so the first thing
that we need to do is create a firebase
app over at five s google.com simply log
in with your Google account and create a
new project so on this front page click
add project and then give a name for
your project so our project name will be
5 s or we'll click create project and
then we'll be given at the project
dashboards from here we can select
authentication on the top left then we
can hit sign in method and we can enable
this email and password sign in provider
so we can click enable here then I click
Save this will allow us to log in with
an email and passwords into our fibers
the next thing to do is click add five s
to your web app so you then want to copy
the config object and we can add that to
our project we only need the config
option for now so if you simply place
button the file and then insulative our
project I'm going to make a new file
inside of our app directory this file is
going to be called app dot firebase
config dot TS and then we're going to
export a constant named firebase
underscore config equal to that config
option that we copied from alphabet
dashboards so now the key is inside of
this app door 5s config TS we can
install angularfire 2 and we can provide
this conflict to the setup of
angularfire 2 within our module
so the next thing is to install both
firebase and angular fire to to our
project so we need fibers because that's
the key API Xia then angular 5 2 is
simply a wrapper over the firebase SDK
so that we can use firebase inside of
our angular projects in an onion aware
we could use the 5 SSD care and not
angularfire 2 if we wanted to but when
using an your the angular 5 2 SDK is
much easier to work with so install both
of these things with NPM install fibers
and Euler 5 to save that to the project
with - - save and we can continue now
that we have that we can head over to
our imports inside of app module TS and
we can import the angularfire module and
that comes from angularfire 2 so we can
import that from angularfire to the
angularfire module and when we're
importing the angular fire module we
need to hit initialize app and we need
to initialize it with that config so we
need to initialize it with firebase
underscore config and if you remember
that comes from up to five is store
config and that's what we created so
this should now initialize our
application with those config files and
the next thing to do is implement that
authentication feature so we'll correct
the user interface first and then we'll
worry about the imports and business
logic it after that so I'm going to
remove the home page from the project
because I want both a register page in
login page and then if we want to we can
also have a home page but at the moment
we're going to remove that and one
generates a login page with ionic
generates page login we're going to
generate a page named register and then
back inside of our project we'll need to
set our root page equal to the login
page you can remove the import for that
homepage and inside of a login dot HTML
we will make a very simple login page
perhaps we'll have an eye on item with
an iron level inside and an eye on
inputs the iron input will be of type
text but that is by default will have an
NG model equal to use email and that
currently doesn't exist to all have to
create that in a second or do the same
for our passwords although user duck
password the type first time it will be
passwords and the level will the email
address we can make that floating and
this level here can be passwords and we
can also make that floating so I'm going
to quickly make in model
make a folder called models and inside
of all models we'll have a user tour PS
will export an interface of user and
this user interface will have an email
address of type strength and it
passwords of type string then inside of
all login page we can initialize a new
user
so our user object will be user and that
will be an object as the user I'm going
to import user from models slash user
and you can now see that we have a very
basic login form we have an email
address and a password field now we'll
need a button to login and a button to
register so let's add a button to login
the login button here will be an iron
button when we click the button we will
fire a login function we'll also have a
button for register when we click the
button it will fire the register
function this will be quite simple our
login function or it will do for now is
nothing and I'll register function will
not get the user so the register page
and that can be done by simply using
this nav control dot posh and then the
name of the page which is the register
page and we get the nav control from the
nav controller so that allows us to roll
between different pages the login
function all that will of course need to
authenticate with firebase so now we
need to know how do we offer any kids
with fibers let's double check that our
buttons look correct before going any
further and be kind of do it's not
exactly the best form in the world but
it looks good enough so maybe we want
our register button to maybe be a
different color so we can say color
maybe light so something like that if we
then click the register button we are
navigated to the register page so what
I'm going to do for simplicity sake is
take this entire markup so the email
address and the password form
this inside of registered HTML will need
to once again make a user object as
either import the user this time will
only need one button will add the island
button attribute to that and when the
user clicks this button it will of
course via a register function so you
might register function at the moment
will do nothing but will simply
initialize on and now we have to
implement authentication so in order to
implement authentication we need to
implement the angularfire to slash auth
module so that can be angularfire
or 'the module from angular 5 to slash
off if we then add that to the list of
imports
we can then head back over to our
register page and inside of the register
page let's import that and give a fire
off in a production application you've
want to obstruct this to its service but
for now we can just import from
angularfire to slash auth and we will be
importing angularfire or that let's
inject that inside of our constructor
it's private off and give a file
from within at the register function we
can set this door off and I'm going to
rename this to and give a fire off so AF
or just so we don't get mixed up so
we're referencing the angular fire off
here so saying under fire off and then
we're going to say create user with
email and passwords now we need to pass
in a user with an email and password so
I'll register function here needs to
take a user and this user has an email
and it passwords so we can make this an
async function and we can await on this
result and we can make a result object
so we have this result object and that's
the result of creating a user with an
email and passwords and there's the user
email and there's the user passwords we
can try this to make sure that we don't
have any errors if there are any errors
for now we can simply console there are
the error and of course
let's console that logcat the result so
we'll see what the results of creating a
user with this email and password is to
call this function let's pass in our
user object when we're referencing this
register function if we pull off I will
register functional we try and login
let's say something like test a test
comm with the passwords of password so
going to be a capital P and if we click
register we do indeed get our register
result this includes our authentication
token our email address and variety of
other things so we've successfully
registered and we can check this over at
the firebase dashboard
so if we click authentication once again
we now have our test at test calm as
well as a user ID when the user was
created and when the last assigned in we
could also add a user manually by
clicking the add user button and then of
course would be able to log in as my
user when we create the login function
so so far we've created a register
function the user can then at register
let's make a login function now back
over at the login page and the process
is quite similar so we can import from
angularfire to slash auth once again we
can import the angular fire off
we can add this to the constructor by
saying private Air Force and give a
firewall and then inside of all login
function we can serve this airforce dot
or dots sign-in with email and passwords
this can take a user once again and the
user or email
and we can pass the user email and the
user dot passwords this is a promise
once again so we can say async login we
can try to do this if there are any
errors we can catch those errors and we
can say constant result is equal to
trying to login if we are successful in
logging in we will log out that result
so the final thing to do is obviously
pass that log in our user so if we try
and log in at test a test comm with the
passwords of passwords and click login
we do get our authenticated object and
this includes our user ID so now we
might do something like if this was
successful so in so we have a result
maybe dot u ID so now we can say that if
we successfully logged in perhaps we
want to send this user to the home page
so let's now regenerate that home page
by saying ionic generator page home so
we've generated that home page and now
we can see this don't now control the
push home page we can determine that
that the result has to exist before that
so this should now push that user to the
home page when we login let's try this
so if we try again
test a test calm and click login we do
get navigated to the home page but let's
remove that back button by using set
routes and on the home page let's
subscribe to that auth state so we want
to determine whether that person is
actually logged in by the time we get
here if the are we can display a welcome
message so we can import once again from
angularfire to slash auth we can import
the angular fios and you'll know the
drill by now we have to inject that into
our constructors of private Air Force
and yellow fire off and one of you is
about to load we can see this dot F off
daaaad spit and we can subscribe to that
altitudes and for now let's simply
console
log view results so we're not going to
do anything too interesting with it now
but we're simply just going to look for
that results and as you can see on the
home page we do get the result and the
result contains the email so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to import the
tossed controller from ionic angular I'm
going to inject both by saying private
tour spec tossed controller and then
inside of our iron view well Lords when
we get up there to bike I am simply
going to clear this horse to dot create
some is going to create a new toast with
the message of welcome to our pond a
score name so whatever the name of your
application is and I'm going to say dear
dot email the duration of this course
that is going to be three seconds and
we're going to present this to the user
when we get that information so let's
determine whether we have deaded or
email before we try and do that and
perhaps if we don't have dated or email
and we can also say that we have the
dated or UID to determine whether that
person is logged in and we have their
email address we can perhaps give a
different toast that says kids not find
authentication details let's give this a
shot so if we try this out on we log in
as before we do now get welcome to up
named test at test calm but if we try
the same again but this time we're not
logged in and in a production
application you'd obviously want to
implement a guard so this can't be done
anyway but in the sense that the user is
not authenticated we can't try and go to
the home address and we have to quickly
say if data and the rest exists we get
could not find authentication details so
in this video we've implemented a
registration function within our ionic
applications we've also allowed you to
login with those registered details
we've then added a greeting to the user
so when we actually do login or
potentially one we're not logged in we
either greedy user with welcome to our
name always they could not find
authentication details
these are some of the concepts that we
are implementing in the learn ionic
theory from scratch course you can find
that inside of the description below
there's a discount code for that if you
sign up now you can get it at a
discounted read so if you've enjoyed
this then of course hit that subscribe
button if it's helped you inside with
your project as that will allow you to
keep updated with more ionic videos
including firebase and more until on
time my name is Paul thank you very much
for watching and I'll see you very soon
