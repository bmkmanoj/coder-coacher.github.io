today we're gonna like at finding out
the app version of our application to do
that ensure you start in new ionic
application or integrate this with your
current app and then run ionic plugin
adds cordova plug-in version well then
of course need to install the ionic NIT
of module for this plugin so npm install
dash dash's save then at ionic ned of
slash app version I'll also be adding
the Android platform so ionic platform
adds Android I'll then be creating a
live reload server on the device so
ionic run Android - L we can now open
this up in vs code and the first thing
that we have to do is inject the app
version into our app module
so let's import from ionic native app
version we want to import our version
then add that to our providers app
version then I'm gonna do this inside of
my home page so I'm gonna create a few
buttons inside of the template inside
home door HTML the first button will
have the click event yeah it's apnea and
this will simply get the name of the
application and also get out NIMH the
second button will say get package name
the third one will be getting you the
version number and the final button will
be getting the version of court so now
inside of our home BTS we can write
these functions let's start off with get
app name and for this we will need to
import from the ionic native app version
we will need to import the app version
provider and injector inside of our
constructor so I'm going to inject app
version
I'm also gonna be using async and a way
it's here just makes promises a little
bit easier to read so inside of our TS
config I'll be changing
target to es6 and then insulate home TS
will be making the ear sync yet up them
as these things aren't likely to change
during our app lifecycle I'm gonna make
Const apnea is equal to this app don't
get app name ensure that we await that
to resolve the promise and then I'm
going to log this to the console the
next function that we can make is the
ear sync get package name and we can say
Const package name is equal to awaits
this package name so the variable
package name is equal to the resolved
promise of this app get package name we
can then make the get version number so
it sync get version number and we can
say Const version number is equal to the
resort promise of this time don't get
version number and we can log that out
we can also log out the package name and
finally we can make the get version code
so async gets version cords and we can
say Const version cords is equal to the
resolved promise that this dot app don't
get version cords and then we can log
out the version cords to the console
before testing this on the device let's
have a like to see where the app name
the version number the version cords and
everything like that comes from it's
inside of our config dot XML so we can
see our ID is calmed or ionic framework
door up and then some numbers we also
have a version number here of 0.01 so
let's test this on the device to see
what results that we get so I'm gonna
click get up name and we find that the
app name is up so we're setting the name
right here inside of the config dot XML
if we click get package name you can see
conduct ionic framework up which we're
setting in here
if we click get version number we see
that it's 0.01 and if we click get a
version chords which was reflected and
this zero point zero and then one if you
made changes to any of these things we'd
have to reinstall the app on the advice
and then of course click these buttons
again to get the different values I
would advise making it script to
increment the version number every time
you build your application for
production it means that you don't
accidentally forget to upgrade up and
makes it a lot easier for scalability
now if this video helped you and you're
gonna use this within your application
I'd love for you to hit that subscribe
button as it lets me know that you are

to see more don't forget to check out

tutorials and my name's ben paul
