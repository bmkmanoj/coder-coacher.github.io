how we might use multiple environments
inside of our angularfire applications
now what does this mean it means we have
a development environment a production
environments and you may also have
something like s staging environments
but at this moment in time we're just
going to focus on the first two so how
do we get a development firebase
environment and a production environment
well when we build our project with the
angular CLI we have something known as
an environment folder if we take a look
at that we have environments and we have
a production version and a standard
version if we were to select environment
es you would see that we have a
production equal to false and I've added
this new key here which is to do with
firebase and includes your API key your
author domain and so on so simply sap is
standard fibers project and paste in
your information into this environment
file afterwards go ahead and do the same
for your production file so this time it
shuts their production is equal to true
but use a different instance of firebase
now instantly you can see just the power
that we have here we have a development
database that we can use to test and
develop against and a production a
database that we can use to serve out to
our clients and when we're developing
here on our machine we're not tampering
with that data so we've added production
equal to true and of course put in a
separate firebase instance into our
environment dot prod dot t-- s we can
head over to add module don TS and
inside of our module I'm simply going to
import the angularfire module as always
and then I'm gonna initialize the
application with environments don't
firebase notice how I'm simply only
pulling the environments from slash
environments slash environment when we
build our application with the angular
CLI for production it will look for the
production version of this file and what
will happen is it will be initialized
with a completely different database so
for good measure let's test this out
i've also included the angular fired
database module from
angularfire 2 / database and inside of
our app components and simply going to
inject and Gila fire from angularfire
database and then going to specify the
current environment as a firebase object
observable F type string and that
depends on the database that we're
currently in so what I'm gonna do is
specified this top current environment
is equal to the angularfire database
door object and of course access the
environment key that's all we need you
inside of on our component es we can
head over to the HTML file and add a new
paragraph tag inside of that paragraph
tag we can say you are currently running
in and then we can scorp to the current
environment and of course that is a sync
so I'm gonna also gonna add a dollar on
the end of this just for simple naming
conventions and then I'm also gonna
surround this with brackets and said
don't value that will simply give us the
value of the current environment
observable and also add mods onto the
end of that so once we save our file we
should then see you are currently
running in either development or
production mods I'm gonna restart our
project before running this and to do
that we can run ng serve and what this
allows us to do is run our application
in development modes you should then see
you are currently running in development
modes and of course this reflects the
fact that we're running ng serve without
the - - prod flag so let's run our
application again with - - prods if we
run ng serve - prod it will unchanged
and access a different version of our
firebase database a completely different
instance with a different API key and we
should get you are currently running in
production modes so of course this does
extend when you build your application
with the - - prod flag that will ensure
that your application is ready for
production and of course uses the
production environment variables so
that's how we use different environments
inside of our firebase applications
thanks a lot for watching don't forget
to check out Paul Halliday dot IO for
more
and that angular content until next time
I'll see you very soon in that next
