looking at the moon GS router so to get
started I want to make a new project and
I'm going to CD into repos and say make
directory moon GS router if you haven't
seen my introduction to moon GS I'd
definitely check that out on the channel
it's a good overview and I'll position
you very well if you're looking to
create applications with moon so now
that we've made a new directory I want
to make a new indexed or HTML file and
also an app dot J's file after that I'm
going to be running HTTP server on the
directory and also openin this up inside
a visual studio chord as you can see we
are initially greeted with a blank page
and we'll head over to indexed on HTML
when we use Emmet to simply generate a
new HTML file I changed the title to
moon GS router and inside of the body
tag I do on import both moon GS and the
moon router so let's do that by adding a
new script with the source of unpackage
calm and I want to use the development
version of moon
after that we want to import another
script and that will also be a unpackage
calm but this time it will be slash moon
- rata so that will allow us to use the
moon writer inside of our application
the final thing that I want to do is
import another script and that will be
pointing at our app yes just to get
something on screen will also make a div
and the div will have the ID of app and
we can head over to up Jess and simply
make a new moon with the elements of up
and we'll give this it templates of
hello world so here we have a new moon
instance and that does say hello world
on screen the first thing we will be
doing is using moon views and will be
passing through the moon router do be
aware if you are using this in air Nord
environment then you will have to say
Const moon rata is equal to require moon
rata but at this point we are simply
importing it inside of our index dot
HTML so it is in that global scope so we
are now using the moon rock
we can define an errata by saying
constant rata is equal to a new moon
router we can pass through a default
path so we want the default route to be
slash and then we need to define what's
known as the map so the map allows us to
define what routes we want in our
application and then mapping it to a
particular component so if we had slash
and we wanted to point that to the home
component well we'd have to go and make
a component named home and perhaps we
had another route
maybe slash contact and that would also
be the contact component so let's look
at how we can navigate between these two
moon components so before we do anything
we need a new component and that can be
done with moon component we pass through
the name of the component so this would
be home and then we have a new object so
this axe is effectively a new moon
instance anything that can go on the
moon instance itself usually can go on
the component so this means we can have
a template and we will have a div be
sure to not add a new line before you
write anything inside of a template so
don't do this as it will break in moon
so inside of the div will have a h1 and
this will say a home component and then
we'll have something known as a router
link so the router length will be router
- link and what this does is allows us
to effectively handle our routes across
the application so we can add it to our
boots and this will go to slash contact
so we can effectively put some text
inside of our road - link called go to
contact
so we're quite close to being finished
all we need now is a contact component
so I'm going to copy that moon component
for home and want to paste this and
we're gonna make a contact component
this will say contact component inside
the h1 and it will point our user to
slash which will of course be go to home
so we have our two components and these
map the same name that's inside of our
moon router so map here has a slash and
that's our home so we've made both of
our components and now we need to add
the router to our route moon instance so
if we wanted to we could give this a
name such as app and we could pass in at
the router and obviously that router
points to the router that we created up
here so if we wanted to we could simply
just part router like this
and now instead of saying hello world
for our template what I want to do is
instead say it router - view and similar
to other front-end application
frameworks and libraries what this will
do is it will inject the current route
into this tag so when we save our file
and we refresh our page we can see that
we have that home route and that's
because it's getting injected into
router view here we then have the option
to go to the contact route when we go to
the contact route our URL changes to be
slash contact and then it renders this
new component so we are now rendering
the contact component and we have the
ability to go back to the home component
if we select this button but you will
notice that at this point in time we
then get this error inside of the
console
and that's because what's happening is
we no longer have this router view in
existence so we need to take this out
and place it inside of the div inside of
our routes index dot HTML when we save
the file and we refresh our page we can
then call backwards and forwards from
our home and contact so always keep that
router view inside of our routes div
with the ID of app or whatever ID you're
using for your application
so that's how we use the moon GS router
inside of our moon applications I'd love
to know what you think of the C reason
if you want to see more moon apps let me
know inside of the comment section below
