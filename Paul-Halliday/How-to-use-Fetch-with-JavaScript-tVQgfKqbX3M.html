inside of your JavaScript cords you can
use a variety of different options you
can use things like XML HTTP requests
you can use a third-party library and
more recently you can use a fetch so
what exactly is a fetch well to start
with we can provide a link such as the
JSON placeholder API and we'll use slash
or posts for this and this is going to
be the API that you're looking to
interact with and as you can imagine
because fetch is promised best we can
set dot then and will then have access
to the response so we can get the JSON
from the response if we say it rares
don't JSON and that is a function and at
that point we can log out the posts I'm
going to surround this inside of a get
posts function and now whenever we call
get posts it will of course return us a
promise that navigates to our REST API
returns back at be JSON ie B body from
that API and then of course just logs
out to the console at this point so if
we head over to our JavaScript console
now and if we hit that fetch data button
then I've made we can see that when we
call that a function we do of course get
the data we get the body of the post the
ID the title and of course the user ID
for whoever made that post as you can
see if we look in our network tab we can
see exactly when that request was made
as well as the response as we'd expect
so this is obviously a get request we're
not posting anything to the server
we're simply requesting it from the
server we can change the method in which
we can interact with this for example if
we made a new function called new post
and that will take in a post and we
return a new fetch pointing at the same
URL
this time we want to customize that
request but before going much further I
want to navigate over to the Mozilla
developer Network documentation about
using fetch there's a massive a variety
of examples which you can see if you'd
like to really go into depth about how
fetch works and the variety of different
use cases I definitely suggest that
these dogs but for now it would be a
good idea to make some options so the
options will allow us to pass these
options to the fetch call and the method
that we want to use is now post by
default it equals to get so that's what
we don't have to specify it when we
simply want to get the posts for the
body we need to specify a new post so
this is the post that comes in here one
important thing when it comes to the
body is that the body has to be
stratified so let's add json stringify
and we want to string a PHY the new post
next up we're gonna send some headers so
we can say new headers the head is that
we want to use here is the content type
and we're gonna set that to your
application slash JSON so when we come
to using this method here we can replace
that for a variety of other things so
this could be putt this could be delete
but for now we'll keep it at post let's
pass these options to our fetch call so
you'll see now that this fetch has these
options and if we weren't expecting a
response we could convert that to JSON
we could then if we want to do something
at this stage we'll simply log it for
now and if there are any errors we can
catch an error so for now once again
we'll simply set console don't hora will
then sit or our ID logout the IRA to the
console so now the final thing to adding
a new post is of course making that post
a variable so let's make a title all
about fetch
the body of the post is fetch is so cool
and our user ID might be something like
one we can then make a new post passing
in that post and by doing so you can see
that we have indeed made that Network
request so let's run our function and
send that post request to the server you
can see that the post has been made it
has the ID of one zero one because
there's only a hundred posts in the
dataset and any more posts are of course
above that 100 number and if we look at
the exact line of chords we can see that
this was the response after it had been
converted to the JSON body so it wasn't
an error and everything did work as
intended now the same then goes for
modifying something so if we used
something like putz we just changed the
method from post and instead we'd use
putz and finally when it comes to the
delete method we do that once again so
without making this too long of a video
this is the essential use cases for
fetch we want to a poster we want to get
we want to put and of course we want to
delete there are other ways and other
methods in which we can customize fetch
even more and I recommend you check out
the documentation to see how you can do
that and attend next time hit that

more videos and of course let me know
what you'd like to see in the next video

watching see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
