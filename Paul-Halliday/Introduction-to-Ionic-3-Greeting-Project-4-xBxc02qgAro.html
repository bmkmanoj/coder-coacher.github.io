to our pages and then our home dhtml
inside of here we can change the title
of our home page to instead of being
ionic blank we can make it home we can
also add the color attribute to our
navbar
so if we add the color attributes equal
to primary and we take a look inside of
our theme and then variables SCSS you
can see that primary is this blue if we
change this color and still reference to
our variable equal to primary it would
no longer be blue but it will be the
color that you selected you could also
add your own variables here but for now
we'll keep it at primary inside of all
ion content this is where all the
content of our application goes so any
items any inputs any cards anything like
that essentially anything underneath the
navbar goes inside of this ion content
inside of here we can put ourselves an
ion item and that ion item will contain
a label
which we can make floor thing with the
floating attributes and the level will
be nem and we can give the user an input
by default is type text so you don't
have to define that but I'm going to
define that in this instance just to say
that we can actually change this to
something like number if we wanted to
for example take in number input from
the user that would change the keyboard
type so you may have noticed before if
you go to for example send an email you
might get a different keyboards in
comparison to when you make it phone
call so you can see here that our item
is acting as a sort of holder for our
inputs and level to make them appear
together and after that we can make
ourselves a button so the button I'm
going to give the ion button arrow beads
and when we do that it essentially
Styles our button across all the
different platforms so it should be used
each time that you want to use a button
inside of ionic I'm also going to add
the block arrow bits and that makes the
button take up a hundred percent width
of the screen and the Clara beads
essentially gets rid of the background
color of our button and simply leaves us
with the text the text for our button
will be sure greeting and if we take a
look at this now inside of our browser
you can see that we have this input
field that when we select the button
slots and we have a button here with the
text of your greeting our navbar is blue
and it has the text of home let's take a
look now at how we can integrate some
functionality inside of this app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
