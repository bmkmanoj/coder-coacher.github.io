we can log our results out to the
console in a variety of different ways
now most people are familiar with
console log this is essentially how we
log something out to the console so we
could say hello world like that and then
if we check in our JavaScript console we
can see hello world now there are a
variety of other things that we can log
out to the console too for example we
can log an error event console era
this is Nara now when we refresh the
page we can see this is an error and
it's also red we get a stack trace to go
back and see where the potential RA is
so this is really good if we write in
some conditional statements and maybe we
don't want to be getting to this part of
the conditional and we want a display
and era in the console as well as this
we can also use console one this is a
warning and this is like an error but
instead it shows a yellow tint you can
also get a stack trace to see where the
warning was next we have console info
this is an info message and you can see
here that we have an eye next to the
message and finally we also have
something called console dot debug this
is a debug message this acts like the
console dot log but instead the text is
blue so why would you want to use
console dot error or one in four or
debug well one of the primary reasons is
that we can click this filter button
here on Google Chrome and we can filter
out four particular log types so we can
see all the errors we can see the
warnings information logs debug and so
on because of this I would advise you to
start making your applications a little
bit more semantic using things like
errors warnings info in the appropriate
places to make debugging that much
easier if you found this video useful
