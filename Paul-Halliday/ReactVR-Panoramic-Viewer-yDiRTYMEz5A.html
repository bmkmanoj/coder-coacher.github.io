at making our first react virtual
reality application our app is simply
going to view a panoramic image so we're
going to keep it nice and simple but you
will see how to create it up and view it
inside of the browser so let's start off
by running NPM install react - VR - CLI
- G this will install the command-line
interface for the reactive er project we
can then initialize a new reactive VR up
by saying react - VR in it and I'm going
to call my application panoramic this
will make a new project directory and
download the dependencies for our
project as you can see everything has
now been installed and we can see D into
panoramic and then run NPM starts to
initialize our development server if we
then head over to localhost call on it
or it's 1 / VR this as the default ports
we can of course see our application
we're then presented with the word hello
and that we can pan around the room if
we take a look at the code that has been
generated the inside of index dot V r
dot GS we can see that we are importing
react from react so it's a standard
react application and then we have the
reactive VR specific stuff like
panoramic text view up registry and so
on now reactors built on top of three GS
but we can see inside of here we have
our view panel text etc if we change
this text to pork or it word of your
choosing and refresh the page we now get
a different piece of text we get Paul so
it's quite easy to render to the screen
and this is done with this text element
here we could change the background
color of this B font size the font
weight and a variety of other things but
let's remove the text for now and let's
add a different panoramic image the
source of which at the moment is this
assets folder and the chess world dot
jpg
so if we check out our static assets we
have this chess world don't jpg I'm
going to replace this with a different
panoramic image so I'm going to add
instead panel jpg and that's the name of
my panoramic image they've added here
and if we refresh the page we can pan
around the screen and this reflects the
360 degree image viewer on Facebook as
it's the same component that they use so
there we have it we've made our first
react VR application you've also added a
panoramic image and you can pan around
the screen to view your panoramic image
in 360 degrees let me know if you'd like
to see more react via it's definitely an
interesting topic and there's quite a
few things that we could do with this
I'm especially excited because obviously
it's web dev stuff and that means it's
super accessible and we should be able
to do some interesting things with that
as always have that subscribe button if
you'd like to stay updated check out the
learn ionic 3 course got a link to that
in the description and I'll see you very
soon in it the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
