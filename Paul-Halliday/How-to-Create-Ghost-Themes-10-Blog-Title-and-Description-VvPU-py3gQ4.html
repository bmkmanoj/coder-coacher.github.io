title on screen and then we'll logic
reading some posts so if we had a header
and that hannah had a h1 we could use
this interpolation syntax here with two
squiggly braces on each side and then we
put the name of the variable now we have
different contexts inside over cost so a
context gives us access to different
variables at different times so on the
index page we have access to things like
the blog title the blog description the
different posts and so on you can see
the different contexts inside of the
documentation of cost but for now we'll
just bind to the blog title and that's
done with at blog title and we'll have a
h2 for the add blog description if we
refresh our page we now get Paul and the
description of our blog how simple was
that you could imagine we could style
this as much as we want it we could for
example add a background color of
something like aquamarine perhaps we
could then get rid of the standard
margin if we had a style tag okay then
save body margin zero pixels and then
for our h1 we could use
text-align:center as well as our hedge
too so both of these things are centered
we then have a header that has our title
and description not greater and I
definitely wouldn't recommend that you
do this at this point in time but if
just seen how easy is to bind to the
blog title and the blog description
let's remove the styles for now and now
let's also look at how we can bind to
posts so we've seen the blog title we've
seen the description let's see how we
can use the for each operator to iterate
over our posts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
