at adding vibration to our ionic three
applications start off by making a new
ionic up by running ionic starts
vibration blank - - V - when you've done
that we can add the chord or the
vibration plug-in by running ionic
plugin adds cordova
- plugin - of vibration we can also save
this to our config dot XML with - it -
save after that we need to run NPM
install at ionic native Smosh vibration
make sure you save that to the project
as well and hit enter and then going to
add Android as I will be testing this on
an Android device so ionic platform adds
Androids and finally I'm going to run
this on the Android device using ionic
run Android - L this will update any
changes I make on the desktop straight
to the Android device like ionic serve
the first thing that we need to do is go
to source app app module so we need to
import vibration from ionic native slash
vibration and then add vibration to the
list of providers after that we can head
to the home page so home TS and then we
need to import vibration once again and
then injected inside of our constructor
I'm then going to have a simple button
that calls a function called vibrates
and when we click the button we're going
to call this del vibration dot vibrates
and then we want to give a time number
so this is the milliseconds to vibrate
the device but we can also pass in an
array let's start off by using two
thousand so that'll be two seconds of
vibration while we click the button to Y
this up we can make it button so inside
of home dot HTML I'm going to add the
click events vibrates and detects a big
box and we'll say vibrates if we then
check the cell on the device we can see
we have a button which says vibrates I'm
going to click the button
and you can see we get two seconds of
vibration we can make this longer by
saying five seconds as I mentioned
before another thing that we can do is
specify an array for our vibrations so
if we take this and pass through an
array instead we'll start off with a
vibration of one second then after the
one second that's the amount of time we
want to pause for so let's pause for
half a second and then let's live right
again for another second if we run this
on the device we should see vibrates for
a second pauses for half a second and
then vibrates for a second again you can
make this as complex as you want and
that's effectively it for the vibration
plug-in within Cordova and ionic native
if you like this and you're going to use
it within your applications hit that
subscribe button to stay updated with
more ionic three tutorials and until
next time my name is Paul Halliday and
I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
