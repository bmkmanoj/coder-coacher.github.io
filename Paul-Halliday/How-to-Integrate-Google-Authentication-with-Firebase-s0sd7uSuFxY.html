implementing Google authentication
inside of our angular firebase apps so
as you can see here I have a firebase
and angular fire installed inside of the
project I've initialized a new angular
firebase application and I've imported
the angular fire orth module from
angularfire to slash auth so this is the
bare-bones for any sort of
authentication application you'll need
angular fire you'll also need the
angular fire auth module importance
before we dive into this too much I want
to bring your attention to Jeff's
channel angular fire best this is
youtube.com / c / angular fire best and
essentially what Jeff does is he goes
through and shows you how to make a lot
of different 5s applications and
concepts everything from cloud functions
to ng rx and much more back inside of
our application not what I want to do is
of course head over to our app component
don TS so inside of here we want to
import everything to do with the Google
sign-in so that means we need to import
from angularfire to slash auth and we
simply want to angular fire auth and we
also want to import as firebase from
firebase slash app because this is what
we use to generate the different sign-on
types so we can get rid of the title and
we can add a constructor inside of that
construct that we can add a public and
give a fire auth of type angularfire
auth and the reason we're making this
public and not private at this point is
so that we can display the results of
the angularfire auth states on the
template so then as you can probably
imagine we want a login and a logout
function the login function can use this
air fourth dot auth and on this object
we want to use the sign-in with pop-up
as you can see from this pop-up it
requires a provider so that provider can
be a new firebase don't auth dot Google
auth provider and that is a function and
when we call this function what this
will do is fire up a Google
authentication pop-up we'll login with
our accounts and if everything is
correct and of course we have currently
authenticated for our logout button we
can use the air forth and once again we
want the auth object and then here we
can use sign out this can be used across
a variety of different authentication
options so whenever you want to sign out
from your firebase authentication you
can call our function the next thing to
do is head over to our firebase
dashboards from here we can hit the
authentication tab and the sign and
method tab and inside of here enable the
Google authentication methods hit save
and we can then navigate back to our
project inside of the projects app door
component the HTML we can add two click
events one for login and we can also add
another one for logout this gives us the
ability to hit B log in with Google
button once we do that we can select in
authentication methods and I just
selected an account then I signed in
with Google at this point we don't see
anything on screen but if we navigate to
our firebase dashboards we can see that
we have this identifier so this is
provided by Google it was created now
and then we have a user ID so we've
successfully authenticated with our
application using Google so I guess the
next thing we'd like to do is display
that orthis Ted on screen well if we
just come inside of the constructor for
now and said this dot e F or don't or
state we can see that this is in fact
and observable so we can use the async
pipe and display the results of this on
screen so let's then make a div inside
of the div we can only display the login
button whenever the auth state
using the async pipe is true we can use
the async as syntax here to say that
this should be the auth user and inside
of here we can then make h1 and we
combine to the auth user dot display
name underneath I'm going to add a pre
tank and inside of here we'll use the
auth user and we'll paint that to JSON
and if we just make this a little
smaller you can see that we have the
display name here of Paul Halliday but
as well as that we also have a variety
of other things we have things like the
user ID they display an mp4 or URL and
much more so we could get rid of this
for now we can then remove the pre tag
and we can make a new image I'll put
this above the user name and we'll bind
to the auth user don't fort or URL and
as you see here it is quite large but we
do have a thought or as well as a name
so the next thing I guess is to only
display this login button and the logout
button if the user is authenticated well
luckily for us we can take advantage of
the ng if-else syntax and we can display
this logout button inside of this ng F
and alternatively if the author's ur
doesn't exist we can say else login and
we can just wrap this button inside of
an ng template and we can give this a
template literal of login and so that it
doesn't conflict with our function
called login let's actually call this
login template so now you can see we
have our user name we have our photo and
the option to log out let's log out and
when we do log out you can see that we
have the login button once again so
we've looked at a variety of different
things inside of this lecture we've
looked at how to login with firebase
using Google we've also looked at
extracting things from that object as
well as observables and of course ng
templates thanks a lot for watching
