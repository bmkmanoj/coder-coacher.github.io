this course we'll be looking at creating
our own ghost theme by the end of this
course you'll be a ghost theme developer
you'll be able to create themes just
like this with your own personal twist
we have everything from the inclusion of
discuss comments we have the
subscription we have the option for your
readers to subscribe to the blog we have
things like recent posts everything you
would come to expect in is standard
course thing now one of the most
important things that I want to stress
throughout this course is that this is
certainly not the be-all and end-all of
the themes you can create your own theme
you don't even have to follow along with
me you can just follow the same concepts
I'm gonna be teaching you from the very
very beginning stages of handlebars
that's the templating framework that we
use inside of course I'm gonna be
teaching you how you can take advantage
of that to get all the necessary
information from the ghost API for then
you to create anything that you actually
wants you don't have to just be limited
to the theme that you create inside this
course you can go on to sell your themes
on the internet there's lots of
different markets for that you can do
some custom ghost work potentially for
different clients the opportunities are
endless in this course we're going to be
looking at things like web pack we're
gonna be bundling our JavaScript so
that's really important when we come to
actually developing our own themes we
need things to be fast so be using
webpack to bundle our files we also have
a third-party JavaScript carousel here
that's based on something called siema
and the underlying CSS framework that
we'll be using is called bomber if
you've never heard of any of these
dependencies before don't worry about
that we'll be diving in but we'll be
doing it at a slow pace we'll have none
other frell so you won't see a course
here with lots of different slide shows
instead we'll be diving into the chords
and their design and the next few videos
first off Thor will be in
stalling our dependencies will need Nord
jazz for this and currently the Gor see
light needs a particular version so
let's dive into our install and other
penalties and getting started with a
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
