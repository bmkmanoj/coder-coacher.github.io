video we'll be looking at the material
peel 9 theme it's another theme for
visual studio called that I found myself
using recently and it looks very nice on
the eyes so to get started what you need
to do is head off to the extensions tab
here inside of es cords and type in
material theme quite aptly named I'm
sure but as you can see it's a 206,000
download so that's how you know you've
got the correct one and if you then hit
the install button mind says uninstall
because I already actually have it
installed and then what you need to do
after that is hit command P or ctrl P
and I'm gonna type in this look greater
than sign and that allows me to then
select a color theme now I currently
don't have it selected so II then need
to do is go down until you find your new
material theme after which I want you to
take command P again and this time type
in material theme and you should be able
to then edit the settings for the theme
itself now you can either change the
accent color so we have a variety of
different accents so I've selected the
Breaking Bad so that's a green sort of
accent and then we also can change the
color variant so we can have things like
darker and if we just open a file I'm
gonna select one from the angular course
you can see that we have the sort of
interesting theme start up with the
darker setting we can also look at
default default is a little lighter if
you don't like those darker themes then
of course default is a great option we
can also go back and change it this time
to be light now personally I've always
wanted to like a light theme but I just
can't really get away with I don't
really like it that much but you might
it might be perfect for you and your use
kiss but it just doesn't suit me so what
I want to do is take a look at the last
color variant and that's called pale
Knight this is definitely my favorite
one and if we luck if pill night you can
see that it just looks nice on the
screen that the imports are a la but
muted so they're not really standing out
and sort of distracting you from the
cold that you're trying to write
everything just seems to blend in nicely
so I definitely will say I'm a fan of
this theme now it's not my favorite
Visual Studio code name but it is up
there with the top five I think
definitely see myself using this every
dare does offer you a variety of
different contrast levels throughout the
things that you really need to be caring
about inside of your cords so your fan
of the material theme let me know inside
of the comment section below are you
going to use this in your environment
I'd love to hear whether you are or not
don't forget if you want to support the
channel when he can of course over a
patreon.com slash Paul Halliday until
that time hit that subscribe button to
stay updated and I'll see you soon in my
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
