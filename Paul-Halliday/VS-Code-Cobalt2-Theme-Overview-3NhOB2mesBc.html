cobalt tooth theme by West boss so if
you haven't seen West's courses I've
heard them really good so I definitely
suggest you check them out but in this
video we'll be looking at the theme by
Wes himself so this is a theme for
visual studio cords it may exist in
other editors but I really like it it's
one I've been using for a while and I
think it offers a nice amount of
contrast and readability so as you can
see here we have this yellow as a ketone
and we also have these blue accent
colors with this slightly lighter green
blue accent as well we also have a touch
of pink in circumstances like this and
our comments are blue whenever we select
something it's nice and bright and I
think this offers a great contrast
between a dark theme and a light theme
because to me sometimes dark themes are
way too dark and light themes are just
way too light but this offers a nice
middle ground that I do think works in
all a sort of light scenarios whether
it's there whether it's night and at the
same time offers a great deal of
readability so how do we access this
theme and get it set up inside of our
visual studio chords well what we need
to do is hit this extensions button here
and you want to type in cobalt 2 inside
of here we can click the top one which
has 19,000 installs and we can hit the
install button mind says uninstall but
for you and shot say install and then we
want to do after that is hit command P
and I'm gonna put this greater than sign
and that will allow us to then say
preferences color theme and from the
color theme we want to select cobalt 2
once we've done that we should then be
able to use this theme inside of our
project now Wes does that give you some
recommended settings that you might want
to put inside of your vs chord settings
so for example we could copy this we
then be able to head to our chord
preferences settings and we'd want to
paste it inside of the settings here now
I have quite a few but you'd simply just
pop them underneath and we would hit
command V
now there's some extra settings that you
can do with this theme and that's done
with the vs chord custom CSS plugin if
you click this link here inside of the
description you can go along and follow
the installation guide and potentially
you can add the extra stuff inside of
that core ball to custom hacks don't CSS
that will give you just some extra
theming inside of the theme so to wrap
this up outside I'm very impressed with
this theme it's one that I've been
looking for for a while a nice contrast
between light and dark let me know what
you think inside of the comment section
below and whether you're going to use
this theme if not tell me why you're not
using it and the theme that you're
currently using hit not subscribe button
to stay updated don't forget and check
out Paul Halliday don't I offer more
courses and free content until next time
I'll see you very soon in that next
