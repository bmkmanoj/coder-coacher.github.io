is probably easier than you think
but we're going to look at different
things in this video such as the video
tag also going to look at conditionally
changing the orientation of the device
as well as showing things like if
progress bar buttons and more so I'm
going to start off by removing the
status bar because I'd like our video to
not be cluttered up on the screen so I'm
going to add is status bar config is
visible equal to false we could do the
same for Android if we said Android
status bar config is visible also equal
to false so that we hover the state's
one should not be visible on both
platforms now we need to get a video
displaying on screen so to do that we
need a video tank and we can either play
the video from the local file system or
a URL so I'm going to add a URL and then
I'm also going to give a neom to our
video so you X name equal to video and
this allows us to target in the future
and then if we add a button to this and
when the button is clicked we can call
the play trigger we can pass in our
target which is that video and we have
that by seeing you x-men video let's add
some text to that one saying play and as
you can see the video button is actually
underneath of the video so let's align
that to the bottom I'm going to stick it
in a panel for now so if we click play
so our video starts playing when we
actually click that play 1 which is good
now we might need a pause button and to
do this I'm going to instead use a grid
instead of a panel so instead of the
panel we can declare a grid and in a
similar sense we can dock this to the
bottom and within the grid we can do
things like column counts so there's
going to be two columns and only one
rule so we can say raw count 1 and now
it's just a simple
taking our button adding it there and
adding a second button instead called
pause and as we're using adult let's add
this to a doc panel and we now have our
player and pause buttons the click
trigger here should instead be pause so
now if we save the file and click Play
and then click pause all video stops but
if we click play again you can see that
it remains playing from the same
location so so far looks very good we
have a video player which we can play
and of course we can pause what happens
though if we change our viewport and
instead we take this and rotate it to
the right not bad but we have this a
white space which we don't need so let's
get rid of that by saying stretch mods
uniform to fill and if we click play now
all video players as we expect and is
stretched like we expect but what
happens if we put a bank well this
happens and now the video is stretched
entirely but in portrait it doesn't look
very good because we can't actually see
what's happening in the video so now we
have to think about how we can change
this when the device is in portrait mode
and whew seems to have an answer for
everything we can actually use the while
window portraits and while window is
poor rate we can change that stretch
modes so you can set change the video
dot stretch mod equal to something like
a uniform so now if we take a look at
our fuse application and poro mods we
can see the entire video if we were to
rotate the device its changes
appropriately and if we change a bank we
don't have that scaling problem which is
gives the
thing to think about is how might we
determine how much progress there is
left in the video well a fuse once again
allows us to use something called a
progress animation so we can add their
progress animation so this is going to
trigger a change event and what we need
to do is make some sort of rectangle to
display this change event so we could
have a rectangle and I'm going to give
that fill of purple we'll give it a
width of 0% because we want to start at
0% it Heights of above 5 10 or 20 so we
don't a too big and we can choose to
dock this somewhere such as the bottom
we'll also need to give this a name so
that we can change this value so I'm
going to call it progress and we can say
when the progress of the video changes
we can hug into the progress dot with
and give that a value of 100 this will
mean about the progress bar is visible
on screen and will continue to grow as
we watch the video let's take a look at
this so press play and we see the
progress bar continue so there we have
that we have a video player with fuse we
could put the rectangle beetle or the
grid like so and then if we click play
our progress bar appears above our two
buttons there's a variety of ways in
which you can improve this but there
should be a very basic video player
inside of your fuse applications if you
found this useful hit that subscribe
button stay updated with more fuse
contents and until next time my name is
Paul and I'll see you very soon in Italy
