react and if you'd like to get a text
version of this you can check it out
over at alligator dot IO the title of
the article is using a kiosk with a
react so first off I guess when you
define war axes
it's a promise based HTTP request
library which allows us to interface
with REST API so another great thing
about Axios is that we can cancel
request an intercept requests and that
this is something we've seen before on
the channel with HTTP interceptors a
similar thing with angular but in my
opinion I suppose the best thing about
Axios is the easy-to-use API so let's
dive in and our tax EASA to our react
projects the first thing that we need to
do is run npm install
Axios and this will install access to
our project and edit our packaged on
JSON in the later versions of NPM once
we've done that we can head over to our
react project and we can make a new
folder called components if you haven't
made a react project yet
I'd definitely check out the creates
react app repository the component that
we'll be making is a person list this
will simply be a list of people so we'll
start off by exporting a default class
named person list and that will extend
from react don't component in order to
extend from that we'll need to import
react from react and then we can define
some states this state will simply have
a list of persons and that will be in a
ray like so an inside the components did
mount life cycle we can run Axios get
now accion start gets will simply
perform an HTTP GET request on a
particular URL but in order to do that
we need to import
Axios from Axios the RL that will be
getting is simply the JSON placeholder
API so you may have seen this one before
if you have an hour checkout bgs on
placeholder don't type record comm ERL
and as accion's is promised best we want
to use a dot then call take the result
or the response
and I've got to set the states using
sense dance equal to the persons and
that will map to the response dot data
so you'll notice that if we do log the
axial response you'll see that we get a
variety of different pieces of
information bike everything from the
status cord to the headers to the data
and much more but by simply setting the
stats will then have access to this
inside of our render methods so let's
make a random method and we'll return
simply an unordered list that contains
the states of persons mapped to each
individual person which then each
individual person is displayed in a list
item by that person don't name so what
we can do now is head over to our app
yes and its side of up Jess will import
the person list from our components
folder slash a person list we can keep
the welcome to react header but
underneath the header inside the dev I
once then adds the person list component
now if we look at our application we can
see that we do have all of the people so
the ten people appeared on screen using
the Axios and get request if we look
inside of our console we can see that we
have a warning at this point and that's
because we need to give a unique key for
each item so just a for the sake of this
tutorial let's quickly do that and
inside of the list item here we can
assign the key to the person don't ID so
we've managed to now use HTTP GET
request how do we do the other things
such as post and delete well let's make
a new person input yes and inside of
this I'm simply gonna copy the person
list and we'll call us one person in
parts this time the state will be the
person's name and that will not be an
array it will be a string and we don't
need this lifecycle hug at this point
instead what we want to do is handle the
submission of a form so let's make a
handle submit
and that we'll take in the event and to
start with we want to prevent the
default action and we can then make a
new user and that will be based on the
state don't name so that's the stand
that we've selected throughout our text
box which will create soon and then we
want an axial dot poster so very similar
to the get we now have a post and as you
can see here expects a URL and a
potential optional data and config so
let's pass in at the URL once again and
the next thing we want to pass in is the
user and the user is of course the
payload that were passing across to this
API so this would be in your
circumstance any payload that you're
passing to your database or anything
like that that you want to be handled on
the server-side and as always we can
expect to have a response back from
accion so let's have a dot then call and
which will take the response and just
simply log out the response itself and
then we can log out be data that we
might get back from the response we're
nearly there what we need to do now is
change our render method so that we
instead of rendering a list we render a
form let's set the label and the label
will simply say a person in inside the
level will have an inputs with the type
of a text the name of nim and we need a
way to track changes on this input so
what we need to do is make a handle
change function so let's make a handle
change function that takes in the event
from the input text box and we want to
sadly state ie the selected name equal
to the event target don't value so that
will simply be the value of anything we
type inside of the textbox gets added to
the stay parameter here and then what we
submit the text box ie when we click the
Add button in a minute so firstly we're
stopping the browser from reloading the
page we're making a new object and then
we're using Axios to post best our API
and passing along the
jekt as a pair lords let's make an unsub
myths that uses this door handle submit
and for our input we want to use the on
change which will be responsible for
handling the change finally let's add a
button with the type of submit and that
button will simply say add let's take it
over to up yes and inside of here we can
import the person inputs from the
components slash person inputs let's add
that above the list like so here we now
have a taste box and we can add this to
our API so let's add the person called
Roger and hit add if we look inside of
our console you'll see that we've added
a new user named Roger and this of
course proves because we have the ID of
11 that we've added an item to the API
using air post request now when it comes
to making a pot request it's very
similar we'll just use the axial stock
pot and what I want to show instead now
though is the delete so what I wanted to
know is look at how we can delete an
item from our API let's use axial delete
and inside of here we want to pass the
user's / this state
don't ID because we're going to be
passing the ID across to our API so this
means we need to change our state let's
change the state to have an ID we'll set
that initially to just be 0 so we can
collect the button and delete person 0
let's change the person name to be
person ID and the name of which will be
ID the input type you got a number and
instead of odd we want to delete let's
also change this or references the ID
inside of handle change and we can also
remove the payloads ie the new user so
all we're doing now is saying
Axios dot delete and we want to pass in
the users slash whatever we want to
delete so let's delete ID 1 and you'll
see that we get nothing back but the
state is caught here with status 200 so
that's an example of how we'd use
cos inside of our reacts applications
it's quite similar to any other
application simply the access API is the
sim and the rest of the application
obviously changes to the library or
framework that you're using so thanks a
