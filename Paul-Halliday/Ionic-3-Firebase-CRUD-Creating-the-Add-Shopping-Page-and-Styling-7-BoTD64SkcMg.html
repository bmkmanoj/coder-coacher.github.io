like to add another page for us to add
something to our shopping list so let's
open up our terminal once again and
generates another page but this time we
want to call the page the add shopping
page so simply type ioniq generates page
add shopping you should see that I
generated their page named add shopping
and we can hand over and add the add
shopping page to our declarations and
entry components inside of our routes
app module so to get started let's
import from pages add a shopping / add
shopping from here we want the add
shopping page let's add that to
declarations and entry components
awesome we can now add a button from our
shopping list page to navigate us to the
add shopping page we can first start by
navigating to the shopping list door
HTML this is the view for our shopping
list page and we can change your title
to simply out of space here inside of
our shopping list and we can also add a
color to our nav bar that color is up to
you but I'll be adding primary this
comes from our variables for SES s under
the primary key here
want to change the color you're more
than welcome and you can also add a
different color inside of our nappa if
we add an eye on buttons elements we can
also pass the end attribute to our iron
buttons and what that will do is part
the button at the end of the navbar so
in this circumstance I want to add a
button and that button can have the I on
button attributes as always as well as
the icon only are a bit and what this
does is makes me button literally just
an icon so to specify what icon we want
inside of the button element itself we
can add an eye on icon but eye on icon
can have the name of ads and this will
simply make the icon be a plus so if we
save our file and before going back to
view this inside of the browser will
have to remove the eye on page decorator
from our add a shopping page so let's
remove that and like I mentioned in the
previous video about me know I exist for
you and if it doesn't that's fine and if
we now take a look inside of our app we
should see that we have our plus button
at the end of our navbar so let's add
some functionality to this button that
allows us to navigate to the add
shopping page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
