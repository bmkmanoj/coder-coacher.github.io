look at template laterals inside of es6
so before we invest the air that let's
have a look how we deal with strings at
the moment in es5 so right now I'm going
to have a great thing and the greeting
is going to say hello Paul welcome to
underscore an M and if we can console
logs out to our console we get hello
Paul welcome to afternoon not exactly
revolutionary but now we can start
taking these things and abstracting them
to particular variables so we may have a
greeting type and the greeting type in
this instance is going to be hello we
could use different types of greetings
searches high and variety of others we
can then replace that by saying greeting
type plus Paul welcome at two up them so
then we could say a let's name is equal
to you Paul and then what we do next is
say greeting type plus 9 plus not so
then we have welcome to up name and then
we might want to abstract to the app now
so let's afternoon is equal to our
underscore name now you can change this
obviously to whatever you want but at
the moment will be saying welcome to
plus up underscore name we can then put
this further down in the function after
these have been declared and then log
this out to the console and we get hello
Paul welcome that's who hafnia just the
same as before but this way of making
strings i concatenate in them with the
plus sign gets a little bit confusing
when we start adding stuff like comma
welcome to and then a space afterwards
we start to sort of lose the structure
of our string so instead of doing it
this way we can make our greeting in a
different way so in es6 we can use it be
back take and the buck tick can be found
next to z on a mac keyboards and usually
next 21 on windows keyboards the back
take instead allows us to use a template
literal which means we can bind to these
particular variables within our string
sorta bind to the greeting type variable
we can use the dollar and similar to
angular's template binding we can use
the braces but with this one we only
need to put one breast
this will get the variable from greeting
type and instead putz hello and we can
do this for every one of our variables
and let's run this again and compare it
with the initial string so if we take a
look at the string that'll give us we
have hello Paul with all these pluses
and escapes and everything we need to
get rid of them because we no longer
have to concatenate the strings and
variables with a plus sign so if we get
rid of all that and run it again
left with a much more natural strength
you may notice that this has an extra
space after howl and that's because we
have the extra space inside of all
greeting type if we remove that and run
again we get the same string as we
expected in the first scenario you'll
notice that spaces do matter inside this
es6 template literal if we add a lot of
spaces before that an invariable and run
it again we can see we get a lot of
spaces in the string we can do much more
than bind to the variables inside of our
templates literal we can also use
functions on our variables because this
is a string we can run to uppercase and
this or make the hell all in uppercase
it works just as soon as any other
string words we could also bind two
numbers so we can do arithmetic things
like for example if we went welcome to
apni mv4 version and then one plus one
it should say welcome at to version two
like that
I hope you can see the power of template
literals inside of your applications not
only doesn't make it much easier to read
but you can also perform a very powerful
things inside of your template strings
