currently have angularfire
which is firebase and that allows us to
interact with the database inside of
this app I do want to make a shopping
list which allows a user to add items to
delete items to list items and of course
edit items inside of the list so let's
start off by making a shopping list page
so we can use the ionic command-line
interface to generate this so what I
want you to do is either head over to
your terminal or you can use the
integrated terminal inside of Visual
Studio code that could be accessed by
either dragging it from the bottom like
so or alternatively at least on a Mac
the shortcut is ctrl and backtick let's
now type ionic generates page shopping
list
and this allows us to generate a page
named shopping list we can now remove
the homepage by right-clicking the
folder and selecting delete
side of our earth component TS instead
of importing home page we can instead
import and instead of importing home
page we can import the shopping list
like so we'll need to change that to be
shopping list page and set our route
page to instead be the shopping list
page if you want to use lazy loading you
can of course create a module for this
page and then instead of importing it
you can add it as a string like so
that's entirely up to you but if you'd
like to just continue the lecture as
we're doing it then leave it as we have
it on screen here
so the next thing to do is tell our app
module about this shopping list page and
that can be done by heading to up module
TS and we can remove homepage and
instead we can import the shopping list
page once again so you can just copy
that from up components and add this to
our declarations and our entry
components at this stage what we're
telling angular is that we have the
following components inside of
declarations and the entry components
should only be used for pages so if you
have any standard components simply add
them to the declarations but any pages
should be added to the entry components
the final change and you might not have
to do this but at the moment there's
currently a bug with the ionic CLI
and when we do generates that page we
are left with this ionic page decorator
you'll have to remove that from the
shopping list component when you do that
we can open up our application and we
should be greeted with the shopping list
page to open our application inside of
the browser we can run ionic lab as you
can see we're now greeted with our
shopping list
let's continue in the coming lectures to
add the create retrieve update and
delete functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
