changing the header color inside of our
ionic 3 applications so you might have
seen when you're on an Android device
and I should say this does only apply to
Android when you go on the multitask
view you see a variety of tabs fully
different applications and those have
different header colors we're gonna look
at changing the header color for our
application in this video
sorta get started and sure you've made a
new ionic project or useless inside of
your project you can do that by running
ionic start header color and I'm using
the blank template and of course adding
- - of B - after which we can add the
Cordova plug-in header color this can be
done by running ionic plugin adds
cordova - plugin - header color and just
to make things super confusing to add
the ionic native plugin it's npm install
ionic - native / Heather - color so this
one has a dash for the color the Cordova
plug-in it doesn't let's save that to
the project with - - save
you should also probably save the
Cordova plug-in to the project as well
and we'll open it up in V escort
let's start by heading over to add
module TS and let's import from at ionic
- native slash header color we want to
import the header color and then we can
add that to the list of providers by
saying header color then I'm gonna do
this one inside of our app component I'm
going to import from ionic native slash
header - color we're gonna import the
header color once again and we're also
gonna add it to our constructor so let's
inject header color as header color and
then when our platform is ready we're
simply going to say this dot header
color don't tint and the tint is going
to be the method that allows us to
assign a particular color to the task
header I'm gonna go for a nice emerald
green so let's add that right in there
and we can save the file if we run this
on Android bærum ID it won't work on
iOS we should find that our header color
is now tinted our first off at the
Android platform by running ionic
platform add Android
and then we can emulate this by running
ionic emulates androids if we then take
a look in the multi app view inside of
our emulator we can see the emerald
color for our application so this one
wraps up changing the header color
inside of an Android application using
ionic 3 if you like this hit that
subscribe button for more ionic content
and let me know in the comment section
below
my name is Paul and I'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
