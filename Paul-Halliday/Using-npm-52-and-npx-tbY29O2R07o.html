with npm 5.2 is the binary that was
installed as you can see here NP x so NP
x allows us to execute commands that we
don't necessarily have installed on our
machine so for example if we wanted to
use the cows air project to essentially
have a cows their particular set of
awards
we could have calcium say hello and
you'll notice that if we hit enter we
get command not found and that's because
we don't have the calset project on our
machine as true we could installer by
seeing NPM install cows air dash G or
alternatively as we're running NPM 5.2
we can actually see the MPX kalsa hello
and when we execute this we won't
actually get ro this time instead it
will execute the package and the result
of the package will appear on screen you
can see we now have a cow saying the
word hello
inside of our terminal that doesn't mean
it's installed the project for example
if we want to try it again we do get
command not found so it's a one time
executable and what this allows us to do
is try out packages quickly and
conveniently on our machine without
having them installed so some popular
use cases for this are things like
create react out so we could say npx
creates react up and then of course
specify a name file project and so on
this is how we'd upgrade to NPM 5.2 and
of course take advantage of things like
npx</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
