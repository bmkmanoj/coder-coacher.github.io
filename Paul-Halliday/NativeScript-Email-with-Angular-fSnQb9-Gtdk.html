adding email functionality to our
angular native script applications to
start with and sure you've made a new
native script up by running TNS create
and the project name for me is going to
be email and we're gonna base this on
the templates native script - templates
ng tutorial this will make a blank
native script angular application and
then we'll need to install the native
script email plugin so we can CD into
email and then we can say TNS plug-in
adds native script - email we can then
head over to app app component ES and
inside of up component es we can import
as email from native script - email
so inside of our up component we can
have a send email button that when we
click up runs send email for this I'm
going to have its nightly out and inside
of this nook layout we are simply going
to have a button when the user taps the
bottom course will bring on the send
email function and the text of the
button will simply be send email the
first thing that we can do is check to
see where the email is available on the
device so whether the device can
actually send an email if the device
cannot send an email we can then say the
device email status is and then let's
use a template binding to say available
so whatever the result is will be inside
of this strength if there are any errors
let's take the error and simply run with
console era and then pass in the error
message
if we check the return type for the
available function we can see that it
returns a boolean so we can say if
available we can then send an email by
saying email or compose and compose it
can take in some compose options so
let's make some compose options we will
say compose options is of type email or
compose options and we can currently set
our compose options inside of the
constructor so we can say this that
compose options is equal to and then
let's check out the compose options so
we have a subject a body a to a
potential for carbon copying any
attachments and in up picker title
so we can fill out these Campos options
and we consider - and that accepts a
string array of addresses so you can say
address one at email com address two at
email com
we can then give it a subject so the
subject over the email my native scripts
email is going to be the subject the
body will simply be hello world and if
we wanted to come up and copy this to
other people we could add another string
array here so maybe address three that's
email comm so when we're ready to
compose our email we then have to pass
in at these compose options and we can't
of course then Huck into the callback
event so if we take a look at compose we
can see that on iOS the returned boolean
indicates whether or not the email was
sent by the user
on Android or it's always true so if we
then say results and we console dot log
the results on iOS if the user was to
send the email this will be true if they
didn't send the email it will be false
but of course on Android it will be true
regardless and if there's any errors we
can of course here again simply console
the era the era that's also say console
but log the email was sent on maybe I
should say the email was potentially
sent and we can say if result else
console that log
the email may not have been sent like I
said we can only find out that one if
it's iOS
so let's quickly review what exactly
we're doing here so we have a button
inside of its static layout and when the
user clicks the button they send email
function is executed this starts off by
determining whether the email is
available on the device if it is
available we aren't going to compose an
email based on these compose options and
we could to bring these compose options
into the send email because this of
course could change depending on some
sort of user input and then we'll log
out the results if the email was
successful or unsuccessful ie if it was
sent if the email was true then we can
potentially say that it was sent because
obviously we get the true on Android but
we will know if it was sent on iOS else
if it's not true we can say that the
email may not have been sent because we
do get the correct true or false on iOS
and then of course we're catching errors
based on whether the compose worked and
whether the email was available we can
now run this on our device by running
TNS run Android this will install the
Android platform and of course runner on
our device
if I click the send email button we are
taken to the compose screen of our email
application this automatically includes
both the two from and Carvin coffee
fields as well as the subject and body
from here on out we can select send
and our email would be sent so that
about wraps up sending email within
native script if you do of course like
these Veneto scrub videos then hit that
