site we have to head back over to
indexed or handlebars and at this moment
in time we are simply displaying this
postcard inside of a for each and that's
fine because it's exactly what we're
going to be doing but now instead of
having the postcard inside of this for
each blog I want to have it inside of a
div with a class of column and we can
stick our postcard in there and that
means that we need an overall container
so we can give mainly class of container
we can also then create a list of
columns so we'll have a div underneath
our main with a class of columns and
we'll stick our forage inside of there
if we then refresh our page and we make
it a little larger you'll see that of
course we have these columns now which
is appearing on screen but if we change
our screen to be a certain width you'll
see that it then changes to one column
so we go from one to three columns but
perhaps it will be better if our columns
were multi-line so let's add is -
multi-line - our columns and we'll make
each one of these postcards take up half
of the column so let's add is - half and
when we add that you'll see that we now
get these two posts so you don't have
three anymore or as many as it could fit
it would have six or seven or however
many you could fit on that one line but
instead now we have two at the same time
just to make sure everything centered
I'm not sure we need to add this but I
do wanna add is centered to our column
just so everything remains centered no
matter what we may be able to remit that
and we may come back to that remover in
the future so now when we take a look at
our application you can see that we have
these three items let's head over to our
package.json now
and inside of all package.json we can
change our posts per page to be
something like five this will allow us
to display some more information
and this gives us the feeling of more
posts but we don't have to create any
other posts if that makes sense in order
to change this we can run course stop
and Galston start development then we
have five items on screen but we still
have this next button at the bottom
I have noticed one problem with our
cards though we are using a lot of the
card content and card image but we
aren't actually using the card class so
let's go back over to our post on the
scorecard or handlebars and we'll give
our article the class of cards and then
you'll see that we have this drop shadow
at the bottom of our cards or rather
around the cards this makes it look a
little more professional and matches the
aesthetic of our cards so up next let's
look at how we can add a footer to our
home page and then after that we'll also
look at things like changing our
pagination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
