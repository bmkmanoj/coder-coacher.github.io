using energy if inside of our angular
for applications we'll also take a look
at using the else statement that was
introduced inside angular fall I'm gonna
be using an example website here so this
shows a list of courses that are on
offer you can add a course to the cart
or you can see details about the course
the most important thing about this is I
want to display a different image if the
course is on sale so maybe we'll have a
little sale box at the top right of the
image we can do this by using ng-if so
if the course is not on sale I want to
display the current image so let's make
a variable inside of our courses
component and we're gonna say is course
on sale and at the moment it's false
because the course is not on sale so
we'll build the ngf to display this
image in our template when the course is
not on sale so ng-if is course on sale
we can save that and the cause image
still appears because the course is not
on sale but we've decided we're gonna do
an entry 50% off launch so for that
we're gonna say else and then we need to
pass it different templates so we're
going to show a different image if the
course is on sale
so let's write a new ng - templates and
we'll give this a template variable of
sale image and instead we'll pass
through a different image element we'll
use assets image I three underscore sale
we can then update our ngf to basically
say if the course is not on sale then we
show this but if it is on sale we can
talk about template variable of sale
image if I then toggle the boolean
inside of all courses component to show
true we can see that we get that
different image with the sale tag on the
top right so hopefully now you'll be
able to take advantage of both ng-if and
the
you else statement inside of your
angular 4 applications if you found this
useful then hit that subscribe button
because there's many more videos on the
way and until next time my name is Paul
and I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
