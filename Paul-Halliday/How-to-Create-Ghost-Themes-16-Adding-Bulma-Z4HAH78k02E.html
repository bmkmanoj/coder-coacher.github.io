we need to include a new style sheet and
I put this underneath the title and we
are going to put the style sheet hedge
ref the CDN for bomber so you can find
the CDN by simply typing bomber CDN into
Google and then you'll be able to add
this to your hedge graph at the moment
this is currently 0.53 but as time goes
by this version number will change if
you want to keep absolute compatibility
with this course as it's being created I
would use a 0.53 so when we refresh our
page you should notice something
different this is that everything now is
the same size you'll notice that inside
of all indexed or HBS we have this h1
and h2 but traditionally the h1 is
bigger than the h2 but bombers
standardizes everything this allows us
to add a class of something like title
to our blog title and we could define
the description as a subtitle thus
allowing us to style our hedge funds
through hedge anything can even stuff
like P with different classes next we're
going to look at creating partial files
partial files allow us to then break up
our content for example we could take
this header and move it out of this file
it's really important as we come to
developing a scalable theme that not
only us but our end user can then edit
and this means smaller files that only
do one thing are much more important
let's take a look at that in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
