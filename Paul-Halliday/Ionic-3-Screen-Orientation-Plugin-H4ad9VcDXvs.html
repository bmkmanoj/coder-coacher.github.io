setting and locking the screen
orientation on a device with ionic so
let's start off by installing the
Cordova plugin named Cordova plugin
screen orientation if you are asked to
install BCI plugin for Cordova hit yes
and continue with the installation after
that we can install the ionic native
plugin by saying npm install ads ionic
native / screen orientation this plugin
is supported on Android BlackBerry 10
iOS and Windows we can then open this up
inside of our code editor which install
off by importing screen orientation from
ionic native / a screen orientation
inside of our routes app module we can
then add this to the list of providers
inside of our components I'm going to do
the sim
and inject this inside of all
constructor as screen orientation
I'm going to make a few functions the
first will be against current screen
orientation and that one is as simple as
logging out they stop screen orientation
dot type so this contains the current
screen orientation such as landscape
next I'll make a function named unlock
screen orientation and lock screen
orientation as you may imagine these
lower us to simply lock the orientation
with this screen orientation lock and
inside of here we can pass in using this
screen orientation dot orientations in
particular orientation to lock the
application at so if we look the
orientation in landscape modes then the
app would be stuck to that and the user
wouldn't be able to navigate away from
being landscape as this returns a
promise I'm going to make this a sync
and I will put this inside of a
try-catch if the Arne arrows will simply
log on the earth to the console but if
not we will lock the orientation now
let's take a look at unlocking the
orientation so we can see this top
screen orientation dots unlock and that
simply unlocks and allows all
orientations next we have the option to
observe the screen orientation and that
can be done with this dot screen
orientation dot on change and as you can
see this returns an observable that
fires each time the orientation changes
so here we can simply log out the
application orientation has changed do
be aware that you will have to
unsubscribe from your observable if
you're using this inside your
application and you finished watching
the screen orientation I'm now going to
head over to home the HTML and I'm going
to change the title and navbar color
want to add a few buttons I had I
unbutton clear block and in this
occasion I will say the click events is
equal to get current screen orientation
so that when the user clicks this button
we should have the current screen
orientation log down to the console
let's make another button and that one
will be the lock screen orientation that
will stop the user from using any other
orientation other than landscape will
make another button this time it will be
unlocked screen orientation and finally
we'll have a final button and that one
will be called observed screen
orientation
each time the orientation changes we
will of course get a log out to the
console with that observable
servable we will of course get a log to
the console every time that the screen
orientation changes
so with all that in mind let's run this
on the device I'm going to add - L in
case we need to change anything but of
course start a live reload Slava and
we're doing it by saying ionic Cordova
run Android - shell
so let's start by guessing the current
orientation I'm going to head the gas
orientation button and you can see that
we are currently on portrait primary if
I instead go to landscape and I click
get orientation we're now in landscape
primary if I click lock orientation and
I have moved my phone away from
landscape it's now in the prorate
position and I can't get it to unlock
but if I click unlock you'll see that
we've now gone to airport Rhett
if I click get orientation with butter
parades
and finally if I set up our observable
and click observe orientation and now I
switch we get the application
orientation has changed like so and each
time if I wanted to I could click gets
orientation and that would change
appropriately we could even head over to
our observable here and we could instead
say that the application orientation has
changed too and then we can pass in this
dot screen orientation don't type and if
we observe the orientation at one last
time you can see that it's changed to
landscape primary and pore rate if we
change it the other way you can see that
it goes to landscape secondary and so on
so that's how we use the screen
orientation plugin inside of our ionic
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
