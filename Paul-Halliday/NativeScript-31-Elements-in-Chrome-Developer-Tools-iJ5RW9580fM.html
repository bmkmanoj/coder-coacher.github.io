elements tab inside of our chrome
developer tools when we're debugging the
Android application so let's start off
by saying TNS debug Android on one of
our native script apps well this does is
starts off at the live reload server as
before and runs our application on a
device or on an emulator but at the same
time it also gives us this native script
debugger link and as you can see here to
start the bugging open the following URL
in chrome so if we navigate to this URL
inside of chrome you can see that we
have a list of elements one contains the
action bar and the other is the view
container and the view container because
we are starting if sample ng or angular
application so as you can see it's the
standard angular template we can select
a particular player and then go back to
the list
so if we change this title now to be
native scripts you'll notice how this
changes on our application but we don't
have to restart our app evidently the
changes aren't persisted to file either
so it's the same as your normal chrome
dev tools elements experience so for
example if we restart the app it will go
back to being my app we could also head
back over to the developer tools and go
to our proxy View container and we can
edit remove or do you want where things
like the level here so we could change
this level text to instead be Paul
Hauser and as you can see this is
updated in real time on our application
as well as that we can see things like
the stack so for example we start at the
page we go to our proxy View container
stuck way out let's be another stack
layout and then our label so we do have
a lot of power and functionality inside
of our elements
and of course as well as elements we
still do have things like the console
which if you've not used the chrome
developer tools with your near described
apps you'll definitely find this very
useful overall it's a great release for
androids and it keeps the platform
growing and that's what's important we
will of course the iOS in a later
release currently most likely 3.2 so do
expect iOS later on earlier
so that's how we use the elements tab
inside of Neda scrubs 3.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
