dependencies that we'll need inside of
this project the first dependency that
we'll need is Nords Janice and nodejs
allows us to run the JavaScript CLI and
no Jess is once a ghost CLI runs on so
what we need to do is go down to the
version list that's at no J's org if we
hit downloads and previous releases we
can scroll down to node 6.50 you may be
asking yourself why this specific
version well this is the latest version
that we can use at this moment in time
with the ghost CLI so let's hit
downloads on that particular version and
inside of here we can scroll down to the
windows either x64 for sixties for vents
or x86 for 32-bit operating systems and
download and install the don't zip file
if you're on Mac OS we're gonna look at
that in the next video once you've
installed an audience on Windows you
should then be able to say npm - v and
no - v - check to see whether this
installed correctly
if it did you should get the following
numbers or numbers very very similar but
you do have to have nodes at 6'5 0 if
all s work correctly then you can run
npm install and this installs the
following package ghost - CLI - g now if
you've never seen any of these commands
before essentially what we're doing is
we're installing the ghost command line
interface globally here on our machine
what does this mean well it means that
we can use the ghost CLI anywhere in the
terminal we'll be using this to create a
new ghost instance and we'll be using
that to develop our theme against so
this gives us access to the ghost API as
well as a variety of different posts
tags and so on so we have sample data
there that we can use with our theme
when that has installed you should see a
message similar to the above showing the
differ
dependencies and if you're not running
Mac OS which I assume you're not because
you're installing on Windows just skip
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
