flutter if you haven't seen flutter
before it's a open source UI framework
developed by Google and this video has
an introduction to flutter art school or
vat flutter academy.com
so you can either follow along on the
video or the article it's up to you so
it allows us to make cross-platform
native ios and android applications
using dart and as always with most of
modern application development
frameworks and titles it allows us to
take advantage of hot reloading and a
variety of other features that helps
make our applications much better to
develop so to get started will of course
be installing flutter on our machine so
let's head over to flutter don't I all
and we'll hit get started and you can
follow the instructions either on
Windows Mac or Linux it's quite simple
all you need to do is download the
flutter SDK and add it to your path and
a variety of other things such as the
Android and iOS SDKs if necessary if
you've ever used any other mobile app
frameworks such as native script ionic
or even done native app development
before you should be ready to go by
simply just installing the flutter SDK
outside of that we want to create a new
flood application and that can be done
by saying flutter create once we of
course have that inside of our path and
then the name of our project at this
moment we'll call our project demo will
then change directory and open up inside
of vs courts so if you do get era such
as flutter commands no phones you'll
need to ensure that flavor has been
added to your environment variables now
you can check the out on Windows or Mac
by simply just typing environment
variables and then Mac or Windows so
let's head over to main dot dot inside
of the Lib folder and you can see that
we have this one file that contains a
class of my app and this extends the
stateful widgets we then have this build
function and if we scroll down you can
see we then have a home page class and
this home page stats
now if you
kind of flutter for the first time and
we scroll through this a hundred and ten
lines of chords you may find that you do
feel a little bit confused and that's
because at this moment in time you
really haven't learned the difference
between a starless widgets is still full
widget and the concepts of the build
function so what I want to do is instead
delete everything and we'll build this
from scratch it will simplified version
at least so we have now the void main
function so that's how bootstrap
function here and that's going to be
running the app spawning a new my app
which we're about to create so let's
make a new class and that class is gonna
be called my app and it's gonna extend
its starless widget and as far as a
stateless widget cause at this moment
just know that effectively this class
does not manage its own States we simply
want to display this same content and
that content will just be some text that
says hello flutter it's not dependent on
any application state it doesn't need to
reload and so on in order to display
that text we need to use the build
function that can be thought of as the
main function of the class and it's
similar to the render function inside of
things like react at GS X so we can
effectively render a widget tree so we
need to override the build function and
that's a widgets and pass in the build
context like so inside of here we'll
return a new text widget and the text
that will say hello flutter it will set
the text direction to text direction dot
left to right
so now we can see that this widget
itself the class of my app is simply
returning in you text widgets that says
hello flutter let's run this on the
device and we'll see what it looks like
and this moment or perhaps earlier on in
the tutorial when you open up visual
studio codes you may've been asked to
install the dart cord extension I'd
advise installing that because it allows
us to edit and debug our flutter
applications on the fly and we don't
have to pass out to the terminal
so let's hit f5 and what we'll do is
start debugging we wanted to bug with
dart and flutter and as you can see at
the bottom inside of our debug console
it's going to open up this inside of the
iPhone 10 because I have the iPhone 10
simulator up and running alternatively
you could start the Android simulator
and run out on that but I just before
iOS because I already have this emulator
open so the application has opened up
and we can see the words hello flutter
on screen but that's at the top left so
we can imagine that sort of 0 0
coordinates and of course it's blocking
off half of those words so let's make it
so the text is in the middle of the
screen so this is where we're sort of
introduced for the first time the
widgets and widget tree concept inside
of flutter so we don't have a sort of
domain-specific view templating language
that we can use such as HTML or XML
instead we're using this widget tree so
we want to return a new Center and this
will Center anything that's a child of
Center so we'll set the child equal to
in new text and as you can see instead
of returning if the text itself we're
returning now a center that has a child
of the text so this will mean that
instead of being at the top left it
should now be in the middle in order to
ensure this updates on your device you
can hit this green arrow here from
within its side of visual studio chords
and they should restart it and hot
reload the application here we now have
hello flutter on screen it's in the
middle like so the problem is of this
one those
the text itself is quite small can't
really see that so we need a way to sort
of a style this font well let's add a
style era beads to our text and we can
say that we want to use a new text style
we'll set the font size to 48 2.0 and
that's because that's a double and the
font weights will be sent to
font-weight:bold so as you can see we
have a center that returns a text and
now we've added that style our beads if
we check back in our application we now
have a much bigger text on screen but
this doesn't really look like a normal
app usually we'd have a nav bar and it
may be a container in the middle before
we jump into that I'd rather take our
text and make it into its own widgets so
let's make it text called hello flutter
text and that will extend the starless
widget and we'll just take this widget
build override and we'll paste it into
that class and instead of returning all
this will return a new hello
flutter text so if we save this we
should have exactly the same result and
then of course we could use this
throughout our application so it just
makes it much easier when it comes to
reusing you I know let's now make a app
bar so that we can take advantage of the
iOS and Android features that we've come
to know love so instead of returning the
new Hello flutter text I want to return
a new material app inside of here we'll
put the title to my first flutter app
and the home page so this is the default
route will be the new Hello flutter text
so let's save the file and run this
again so we have largely the same thing
as before but now our text has gone Reds
and we have this yellow underline now if
that happens that's a good sign because
what it means is that we need to use a
scaffold the scaffold provides us with
the basic material design infrastructure
such as the navigation bar the draw
floating action
and so on so we can create new widgets
and that we called homepage which we can
use to display this scaffold so let's do
this by making a class called homepage
and we'll extend the starless widget
will overrides the build method once
again but this time we want to return a
new scaffold and the scaffold as you can
see has a variety of different things it
has everything from an app bar to a draw
and much more let's specify the app bar
and we want to return a new app bar that
will have a title which will be a new
text widget called this dot title so
this will return a title which will pass
in to this class in a moment so right
now it's gonna give us an error and
that's fine after the app bar we want to
return a body and that's gonna be our
container so for now we'll simply return
the new hello flutter text so let's
declare a string called title and inside
of our constructor we'll pass in the
title so our home page now accepts a
title and will return any scaffold as a
result that contains the navbar with the
title of the title that we pass into
this class and the body equal to the
hello flutter text so that will simply
be the container underneath the app bar
finally all we have to do at this point
is change our home route and instead
this will be a new home page we'll pass
in the title of home page and hit save
so off to a great start this is all
first a flutter application I hope
