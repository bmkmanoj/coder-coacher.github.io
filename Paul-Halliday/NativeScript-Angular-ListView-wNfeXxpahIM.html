video we're going to be creating this
ListView with native script what we're
going to do is get these three people on
screen and when we select a person we'll
have the index and the person inside of
the arere let's dive in and create this
project so a Demont we have a blank
angular native script project with the
action bar having a title of ListView
let's create ourselves a list inside of
our constructor so perhaps you'll have a
list of people and we can create a class
for this so saying that it's a list of
persons let's simply make a class named
person we can then add a constructor
that contains some information such as
an ID of type number our name of type
string and an edge of type number inside
vall constructor we can then assign our
people to contain things like an ID of 0
a name of Paul Halliday and an edge of
something like 25 if we repeat this for
each one of our persons inside of the
people array
this men gives us an array that we can
show on screen with a list view so I'm
going to add a list view to our template
if we do that underneath our action bar
we can add the list view components and
we can assign the items attributes to be
equal to people and that's of course the
property inside of our class inside of
our list view we can create a template
so that we can show how we want the
items to appear
let's add an NG template with s stuck
layout inside the stuck whales can
contain a level with information from
the person in this instance I'm simply
going to display the name of the person
so let's add a level and to display the
person's name as text we have to bind
the item to our templates so let's add
let item to be item and as a result we
can see item don't name inside of our
level if we save our file and take a
look at our application we can see that
we now have this ListView with three
items inside we can select the item but
nothing happens when we do that because
we haven't assigned an on tap event
so inside vault ListView let's add an
item tap event that we can pass to a
function that can be called anything but
we'll call it on item tab will pass
through the selected item arguments as
an event so if we go ahead and create
our own item tab function we should now
be able to get the index of the person
that was clicked we can use a template
literal to say console.log the following
person was selected and then of course
pass then the args dot index if we then
take a look at our project and we select
for example Paul Halliday we can see
that the following person was selected
at index 0 the same goes for John and
Sarah each with having 0 1 and 2 in this
circumstance we can work out who was
selected by matching the index to our
person's ID so we can say that the
selected person is our filtered array
where the ID matches the current index
to work out who is actually selected we
can take our people array and simply
look at only that index so if we had a
selected person we may say something
like
this dot people and then of course pass
in that args dot index let's change this
now to be the following index was
selected and then we can say that the
following person was then selected with
the selected person name because this is
now allowing us to see into the selected
index
if we select one of the people such as
Paul we can see that the following
person was selected being myself and
then it different index with a different
person
so now we're able to determine which
index was selected and also filter our
data for that specific person our list
you could do with being styled a little
bit better
let's add the class of list group to our
list view and the class of list group
item to our stack layout and now you can
see that we have more spacing inside of
our list view and our items can be
selected with the appropriate index
inside of our a rare so that's how we
might integrate a list view inside of a
native script angular application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
