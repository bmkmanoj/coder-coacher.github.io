using the pin check plugin this allows
your application to check whether a pin
or passcode is set up on iOS or Android
devices so we can start off by adding
the Cordova plug in let's say ionic
Cordova plug-in adds Cordova plug-in pin
it check if you are asked to install the
COI plugin for Cordova here yes to
continue now that we've done that we can
install the ionic need of plugin by
saying at ionic native slash pin check
and of course we'll need to add - - save
if you're not running NPM five and above
like I said this is supported on both
Android and iOS and with that said let's
open up inside of es chords
as always let's head over to our art
module TS and we can import pin check
from ionic native slash pen check we can
then add this to the list of providers
and once we've done that we can head
over to the components in which we want
to use this plugin so I'll be using this
inside of the home page I won't need the
nav controller cell remove that and I
will inject this by saying private spin
check F type pin check let's import that
from ionic native and we can make
ourselves if function named check if pen
setup it does return a promise so we
will make this air sink and we'll also
add a try-catch if there are any others
we will use console error to display
them inside of the console after that we
can await so use the resolved promise
on this dope in check don't is pin set
up as you can see here this returns a
promise of type boolean so we can store
the result in a constant
I'm going to say Const results is equal
to that response
console dot log the results and inside
of home dot HTML I will change the title
to is pin setup
I also add a color to our navbar and one
singular button
we'll give the ion buffing Arab you to
the clear Arab it and of course the
block Arab it with the click events of
check if pen is set up let's run this
inside of our phone and I'm going to say
ionic Cordova run Android - el this will
allow us to start a live reload server
on the device so any changes we make on
the computer or automatically updated on
the device so I'm going to quickly but
now check if pin setup and as you can
see we do get pin underscore setup here
on the device because I do actually have
a pin I've gone ahead and removed the
pin from my device and if I click it
once again we get north pin setup and it
comes as an error at this point and
that's because we are assigning the
catch to display the results as an error
you can go ahead and do whatever you
want with that but like I said initially
we are finding that we do that the pin
setup when we do have a pin and then of
course we get nor pin setup on the user
does not have a pin I was expecting this
to return true or false given that the
interface does say that it returns a
boolean but I guess this is kind of a
boolean of sorts because there's only
two specific values either pin setup or
nor pen setup so just keep that in mind
if you are expecting it true or false so
that's how we integrate the pin check
plugin inside of our ionic applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
