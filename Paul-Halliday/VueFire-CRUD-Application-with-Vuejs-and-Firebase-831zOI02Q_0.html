view GS and firebase what I'm gonna show
you in this video is how we can make
this create retrieve update delete
application simply allows us to add a
person we can then edit them can change
the name to be something like kids we
can save that but also we can cancel we
can remove and add as many people as we
want that's all coming up in this video
and if you like this video let me know
inside of the comments section below
let's get started so let's dive in and
create an application with view and
firebase to get started let's install
the view CLI by saying npm install view
- CLI - g this will install us globally
on your machine and then you'll be able
to access the vcli by simply saying view
let's create a new project with the view
CLI by saying view in it based on the
web pack - a simple template and I'll
call s V fire this should go ahead and
download the template and then we'll
have the Wizards this asks us for a
project name and we'll call our project
name V fire a description will simply be
a create retrieve update delete
application with view and fibers the
author is myself and at this moment in
time we will not be using SAS so we've
generated a new project named V fire we
can then CD into that directory and we
can run npm install to install any
dependencies so far so good
we now need to install firebase using
NPM install fibers and view fire V fire
simply allows us to use firebase inside
of our view applications with some nice
bindings so once we've done that that's
all the setup we need to do we can
simply run our application using NPM run
dev and I'm also going to open this up
inside a visual studio chords if you've
done everything correctly so far you
should then be able to see your view
jazz application here on screen and also
inside of our
dot view which is in the sorcerer folder
will be removing everything inside this
div tag so let's remove everything
except the dev inside of our export
default I'll simply be leaving the data
for now and you know what I think I'll
keep the styles I might change and add a
style for a button because we will be
using a button I'll have to give this a
background color of transparent and I
think we'll give this a border of two
pixels solid blank so you should have an
empty screen but we are going to keep
the styling you can delete the styling
if you want to as you may be using your
own styling at this point not too
important for 5s integration but the
next thing to do is of course integrate
firebase so let's get the firebase API
keys that we need for our project the
first step is of course to head over to
firebase google.com and this will allow
you to then sign in with your Google
account by hitting Corte console and
creating your first or maybe not first
fire best project let's hit add project
and when the pop-up comes up and simply
going to type firebase view and of
course my country slash region is the
United Kingdom so we can hit create
project and then we'll get the firebase
dashboard awesome we're now on the
fibers dashboards and we are greeted
with at 5 St or iOS app Android app and
web app simply select web app to
continue and this will give you your API
key
when you do select to add five st or web
app you should then get a script which
allows us to initialize firebase the
only thing we need from the script here
is just this javascript object let's
copy this the things that contain the
API key the author main the database URL
and so on so copy this into our
application and we will be getting it
into our application is by making a new
file on the source called firebase GS
and this is got to be a very simple file
we'll simply import from firebase the
thing I want is initialize app this
allows us to make an app by saying con
stop is equal to initialize up and pass
in that information so we should have
things like your API key earthdome in
database URL and so on we may want to
export a reference in this file we don't
have to but we could we could also
export it database for us to use
throughout the project so some examples
would be something like this if it
export the database as a constant I'll
be equal to the app database and perhaps
we were creating a list of names we
could export a constant with the names
ref equal to DB dot ref and that will
point that at names your implementation
might be different it's just a way to
access the names reference throughout
our application as we only have one
reference at this point and this will
come to make sense in a moment the final
thing to do is for setting up 5s and our
project is to head over to mentor GS and
simply import firebase and what I'll do
is I'll import the fibers initialize up
function it will allow us to then
initialize the app and use fibers
throughout our project the other thing
we need to do is import view fire from a
view fire
and we can add it to view as a plugin so
we can simply say if you don't use view
fire after that everything is completely
set up and configured with firebase our
journey then heads across to app view
and this is essentially the file that
we're seeing on screen at the moment
it's obviously blank but that's gonna
change when we add some content so let's
start off by adding a div inside of our
div with the ID of app this is where
view is registered and I'm simply gonna
add a label in here the labels gotta say
name and then we'll have an input the
input will be of type text and we'll
have a button the button will simply say
add so when we save the file you'll see
that we have name in input box and the
ability to add this specific name so
thankfully was view we don't really need
to do much to hook this up to firebase
all we need to do is add a V - model to
our inputs and we'll simply add name to
that this will capture the value of the
input and stored in a variable named NIM
if we wanted to we could simply add
something to our data same name and we
could have a default value for example
of Paul you can then see that this does
automatically fill our input box and
let's say we wanted to submit this name
to firebase so then we could view the
name on screen well we could do that if
we add in methods and for our methods we
could have a function called submit name
so at this point in time we need to
capture a reference to our firebase
database
well we already exported this with DB
and the names reference so at this point
in time you could either imports from
firebase and do remember that so a fiber
script file either DB or our names ref
I'm going to import the names ref and
I'm simply gonna send names ref dot push
and at this point in time I'm gonna have
the name equal to this dot name and I'm
also gonna add an edit to false
now you could handle the editing on the
client side but I'm gonna handle it on
firebase for now just be
I want to show things like update and
set as we get further on into the video
so at this moment in time we have name
and edits when the user clicks this
button I want to fire this submit name
function so let's add an @ sign and say
click equals submit name this should be
all needs to actually submit the name to
our firebase database if we were to hit
add it should add this to the database
but as you can see at this moment in
time we have a permission that denied
ora and this is one of the things about
firebase is that we do need to declare
some security rules or we need to be
authenticated so let's head back over to
our firebase dashboard and under the
database we can select rules and here
I'm simply going to change read and
write to be true on both occasions
if we hit publish you should see that
your security rules are now defined as
public and anybody can read or write to
your database this is something you keep
in mind if you got a punch to that
stupid unction please don't make sure
that you have your rules sorted out so
if we then select data any date and that
we push up to our database shut appear
in this tab
so now if we hit the Add button inside
of our application notice that we get no
console RR if we then like on our five
best dashboards we can see names and
this has a new ID and we can see that
we're currently add the Singh equal to
false and name equal to Paul like I said
I would usually handle the adder on the
client side but at this point in time
were simply adding it on the server so
we've got the ability to add in him I
now want to see this name on screen so
thankfully with view and view fire this
is an easy thing so all we need to do is
add a firebase object and we could set
the names equal to our names ref next
inside of our HTML I'm going to add
another div this time it's going to
contain a ul and an Li and we'll add air
v4 for a full loop I could have the
person name of names will also bind the
current key to the person named dot key
simply the current key of this person
inside of our fibers database if we then
display this on screen by saying person
name you can then see that we have edits
equal to false name equal to pool and
then of course our key so if we simply
wanted to display the name we could say
a person name don't name so now you can
see that we can add as many people as we
want to this list if we were to add kids
and hit add we'd get another person
inside of our list let's get rid of the
Li display:inline-block and now for each
one of these people I want to add a
button for us to remove them from the
list so I'm going to surround the person
named in a paragraph tank and I will
give this a button with the click event
of remove person we can pass in the
person name and that person's key all we
need to do now is simply adds it remove
a bit of text to the button and inside
of our methods we can add a new method
named remove NIM and if we had the key
as a parameter we can capture the nihms
reference the child being the key and
simply use the remove methods once we
save this and we now select to remove it
should remove somebody but we haven't
actually named this correctly let's
change this to remove NIM and once we
select a person now it removes it from
the list we could then add that back and
remove them and so on when we add
somebody to the list we could also say
this name is equal to a simple and
d string and this would remove it from
the textbox let's also get rid of the
default value of pole
and if we were to add Paul once again
you'd see that it goes here and our text
box is now removed so what's next now we
need an edit button let's also add a
button with the text of edits and the
click events of edit name and we'll pass
in the person name as well as that key
so now we get the key if we elect to
edit this person and if we had edit them
and in fact what I'm going to say is set
edit name because this will simply set
the Edit equal to true on our server
side we'll pass in that key and we'll
say the name reference dot child will be
that key and all I want to do at this
point is simply update and what update
does is it takes the current Nords and
only updates what we want to update so
one up there everything you want remove
everything and simply leave edits equal
to true it will simply only update the
Edit key so if we said this and we liked
to hit edit
we need to spell names rafa correctly
first but when we do that we should then
be able to see on our server side edit
becomes true whenever becomes true I
want to display a text box with the
value of Paul or whatever the current
name is and the way that this is going
to work hasn't got to surround the
current content here inside of a div and
if you've dealt with angular before you
should know this one off by hearts we're
going to use a VF and a V else so this
one here is going to be a VF the person
name does not have edit equal to true
so if we're not currently editing then I
just want to show a standard version in
which we can elect to either remove the
person or edit that person we can create
another div but this time with the V -
else directive and this time we can have
an input box with the type of text and
the v-model equal to the person name
don't name
notice that the person's name that we
are currently editing has now appeared
and I want to button to save the edits
and also a button to cancel the edit
just like that so we need two more
functions the first will the click event
of save edits for that person in but
notice how this time I'm not going to
pass through the key and passing through
the person name so that we can elect to
capture the key but also we can update
the field to include that person's name
for the click event for our cancel edits
I kind of like to simply only pass
through the key because that's all we
need let's start off with the cancel
edit first so let's have a cancel edit
and that will be the key all we need to
do at this point to say names ref pass
in the child key again and updates the
fact that we are no longer editing so if
we click cancel you can see we're no
longer editing in this works no matter
how many people that we actually click
and the final thing to do is of course
save the edit so we can make a new
function name save edits but this one
will be the name
and for this we can use another function
that we haven't looked at yet we could
use updates once again but we could also
use set now sent overwrite the current
object so instead of simply updating the
keys within the object it will overwrite
the object
so how do we capture the key well of
course the key is the name and it's the
dot key inside of that object we want to
then set a new object which has the name
and that is name don't name so we could
change this to be person and perhaps we
want to refactor our application so we
are now looking at the name of the
person and we also want edit equal to
false because we no longer want to edit
that person so this now should allow us
to save those edits so if we edit this
and we change this to instead be Barry
and we click Save you can now see that
instead of Paul we now get Barry we can
edit we can cancel we can remove and so
on so there are ways to make this less
of a boss but I do think that for the
time that was spent we have certainly
got a powerful view application that
interacts with firebase view fire and so
on so that's about it thanks a lot for
watching don't forget a check out Paul
Halladay done I offer more courses and
free content don't forget to hit that
