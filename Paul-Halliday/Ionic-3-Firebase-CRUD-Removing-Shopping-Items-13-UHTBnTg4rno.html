going to head back over to our shopping
list at TT s and we can make ourselves a
function named select a shopping item
and we can give the user an option of
perhaps editing the item removing the
item or cancelling the selection so
essentially we want to display an action
sheet that gives the user the following
options
number one edits the shopping item
number two delete the shopping item
number three cancel selection so in
order to display this action sheet what
we need to do is head over to our
constructor here and simply add a
private action sheet of type action
sheet now action sheet itself comes from
ionic angular let's import that from
ionic angular like so by saying imports
action sheet controller let's now
display the action sheet to the user and
we can do that by importing the action
sheet controller from ionic angular so
when you've imported that we can inject
it here inside of the constructor by
saying private action sheet control F
type action sheet controller
in action sheets we can say this done
action sheet controller dot create and
in here we can pass in the action sheet
options we can either make them outside
of the sanction sheet or declare them
inside of this object let's simply
declare them inside of the object we can
first off shore Air title
title for the action sheet should be
equal to the shopping item that the user
has selected so in order to find out the
shopping item that the user has selected
we need to pass in a shopping item of
type shopping item so now we have an
appropriate reference so we can say that
the title should be equal to I'm going
to be using backticks here and a bath
tick allows us to use a template string
you can access the back take by hitting
the button next to Z on a Mac keyboards
and one on a quasi keyboards and we can
simply save dollar and then if we add
the braces here we can add a shopping
item dot item nem that allows us to get
a reference to the shopping item name
and then we can pass in particular
buttons so the first button like we said
can have the text of edit each button
can have a handler and what this
essentially does
if the handler allows us to define some
functionality for when the user selects
this button so now we will simply add a
comment which will be in the future send
the user to the Edit shopping item page
and pass the key as a parameter because
if you think about it that's what we're
going to need to do we're going to need
to pass the particular shopping item on
the list across to the Edit shopping
item page and the user is of course
going to be navigated to that particular
page
we make this different by showing em
model or showing an alert controller but
for now I think enough control and
sending the user a way to a different
page is a decent enough idea after that
we can add another button and that
button will have the text of delete it
will have the rule of destructive
because this is essentially a delete
button and we can add a handler here
we'll delete the current shopping item
and the final button that we need to
create is our cancel button so let's add
the text of cancel the rule of cancel
and the handler function in this
circumstance will just be a console the
log for the user has selected the cancel
button the final thing to do after all
of this
to present the action sheet to the user
so let's hook up this shopping list so
that now inside of our shopping list or
HTML the view for our shopping list we
can have a click event which selects be
shopping item and we can pass through
that item by passing the item as a
parameter we have a reference to that
particular shopping item if we then
navigate to the delete section inside of
our action sheet controller we can
delete the current shopping item by
saying this dot shopping list reference
dot remove and then we can pass in the
shopping item dot dollar key
and the dollar key is their reference to
this key here so when we remove this we
essentially remove it from our shopping
list but you will notice at this point
in time we do now have a red underline
and that's because it's saying that the
dollar key does not exist on the type of
shopping item in this circumstance all
we need to do is head back over to our
interface and in a more complex
application you may want to have a
difference for a view model and air
model where we would add the key to our
view model only but in this circumstance
we can get away with just adding a
dollar key of type string but if we add
this question mark the Elvis operator
here we're essentially saying that this
key is optional so that when we create a
shopping item it's not necessarily
required because their kid perhaps be a
certain circumstance well we don't have
it double key this example would be well
worth creating it on our add shopping
page but as you can see at the moment
we're deleting the current shopping item
and that's passed in by the parameter
so let's add pass then via the parameter
so inside of all shopping list I'm now
going to select chicken because to be
honest I preferred her when we had 10
amount of ice cream
so let's now select delete' on chicken
you can see that the chicken has been
removed from our list and also it's been
removed from firebase no matter how many
times we refresh firebase or our
application it's being deleted from the
database so in this lecture was locked
to adding an action sheet
we've also lock to adding different
actions for our action sheet
so far we've added the delinked
functionality inside of all firebase
database and our ionic application
always past the reference of our
shopping item
move this comments outside of the
function like so
take a look now with adding an edit
shopping item page as well as updating
our list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
