application that the user can enter
something and we can then log out that
name to the console let's make this even
more powerful by adding a toast at the
bottom of the screen that displays M
message to the user so we won't need the
nav controller so let's remove this from
our constructor for now and let's also
remove it from the import here and
replace the nav controller import with
the toast controller we can inject this
inside of all constructor so that we
have a class variable that we can use so
we can say privates toast of type toast
controller and then inside of our Sher
greeting function we can set this dot
toast dot create and as you can see that
this creates a new toast component we
can pass through in message and this is
simply the message that will appear on
screen and for the message I will say
before going any further and sure to add
back ticks when we add the string here
and a back tick is next to one on a
Windows keyboard and is said on in Mac
keyboards we can simply say hello and
then if we use the dollar sign and two
braces we can actually pass then at that
name and that's known as a template
literal string inside of es6 previously
we would have had to change this to be
hello and then added a plus sign and
then added our variable after but this
just makes it that much more powerful
and more concise finally we can also add
a duration for our toast and I'm going
to add at all of three seconds that's
3,000 milliseconds and then we can add
dot present this will surely toss the
instance to the user so that when they
hear that your greeting button they are
then given that toast on screen let's
take luck in our application if we type
Paul Halliday once again and click show
greeting we do get hello Paul however so
this is a very simple mobile application
but hopefully you can see
how powerful ionic is and how simple has
been to make this up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
