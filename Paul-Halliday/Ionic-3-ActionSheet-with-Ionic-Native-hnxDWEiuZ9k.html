look at creating native action sheets
with our ionic applications so to get
started I've made a new ionic project by
saying ionic start action sheet blank
I'm now going to add the ionic Cordova
plugin for Cordova plug-in action sheet
you may find that the CLI plugin for
Cordova
is not installed simply install that and
the installation will continue
we can now install the ionic native
wrapper by seeing NPM install ionic
native slash action sheet you will need
to add - - C if you are not running NPM
five and above now that we've installed
our dependencies we can of course open
this up inside of vs chords
thing that we need to do is head over to
up module dot es and we need to import
action sheet but instead of importing it
from ionic angular we need to import
that from ionic native slash action
sheet
to add this to the list of providers so
that we can use this throughout our
component do be aware that you're
importing this from ionic native because
ionic itself does have an action sheet
component so don't get these two
confused now I've done that I'm going to
head over to home tes as this is the
playground for our action sheet
component let's start off by making a
new action sheet and we can inject that
from our ionic native slash action sheet
so so far everything's quite standard
it's the same as any other ionic native
plugin and we can start off by making a
function and that function can be called
Shore action sheet so if we just start
off by taking a look at the API we can
see that we can choose some different
themes for our Android device when it
comes to showing the action sheet we can
customize this with some action sheet
options so let's take a look at that we
have things like different button labels
a title subtitle themes and more so as
we know we'll be dealing with some
action sheet options let's and pour that
from ionic native slash action sheet
some options by saying const options of
type action sheet options and if we now
hit control space we can see the
different options that we can select so
let's make a title the title will be my
action sheet let's make a subtitle now
and then subtitle will be select an
option now we have the option to add
some button at labels so if we take a
look at some button labels and we'll
first off add a comment here saying the
action sheet customization we're saying
if our action sheet pops up what
different buttons that we want to
display to the user so what's the labels
for that buttons and you'll notice that
the only mandatory thing here as
everything else has this Elvis operator
is this button labels so everything else
could be emitted it's all optional apart
from the labels so for our button labels
we will assume that potentially we're
looking to share something on Facebook
on Twitter on reddit or something like
that so we'll create a shared feature so
share on Facebook share on Twitter share
on reddit so what else do we have we
have things like add a cancel button
with the level of and we can simply
leave that to be canceled we have things
also like a destructive button so a
destructive button is usually used if
you want to give the user an option to
delete something it will give it some
different style and we'll see that if we
simply say delete
and ourselves an Android theme
take a look at the different Android
themes we have things like same
traditional holo dark holo light and
device dark and device light let's add a
holo dark for now so would be this
action sheet Android themes and we can
select either one so let's select that
dark theme we also have the ability to
set the destructive button to be the
last button let's select that to be true
we can also do things like enabling a
comfort button on Android or Windows
Phone as well as adding a position for
an iPad so this sets the X&amp;amp;Y position
if we're relatively happy with these
options we can then say this dot action
sheet dot hide offshore let's start with
sure
through the options and when a user
selects the action sheet so sure action
sheet with options and when a user
selects an action button what happens is
we get a button index based on what
button the user selected so this will be
apparent in a second but I'm going to
make this function async and we'll add a
try/catch surrounding this will log out
any RS and we'll assign the variable for
the selected button index by making a
Const selected button index equal to the
width this the action sheet not sure and
then of course we're passing in these
options so essentially now any button
that the user clicks will reside inside
the selected button index so we can log
out now to the console the user selected
and then we'll make a template string to
show the selected button index
side of our home to HTML so a quick
change of the title for action sheets
also add some color and inside of the
iron content we will make if button so
button will simply say sure action
sheets with the iron button attributes
the block attributes and be clear
attribute well finally add a click event
and that click events will be sure
action sheet if we've done everything
correctly we now should be able to run
this on the device and when the user
selects a button we can log the selected
button index to the console so let's
take a look at this in action we can run
ionic cordova run androids dash l this
can be of course any platform you want
it seems to be supported on Android the
web browser iOS Windows and Windows
Phone 8 so it's supported on a variety
of platforms and if we hit enter we
should then be able to see the results
of this inside of our application if we
select your action sheet
you can see that we get the ability to
share on Facebook on Twitter on reddit's
Alt Delete
if I select something like share on
Facebook
we can see inside of our JavaScript
console that the user selected one fire
to do the same and select - such as
share on Twitter we do gets the user
selected - so as you can see we've now
created an action sheet with ionic
native that we can display inside of our
applications
go ahead and change this theme so if we
selected theme hollow light and stats
our application would be updated to
instead ashore in late theme we could
also change this to be themed device
default dark and as you can see if I
select your action sheet again we now
get this dark theme based on the devices
be fault theme so play around with the
different themes and of course to take
action on any of these button indexes it
would be as simple as saying switch
selected button index and then adding a
kiss for one two and so on so that's how
we create an action sheet now the
comment to say to take action use if
switch statements so that's how we
integrate the action sheet inside of our
ionic applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
