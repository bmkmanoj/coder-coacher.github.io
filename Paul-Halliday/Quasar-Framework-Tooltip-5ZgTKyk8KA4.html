look at using the tooltips inside of our
quasar framework projects I've created a
new quiz or project and I'll be having
to our hello dot view inside of source
slash components inside of here I'll be
removing everything inside of this file
and we'll be making in new templates
we'll also be making a new script and
exporting a default object the first
thing we'll do inside of our script is
import from the quiz our framework or
simply quiz on the cue button and the
cue tool tab this allows us to add the
cue button to our template so let's add
a cue - button and the Tilted does
actually have to be the direct child of
whatever components you wish to show the
tooltip on so if we want to show this
inside of the button it has to be the
next director child so for example if
this button said something like submit
we could make this top-level by saying
cue tool tab let's add a particular tool
tab by saying submit form perhaps the
user is filling out this form to
continue let's also define the
components which were using and there's
the cue button and the cue tool tab
take a look inside of our project and we
hover over our button we can instantly
see that we have this filter saying
submit a form to continue if we still
wish we can add some props to this by
saying call on delay because we can a
dead girl err
let's add for example a two-second delay
and now when we hover over the button we
shouldn't see anything for two seconds
and then our filter will appear after
that time as you've seen your tool
played but now it does appear after that
two seconds all the properties as such
as the anchor and self can be used here
to anchor it to either be the bottom
left or something like self which can be
of course the top left could also do
something like an offset and the offset
includes an array with two numbers the
first one being a horizontal offset and
the second being a vertical if we point
100 hundred into this array we can see
that after two seconds we do get the
offset of a hundred or Thora's on tool
and vertical to our tool pet we can add
things like disable equal to be true and
if we are be disabled through an our
tool tip no matter how long we hover
over the button the pop-up will not
appear if we do then set this to false
as an example we could also add
something like the max height so if we
use must height may be something like 10
pixels just to be dust we would of
course have to add this as a string so I
have surrounded this with quotation you
can then see that our tooltip no longer
stretches to the width of that tooltip
instead the max height is 10 pixels I do
have everything too zoomed in here so
that's why it still looks way more than
10 pixels as far as methods go we do
have things like toggle open and clause
that about covers everything for the
tooltips inside of the quiz our
framework
don't forget had that subscribe button
to still did with more content and of
course check out Paul Halliday do I
offer more courses free content and much
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
