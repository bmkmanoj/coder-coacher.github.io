at Emmett's as a way to vastly improve
our HTML and CSS workflow as you know my
favorite editor is vs cord so let's look
at how we can enable Emmett inside of vs
cords while the start worth Emmett is
automatically enabled but there are a
few settings that I'd like to add such
as Emmet don't trigger expansion on tab
equal to true and another one watches
Emmet dot sure suggestions as snippets I
liked for that to true and then we can
use the editor dot snippet suggestions
equal to top these are just a few
settings that I like to use when I'm
using Emmet inside of Visual Studio code
if we wanted to we could enable Emma for
other languages such as Jed's but at
this point in time we'll simply like it
how we can get started with Emmett's now
that we're setting up our environments
so what is Emmet well let's just simply
make a div with a class of my div well
that took us a few seconds to type out
but we could do this much simpler inside
of vs cord and Emmett's by simply using
dot for the class and then the name of
our class you'll notice now that we have
this pop-up and this is Emmet
abbreviation div class is equal to my
div and what we need to do now is hit
tab and that will simply give us the
same text for example a div with the
class of my div as before so if you used
to standard development where we simply
type everything out manually you can see
already how much time and effort was
spending we could also do things with an
ID so if we delete this we could use the
hash tag for simply an ID and already
you can see that Emmet is suggesting it
div with the ID of something if we add
an idea of header for example we could
head tub and already we have a new div
with the ID of header when I simply
limited to only using dibs though we
could have a pee
for a paragraph with the class of para
and when we hit tab we now get the class
with para on our P tag and this can go
for a variety of different elements so
if we had any elements such as a form we
could have an ID of my - form and a
class of potentially full-length and
when that we tab out here we get the
form with an ID of my form and the class
at full width so already I think you can
tell right now that Emmett is definitely
worth your time as far as learning so
all of this here can be characterized as
ID and class attributes and that's
simply done by using the class of my div
using the ID of hash header we'll move
this one up to the class of paragraph
and this one is a form with both the ID
of my form and the class of full-length
now I want to look at how we can make
children elements inside of the Dom so
if we for example add a navigation
element and that had an unordered list
and a list item we could use the nav and
then if we use the greater than sign
then I was asked to make an item one
component down so if we had a ul you can
see that Emmet is telling us right here
that we have this nav and then a ul and
if we did the same we then have an Li
if we hit tab you can see it's generated
us a navigation elements with a ul and
an Li but what if we wanted to make
multiple Li well that's something we'll
look at in more detail in a moment but
for now we can see now if we simply use
the UL go down one enter an Li and then
we use the multiplication the asterisk
for as many as we want so if we said
four you'd see that we have four Li
elements let's now take a look at how we
can make sibling
elements so this would be for example a
div then a P tag and then perhaps
something like a span well in order to
achieve the same result we could use dev
and then a plus sign for that P tag and
that a plus sign again for that span you
can see in our Emmett's abbreviation
that we have a div a P and then a spun
and if we hit tab we get the same chords
another thing that this does for us is
at this moment in time our cursor is
selected inside of the div if we were to
type something such as hello and then we
press the tab key we automatically go
down to the next element another thing
that this does is that it's centers our
cursor on the text part of our div so we
can either elect to add more elements
inside or if we simply type to something
like hello and then we hit tab we now go
into the P tag and that text element so
we now we could say a world and if we
hit tab again we now get inside of the
span in which we could perhaps at
another P and inside of that we can add
a smiley face so this is a lot of time
when we're creating multiple elements
and we know exactly what's going to go
in the middle let's combine these things
together so if we had a div and
underneath that we had another div but
inside of that had a paragraph tag and
then perhaps inside of the paragraph tag
itself it had a block port and we'll
look at how we can shorten there so we
don't have to type our block quote in a
second but then if we wanted to use the
up-arrow we could then add an e/m and
what this does is it shifts the e/m up
one so you'll notice now if we hit tab
we have this very strange Dom elements
but we initially started with a div and
then we have a div which has a P a block
were inside of that P
but then instead of the e/m coming after
our dev we are shifting it up one so
let's return to that snipper and
investigate a further if for example I
used a plus you'll see that our eeehm
would actually be inside of this
paragraph tag so what we're doing is
we're essentially shifting it up so it's
outside of that P element we could do
the same if we tuck our block quotes and
shift it up twice and then we had our am
you'll now see that it's outside of the
P element and it's also outside of the
div so now have a div which has a div
with a P a blockquote and div and then
the e/m but perhaps you don't want to
type this block quote every time instead
we could use BQ and that would give us
block quotes we could do things like BTN
for the Emmett abbreviation for a button
other things like BTN call on B or call
on our or even call on s gives us
different types so if we said BTN call
on D we'd have a disable button call on
s would be type submit' and bt n : r
would simply be type reset so you can
now see that not only can we abbreviate
a variety of different things but also
we can infer their type with a colon so
this spans out to everything from inputs
if we had an input of type text we could
use inputs call on text this fills us
with an ID and a name as well should we
wish but we have inputs of buttons
checkbox color everything you'd need so
when we want to infer a type of
something we do use that : we can
continue our journey and let's take a
look at things like multiplication and
also numbering our items so we locked a
multiplication earlier on when we had ul
that had
specific amount of allies using the UL
they gretel-ann
Ally and then timesing it by 10 as you
can see we have a variety of different
allies tend to be specific we can also
take this further and give this Ally a
particular class name so if we had a ul
with an Li we can give this a class
using the dot syntax so if this was
Lester - item and then we times two by
five this would give us five separate
allies with the class of list item but
also if we wanted to give these things
an ID so if we went to ul Li and now
instead of using the dot syntax we could
give a item with a hash tag we could use
the dollar syntax and that would give us
a particular ID number when we go to use
the asterisk five as you can see in our
abbreviation we then have item 1 2 3 4 &amp;amp;
5 all of these things have been
generated for us when we use Emmet if we
want to add our beads to our elements we
can also do that for example if we had a
specific needs to have a h1 we could
then use the array like syntax with our
square brackets to perhaps give this and
attribute perhaps we had something like
size and that would be equal to 10 and
if we use times 4 you'd see that we'd
have an arrow Butte of size equal to 10
and obviously does nothing at this point
but it simply just shows us that we
could add multiple arrow beads on
multiple elements we could also take
advantage of counters so in a similar
way than we did before
you'll notice that we have this dollar
element and the doll element allows us
to for example say H dollar and if we
said times 2 times 3 you could see that
we have this h1 h2 h3 so the dollar is
automatically inferring that number and
adding it to our abbreviation
so when we use H dollar times four that
gives us a hedge 1 H 2 H 3 and H 4 so we
could even take this further by using
huge dollar and that would use one two
or three when we come to multipliers we
could add a particular variable such as
size and that could be also equal to the
dollar which is that incremental we
could increment this by five that would
give us a hedge 1 H 2 H 3 and so on with
the attributes have also that number not
terribly useful at this point in time
but you can see that this can be done
with the accumulator now we can also add
text to our elements if we want so if we
had H 1 we could then use the curly
braces so the object like syntax and
inside of here we could bind header text
and when we do that and we expand our
abbreviation we get the h1 with the
header text like so we could also add an
accumulator here if we had the header
text and I'm gonna add a dash for a
dollar and then all we need to do is
simply times that by however many we
want so if we had 3 we'd have three
header texts with that dollar so I hope
you can see the power of that
accumulator and that's how we would use
it to generate a variety of different
elements when it comes to things like
text we could do the same thing as
before so we could have a pea with the
braces of hello world and this will give
us some text with hello world
when it comes to using text we could
also up by inter P and set hello we
could add an ear elements inside of our
P could also do things like world and
when we expand this we have a P that
says hello we then have an ear type with
the text of world and then it ends our P
other things we can do in HTML we want
to generate a need document we could you
simply use doc and that generates us a
new HTML document it gives us a title
and gives us the appropriate meta tags
and so on I think we can do is use the
HTML and also HTML code 5 we have very
similar response if not the same but the
tooling doesn't stop at HTML we can also
head over to a CSS file and inside of
CSS we have things for example if we had
a class of my header and inside of here
we could do things like posts for
position and as soon as we tab that we
get position:relative if we use to a
pause and a colon we could use post : s
and that gives us position static other
things like air for absolute you can see
how this continues there are all the
different variables for position other
things like backgrounds gives us what
the BG for the abbreviation other things
like margin we can have for m 10 for
margin 10 and this can be extended for
any number so if we add m 22 it will
give us a margin of 22 pixels the same
goes for padding for P 20 DN also gives
us things like displaying on DB for
things like display:block and so on you
can imagine the so many tags for Emmet's
in CSS and in HTML take advantage of all
of these abbreviations and you can sure
save a lot of time when it comes to your
daily dated their tasks in HTML and CSS
another thing I did forget as far as our
HTML goes is that we can also group
elements so if we for example had a div
and we wanted to group elements inside
of this dev so for example we have
elements that we want to contain in one
container we could surround our dev
inside of these parens and this then
allows us to add other elements for
example if we had a ul and an Li we now
have a ul and an ally inside of our dev
we could then continue to potentially
add another div outside of this dev
which then has things like a P a span
and a variety of other content if we hit
tab on this you can see that we then
have this nested div which does have
things like a UI and an Li inside of its
so we've grouped that together but then
we also have another div which has a P
and a span inside all as part as the
same initial abbreviation we could add
classes at any points to these things so
my span potentially give this an ID of
my paragraph once we tap this out you
can see that these things have IDs and
classes so hopefully I don't need to
convince you anymore but Emmet's is
awesome and you should be using the
