different we're going to make in native
script application and we're going to
integrate SMS and phone calls within
that so start off by firstly if you
haven't already by installing the native
script CLI do this by running NPM
install native scripts - of G then we
can creates our first native script
application this one is a little long so
just Hana run at TNS creates SMS form
that's going to be the name of our
project then we want to probably
templates like so - slash templates then
native scripts - templates - ng -
tutorial that's essentially going to
create a blank native script and Giller
- of run that if everything went
successfully you should get project SMS
form was successfully created awesome we
can CD into that directory now for CD
SMS form and now we need to add the
native script form plug-in to do that
simply run TNS plug-in add native script
- form awesome let's open up NBS code so
the structure of a native script output
is very similar to that of an ionic app
and an angular app because it runs
annular - as you can tell we have an app
modules or TS here and that component TS
and also an app CSS here let's start off
by going to our app component es and
filling out our UI essentially I want
two buttons and two forms now which is
implement a select here we could do a
variety of different things but I just
want to keep this super simple the first
thing we're going to do is change my up
to near the script SMS and form then
we're going to start filling out our UI
so we need we call is static layout and
that's essentially makes everything
stuck on top of each other and we're
going to give this the class of T 20
adds 20 pixels of padding and then I'm
going to add a level which the level is
simply going to see it select either
text or for no to continue so by the end
of this we should have used a variety
different components such as layouts
buttons levels and so on
next we want a flexbox valve and the
flexbox layout allows us to have two
buttons next to each other one of these
buttons is going to have the text of
fawn and the other buttons will have the
text of message so when somebody clicks
the phone button I want they a form to
appear which is going to be simply if
phone number that was going and when
somebody clicks the message button
I want another form to appear and that's
going to have a phone number and a
message too so let's start building out
these forms
we'll need into the stack way out for
this and within our first circle which
is going to be our form
we'll simply need a text field for the
phone number and this is going to be the
keyboard type of thorn so this
specifically the input light when
somebody clicks the text field we won't
get a normal keyboard fill and spread to
get form keyboards the hint which is
basically place all the text and one is
what enter form the number next we need
a button and when somebody taps the
button we're going to call call number
the text of our button will simply say
call and now we can start building the
text message form so we once a is stuck
way out again and this time but we want
the phone number text field appear but
we also want a message field
so this one is simply going to say enter
message the keyboard type here is going
to be text and we'll need a button
instead of call number it will say a
text number and the text of run or fair
text so now we need a way to get the
info from the user so we'll need to get
the phone number we'll need to get a
text message to do that we'll use ng
model in order to import and use ng
model with their native scripts we have
to go to output module TS then we can
import native script forms module from
native script angular slash forms
we then have to put it on our imports
here and then we can use ngmodel within
our components so inside our component
here I'm going to make a couple of
variables one which is phone number and
that's going to be a type number and the
other one is text message and it's a
type string we can add the model to our
text field by simply using ng model is
equal to phone number and I've got a
copy test base to the other field down
in the other stack layout this means if
somebody enters their phone number on
that the phone button if we toggle over
to message the phone number will be kept
we'll also need a model for the text
message so simply use text message and
now we need to fill out our functions so
a call number this is simply going to
return void and whisk call number we can
do for not dial and then we need to pass
a number and an operating system
confirmation to start without we need to
import a spawn from a native script form
then we can access our for know dial
function by using simply phone dial and
then as you can see it requires n number
so we'll cast our number to a string so
use string of this platform number and
then we'll pass the operand system
confirmation dialog here to true we can
see if we look at the interface that
requires a number and in operating
system specific confirmation before
dialing so that's the whole call number
working is if the user clicks the call
number button after typing the phone of
run here it should call the next thing
to do is to make the text number
function and that's going to return a
promise and this one requires an array
so we're going to use a fondle SMS and
then it's an array of numbers so we cast
our number yes again to a string so this
is a phone number and if we wanted to
add to multiple numbers here we we
totally codes but we only have one in
our model at the moment so after that
we're simply going to pass this dot text
message after that we can
log the result and we can also catch any
errors that we may have awesome so all
we need to do now is set up a toggle
event so if somebody tells before this
disappears and assembly toggles be
message this disappears
I'm going to add a new variable and this
one is going to be forum type and I'm
going to customer turn number four now
I'm going to add a new variable and this
one is going to be forum type and it's
going to be in number like I said
there's a variety of ways you can do
this but this is just going to be a
super simple example when somebody taps
these phone buttons it's going to set
the forum type to be zero when somebody
taps the message button you've got it
set to be one so inside of our function
here we can just make a quick function
that that changes the value of phone
type so set phone type the value of form
types are all going to do is for this
platform type is equal to the value and
now because of us we can do conditional
ng-if so ngf forum type is equal to zero
then we want to show this stack level
here and if the forum type is equal to
one we'll for sure best form so most
likely we want to hide this call number
button if the phone number hasn't been
entered so we simply add an gif phone
number and this means this button will
not sure and that something has been
added inside the phone number box
obviously in production you might want
to do it for a specific mode of numbers
and so on so they're the same here for
the bottom text number but instead we'll
do a phone number and text message then
show D button so we head over to upload
CSS we can change our CSS import to
instead be sky ocss it's going to import
a blue color which we can use our navbar
and to do that we simply give the action
bar the class of actions dash bar then I
want to give these four buttons and B
text buttons their own unique color to
do that with simply going to make a
classic form button and the background
color of which is going to be two ECC
seven one now the color of the text
white and we'll also have the text
button to be a nice blue so background
color will make it 3 4 9 8 DB the color
of the text will be white then inside of
our component here we can give our
buttons the particular class so this one
is performed by and this one here is the
text button and inside of our button T
again we can add the same class so to
run this on the device we need to with
our terminal and we can use TNS that run
Android iOS or whatever platform you'd
like to run it on so you finally made
your first native scripts phone app or
maybe you've already used native script
before and you simply want to add phone
numbers and text messaging I hope this
has helped if it has I'd love you to hit
