at what generators are inside of es6 now
you can think as generators as functions
that can be paused and resumed let's
take a look at the syntax and how we can
make our first a generator so if we make
a new function named my generator at
first it looks like s done that function
but to make it into a generator we have
to add this star so let's add an
asterisk after the function keywords
after that we can give the user a
variety of different values over time by
using the yield keywords so if we said
yield one yields two and yield three
when we call the dot next on this
function we will initially get the value
of one and only one we call B dot next
again will we get two and three so let's
take a look at this in more detail now
you may think that the whether we do
this would be to call my generator and
then add dot next if we log this out to
the console you'll see that we do indeed
get the value of one but if we take this
and we run again you'll notice that we
get one in both instances so this is not
actually what we want what we want to do
instead is capture that generator object
so let's make a new generator object and
that's equal to our my generator
function then inside of our object we
can log out the generator object next
you'll notice what we have the value of
one and if we do the same now we get the
value of two and value of three inside
of our return object we also get a dumb
keywords and if we want to be value only
we'd have to do next and then of course
I would don't value and essentially what
this is is an iterator so the iterator
gives us the value and be done
you'll notice that if we try and do it
next to once more the value becomes
undefined and done is equal to true and
this is because our generator object has
normal values to yield per us so
essentially we've got the values one two
and three and there's no more after that
instead of returning undefined we can
also return an actual value so if we are
to return this is the final value your
modest that our generator is updated
here at the bottom after logging out one
two and three the final value is the
current string here this is the final
value we also get done equal to true so
that's essentially how we can use
generators inside of es6 we can use it
to step through and yield different
values over time so this makes it really
good for in synchronous operations and
we can check to see whether we're done
with our boolean which is done equal to
false or true and of course provide F
final value there's quite a bit more
depth that you can get into with the
generators and iterators but this should
serve as a good introduction if you
