ionic Club to view our eye on a couple
occasions on a variety of different user
interface styles this means we can lock
an hour up as if it was run on an iOS
device an Android device and a Windows
device to view whether this is not
actual emulation it's the same as
running ionic serve but we just get to
see all three devices or user interfaces
at the same time so let's run ionic Club
from within and ionic project now the
project I'm currently in ionic buttons
is an ionic project and when I hit enter
it will start the project as usual when
we run ionic serve but this time it runs
I on a collab as you can see when we go
ahead and do this we get a different
user interface and it starts off by
showing us the Android device as you can
see it's a blank ionic application and
if we head over to platforms at the top
right we can select iPhone which gives
us our application under iOS and Windows
which gives us our application inside of
a windows for new UI so this allows you
to determine the platform differences
and the user interface of your project
and you can also have different benefits
- for example if we hit this side menu
at the top left we get access to quick
reference for the components API
reference ionic native and of course all
documentation we're given the name of
our application here which is my app and
the current version don't forget you can
change that and also quick links to the
Twitter for ionic the documentation the
ionic forum and so on we can also should
we wish to hit the open fullscreen
button next to platforms here this will
give us the standard ionic serve NFS so
under Android UI and we can also right
click and hit inspect from here we can
pull up the toolbar a little bit and
then hit view the device to a bar so
this
Goolsbee device 2 1 if we click that
we're in a similar situation where at
the top here we can select a variety of
different devices if we want to view it
as iPhone six-plus we can leave it like
that and then if we here to refresh
inside of Chrome it will change the user
interface too much iOS so that's how we
can run our ionic applications but also
view it under a numerous amount of
different operating systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
