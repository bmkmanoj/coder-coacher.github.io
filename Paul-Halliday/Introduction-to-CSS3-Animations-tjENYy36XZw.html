create a very simple css3 animation I
essentially want to fit in this title so
when the user navigates to our web page
the title or fed in from Anna pasady 0
to Anna pasady 1 it's supposed to be a
very gentle introduction to keyframe
animation inside of css3
so here we have a very standard HTML
document it contains the HTML tag the
head tag and the body tag inside of the
body tag we have a h1 with the class of
animators let's add some Styles inside
of our head tag now I would advise that
you put this in a separate file inside
of your application this is just for
demonstration purposes and the first
thing that we need to do is define a
keyframe so what we're doing when we're
defining a keyframe is defining the
different stages of animation that our
project will go through so in this stage
we can say I've keyframes and then we
need to give a name to this particular
keyframes and this keyframe will be fed
in this allows us to feed something from
a particular value to a particular value
so it's as simple as thing from a pasady
0 to a pasady 1 now it's very
declarative or essentially saying that
we won't go from not being able to see
this item at all to actually seeing it
on-screen
we don't have to define generations or
anything like that at this point all we
have to do now is either target out here
John directly or alternatively put's
don't animated for our class in this
circumstance either one is fine and then
inside of our animated class what we
want to do is say the animation name
that's the name of the animation that
we'll be using and of course that name
is fed in and the generation of our
animation can be story seconds
you will find that it is as simple as
that we already have the class here on
our h1 and all the same thing is that we
want to go from a pasty viewer to a
pasty one if we refresh our web page we
can see that it feeds in from 0 to 1
over the three seconds duration so this
is cool have gone from a value to a
value but we can also do things at
particular set percentages for example
here and I'll fit in we can make a new
animation
this one will be keyframes and we'll
call us one cycle color and at 0% we
will see the color of our text will be
black 25% we can add the color of the
text to be blue 50% we can change that
to be read at 75% we can change that
color to instead be something like blue
violet and at a hundred percent we can
set our color to be something like coral
so what I do know is cycling through
those different colors and the different
percentages of our animation so instead
of saying that we want to use the
animated name of fed in we can say that
instead we want to use the cycle color
if we refresh our page we can see that
we go from those different colors over
from black all the web see blue coral
and so on we did find that that that was
quite quick so let's change that to
instead be 6 seconds and
as you can see we have this very slaw
animated tax mail which cycles through
the different colors what if we wanted
to display this twice well we certainly
could let's change that to have an
animation iteration count and we can
change that to be two also going to
change the direction to be three seconds
so we should have a very similar
functionality of that six second
animation as it should iterate over this
twice so let's refresh this we see go
through until hits the coral in which it
goes black and through to the coral once
more but what if we wanted our animation
to instead run forever well we certainly
could we can change this from two to
instead the infinite and when we refresh
our page we can see that our animation
does continuously cycle through
infinitely we also have some fun things
like changing the animation Direction
animation direction can be set to
reverse and what that will do is take it
from coral to blue violets then red then
blue then blank if we save this you can
see it does go from coral all wet to the
black and all continue to cycle as we
set this to be infinite the fun does not
stop there though because we can also
change the animation direction to be
alternate now alternate initially plays
in the normal direction so that runs
fast forward then backwards and forward
and so on you can also do the cinema
instead to the alternate reverse which
starts off backwards then forward at
Sarah if we wanted to change the way in
which our timing works we could set an
animation timing function and that
function can be different things like
even and that can also be things like
even out it can be linear and so on
things like even give us is slow start
ease out give us is slow end ease in and
out
give us a slow start and a slow ends a
linear speed
just the same speed throughout the
animation and if we set this to ease
what this does is we have a slow start
then it goes fast and ends slowly this
is the default animation and if you
really want it you can define your own
with a cubic Bezier this can essentially
be done by passing for values like this
as well as that we don't have to define
these individually what we can do is
remove this and we could make a similar
function but instead set animation and
we can pass in the current name which
would be cycle color then we need to
pass in the duration so for example 5
seconds we could also set the timings
function which would be something like
even we also didn't look at this what we
can also set a delay and this delay will
be prior to the animation starting
itself if we wanted to do that we could
say animation - delay and potentially
set up to something like 2 seconds but
we will add the 2 second delay inside of
our animation declaration here after
that we need to define how much we want
to iterate this for so we could go back
to using infinite and finally we can
also set a direction so let's set this
one to alternate so as you can see here
we'll set an animation name with the
short run syntax which is the cycle
color the duration which is currently 5
seconds
the timing function which is currently
even the delay at 2 seconds the
iteration count which is infinite and
the direction which is alternate if we
save this you can see that we have that
animation it was initially delayed by 2
seconds and then it cycles through the
different colors so I hope this provides
you with a decent introduction at least
to css3 animations I should also add
that you're not restricted to only using
be one rule we could also add something
here like a background color or
something like yellow
and maybe the blue could have a
background color of something like red
and so on if we then refresher this you
can see that we have that different
color background color as well as the
different color texture as the animation
cycles through so hope you found this
guide on css3 animations useful if you
have let me know what you think inside
of the comment section below don't
forget to check out Paul Halliday Dorai
or for more courses free content and
much more I also have a periodic you
want to spoil the content check out
outside of the description and thank you
very much for watching I'll see you very
soon in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
