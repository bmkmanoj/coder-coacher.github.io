our index sanction is to have a main
element and that allows us to define the
main content body and inside of men we
can use what is known as a for each loop
that's done with these squiggly braces
once again and this time we have a hash
for H and this time we want to do if for
each over posts as we have access to
this posts variable when we want to nd
for each we do the squiggly braces again
but this time / voyage you must make
sure that there's actually no spaces
between this one simply put no spaces at
the end and at the front so just to make
things super simple we'll just have a h1
and we'll bind to the title so at this
point in time we are saying for each one
of the posts display the title hopefully
you see it's not too complex at this
point if we then refresh the page you
can see that we have currently three
different posts but why do we only have
three well that's because in our
package.json we said our config should
only have three posts per page if we
wanted to change this to be any more
we'd have to change this to for example
B 5 and we'd have to run cost start and
cost stop because any changes to the
package.json only looked at at this
start of cost so we're now able to
display posts on screen but I wanna look
at the other posts I know there's more
than three and we're showing three per
page so surely we must be aware to
display a Next button let's take a look
at that in the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
