integrating progress bars with the
Balmer CSS framework so let's add nu
progress elements with the class of
progress we can give this F value for
example 20% the value in this
circumstance is a textual value but
we'll also have to add F value for the
bar itself and that as a simple
numerical number doesn't include the
percent sign and then we have to tell
her what the max is so say that the max
is a hundred and once again this is a
number without a percent sign as you can
see there is our standard progress bar
sitting at 20% let's copy this for each
one of our colors when we've got from 20
to 30 but this time we'll use the is
primary class so now we have a primary
colored progress bar and is standard
colored progress bar let's do the same
for our other colors such as is info
this time with 35% imagine see we now
have a blue progress bar as well if we
also add is success maybe a 45 we get
the addition of our green progress bar
we can also add warning this time maybe
it's something like 65% and the warning
is a yellow bar and let's add is danger
for the final color at a hundreds so if
we take a look now at making another
progress bar but this time we add both
the progress class and the is small
class I'm going to give this the value
of 50 just so we can see it and the max
of 100 like so and you mind if you tell
us that it is definitely smaller than
the initial bar if we did the same and I
will simply say small bar and these are
coloreds progress bars
so therefore in normal bar must be
progress with the class of progress and
we can give this one a value of maybe
something
a little smaller so as you can see it's
a normal bar with the value of 30%
let's do once more so progress dot and
we can add is medium this time
as well as the progress class so this
one will be slightly bigger let's add at
sixty and the max of a hundreds
see that is definitely slightly bigger
than at the normal size
and for a significantly bigger bar we
can add is large
let's undervalue of Eddie and the max of
100 so as you can see now we have a
significantly bigger bar here with our
progress and don't forget if you want to
add a color to this all you need to do
is add the is primary or whatever color
you want to add now that's all the great
things that bulb Alma is it's super
simple to attach different colors a
touch different sizes and so on with
each one of the components so this is
just about everything to do with
progress bars inside of the Balmer CSS a
framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
