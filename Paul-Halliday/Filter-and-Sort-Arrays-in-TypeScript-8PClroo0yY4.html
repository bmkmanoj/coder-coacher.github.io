at sorting and filtering a data center
inside of JavaScript so I'm gonna have a
dataset which has an interface of people
rather an interface of person and each
person will have a name it will have an
edge and also a gender at this moment we
will simply put gender to be either 0 or
1 to keep things super simple so we now
have is simple and numeration we have an
interface and of course now we want a
list of people so that will of course be
a person array ok so as you can see on
screen I have a variety of different
items inside of our array and we of
course have edges all the way from 24 to
I think will be 64 talking about edges
let's first off a filter between a
number of ages so let's a filter maybe
from 30 to 40 so how can we do that
let's make a constant called filter by
age and that will have of course a list
of people so let's put a min which is a
number and a max which is a number
alternatively we could place this inside
of a object it may be that perhaps if we
want to filter on sort of other
conditions in the future
as it turns out it is actually quite
simple from here all we need to do is
that people don't filter this then gives
us a person so we have each person and
we only want to return that person if
they meet particular criteria so let's
say that that person's age has to be
greater than equal to our range min and
also that person's age has to be less
than or equal to the range max so if we
took our filter by age function and we
said filtered by edge and that will be
equal to our filter by age or pass in
the people and an object which we'd even
create above we would then see that if
we log this out to the console we would
have a list of people that would be
filtered between 30 and 40 so here is
the results of this as you can see we
have gender we have John Papa all the
way to Donald Duck but at this stage
you'll notice that we could probably do
better here we are filtering these
people by age after all maybe we want to
have this going from 30 to 33 35 and so
on so that gives us the ability to then
think about how we might sort an array
so we maybe want to sort the array by
age so let's make it constant called
sort by age now I'll only take in two
people and essentially we want to sort
our array which has person ear
and person B and we want to determine
whether the person air age is greater
man a person B's edge if it is for a
turn one else otherwise we will return
at zero so how does this then luck in
practice let's make another Const sorted
by edge and that will be equal to sort
by edge and we'll pass in our people we
can then log be sorted by edge people
out look at the difference we then have
we have going from 24 to 30 all the way
to finally having 64 so we in now
sorting people by edge but if we wanted
to sort of filter these people to only
be heaped 30 and 40 and we also wanted
to sort them at the same time how could
we do that we have these two functions
that we've created can we compose these
functions easily let's have like let's
make a result and we'll start off by
filtering people by edge we'll have
people in men Max and when we get that
result we'll sort those people by edge
so it does this work as we expect let's
log that out to the console as you can
see yes it certainly does we have people
from 30 to 33 all the way to 40 at the
end here so at a glance this is how we
use the filter and sort function Zahn a
