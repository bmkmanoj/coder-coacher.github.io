relicensed their product to be MIT
licensed this also includes jest and
floor as well as a mutable tante GS the
previous license the BSD plus patents
license did cause some controversy
earlier this year and Apache removed
their support for react in any of their
projects this has also seen people flock
to frameworks like view GS and even
wordpress.com
stated that they weren't going to use
react for the Gutenberg Project this is
a big deal and it did see people even
trying things like pre act because pre
act did have an MIT license but on chat
lawyers everywhere were stating that in
fact pre-act me potentially have that
bsd plus patents license problem because
obviously it's quite similar to react i
don't want to get into that at all i'm
certainly not a lawyer but that's
basically the controversy so the good
news is that now or react is MIT
licensed and everybody that wanted it to
be now gets to use it in their project
without having to worry about the
patents clause doobie whether even still
on the previous license companies like
microsoft apple and much more we're all
using react in production so it's up to
you it's your take on the license how it
affects you and your team but now with
the MIT license and it is much more
flexible so that's about it don't forget
endless subscribe button to stay updated
and check out Paul holiday don't I or if
you'd like to see more courses content
and I do actually have some react
content on the way so you may be
interested in that
until that time I'll see you soon in
that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
