sink in a way it's last month and I've
never got around to making the video on
it a lot of people ask me all the time
Paul you use air sink and a width in
your applications just about in every
video what an earth is it well I think
is effectively another way to write
promises so we can use air sink in a
word to write chord that looks
synchronous but actually it's resolving
air promise and is air synchronous let's
take a look at this in more detail I'm
going to run iron Xserve to run as a
project in the browser and then we'll
make a simple app that involves a
promise so as you can see we have a
blank ionic application then inside of
our source pages home don TS I'm then
going to make a function that function
will be called say hello and the
function will return in new promise so
we'll have a resolve and a reject and
all this promise is going to do is
resolve the words hello but it's going
to do that after three seconds so that
we have a we have a function that's
returning in new promise after three
seconds all that's saying is hello to
the user I'm going to hook into the ion
view did enter lifecycle hook and we'll
run see hello you'll notice that right
now we can run a dot then and if we take
the data and simply log I'll be data to
the console we should get hello in our
console so our app has loaded and after
three seconds we should get hello and we
did so let's make the way that we
interact with say hello in an
asynchronous where perhaps the best way
to show this would be to make a new
provider so let's make an ionic G
provider and we'll call it hell or
service if we then add the hello service
to our project in app module we can
import from providers hello serviced or
TS and then we can add hello service to
the list of providers
let's now take our hello function and
move it to our health service for now we
can also get rid of the imports that we
don't need and then we can import from
providers
/hello service we can import to and
inject our hello service so let's say a
private hello hello service and we can
make a new function but this time the
function will be a sync
so let's say a sync gets hello
because we're getting the hello message
and async functions have to use a wait
so a width is just essentially the same
as running this but instead of saying
dot then data is then logged out to the
console we could then say for me this a
constant and fear greeting is equal to
be resolved promise of this dot hello
don't say hello we no longer need B then
call because the cord after say hello
will not be run until we promise as
resolved to prove this let's make some
console log statements and gotta say I'm
only going to run after say hello is
finished
let's also console.log the greeting so
when the view enters let's start the
countdown that should be three seconds
so it will start it time out and resolve
the words hello after three seconds we
should get the value inside of our
homepage
after that we'll log it out and then
we'll also prove that this code does not
run until say hello is finished by
saying I'm only going to run after say
hello is finished let's take a look at
how this executes inside of the browser
so make sure you saved your file and
then inside of our ionic app we've just
refreshed the page and you can see we
only get I'm only going to run after say
hello is finished after the promise is
resolved so it's essentially the same is
doing this hello say hello dot then
taking the data putting the dead or
equal to three thing is equal to data so
let's make greeting up here and we'll
see it's a string then we can log out be
greeting and only then would we run the
this is only going to run after say
hello is finished so if we run this
again we should see the exact same
result
we'd also have to get rid of the air
sink call and one that's builds
we get nothing then we get hello then we
get our I'm only going to run after say
hello is finished this allows us to
refactor our chords and we can use the
ax with a sync pattern to write cleaner
chord without going into callback help
let's go over it one more time so we'll
have async Gettle then we can make a
value such as greeting
equal to this hello say hello and
greeting will now be what's ever
resolved by that promise when we add the
key word a width and then only things
after a width will be run so this will
be run at this order as this takes three
seconds after the three seconds record B
law will execute and this takes three
seconds because we've added a time out
of three seconds in the service it would
take for as long as it needs for the
promised to resolve so identical to dot
then but instead we're writing cleaner
cords by using the awake keywords here
we know that this called underneath is
not executed until it's resolved or
rejected so I advise you to start using
the S Inc aware pattern within your
ionic code and you will find yourself
for it because it makes you called that
much more readable if you'd like to
learn more about air sink and other
concepts don't forget to check out the
learn ionic 3 from scratch course over
at udemy simply type it in it to the
search bar or check the description for
a link I've got a discount cord running
at the moment so if you purchase it now
you'll get it while the course is super
cheap my name is full thanks for
watching I will see you in the next
