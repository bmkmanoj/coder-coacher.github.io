view these items we want to head over to
the home don TS file inside of here I
want to add a private shopping and
that'll be a reference to our shopping
list service so me to import this once
again so inside of here we can then
create a shopping list a dollar and this
will just represent an observable so in
order to use an observable we'll need to
import that from our XG s slash
observable so that will be an observable
list of items so we need to also import
our items from our item model
and then inside of the constructor or
you could do this inside of a lifecycle
hug kids on to you we could said this
don't shopping Lester dollar is equal to
this dot shopping and on our shopping I
want to get to the shopping list so that
returns us a list of shopping items but
here I also want to get these snapshot
changes because the snapshot changes
allows us to get both the key and the
value
if we just wanted the values themselves
we could get the value changes but as
we've got to be using the keys in the
future we're going to use the snapshot
changes methods we could then map these
items which it returns us a list of
changes and for each change we want to
return a changes dot map whereas we have
a new object that returns us a key with
the payload key and then the spread
operator to also return the payloads dot
Val
lots of a quake like at what exactly
this is doing so we're starting off by
saying this don't shopping dog get a
shopping list so this returns us a DB
list honor that database list were
saying hey get me the snapshot changes
which gives us both the key and value
pairs or rather it gives us access to
these things so then what we're doing is
we're mapping over these changes and
we're saying hey for each one of these
changes I want to return a new object
and it's important when we're using the
arrow syntax to return an object and
nothing else we have to wrap this inside
of parentheses so what exactly is
happening here is that for each one of
the changes effectively we now have a
new object that has the value of the key
and then the values itself so this will
be things like name iPod pearl and Sarah
so all of these things are then an
observable so what we can then do is
head over to our home door HTML and
inside of the ion content we can
effectively make a new ion list this
will also have an ion list header and
we'll use the header to display the
amount of items for now we'll just
simply put this as items and for each
item using ng for by saying let item of
shopping less dollar don't forget to
pipe that with async I want to simply
display the item don't name so when we
save this file you can now see that we
have iPad pro and the iPad pro 9 edge
will be different for you depending on
what items you added to your shopping
list so this is awesome we can then go
back here and add a new item so let's
add something different maybe the iPhone
X or the iPhone 10 we can say the
quantity is 1 and the price is a
bismil so that's 999 pounds if we then
hits ads we can say that we have finally
the iPhone 10 so what we've then been
able to achieve is a shopping list which
we can add and these items are persisted
on refresh so no matter how many people
access the shopping list they would all
currently get the same shopping list and
spread across different devices but also
we're able to add items to that list
let's make it a little more interesting
now I want to add maybe an alert that
pops up at toast at the bottom of the
screen that maybe says that hey we've
added this item to the list when we
decide to do that and then potentially
the ability to delete and edit items to
open up in the next few videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
