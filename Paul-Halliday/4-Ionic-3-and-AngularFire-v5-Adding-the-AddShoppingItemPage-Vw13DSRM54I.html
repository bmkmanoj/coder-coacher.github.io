inside of the pages and home folder I'm
gonna change the ion title so this is
the title for our navbar - shopping list
I'm going to add the color equal to
primary inside of all homes or HTML nav
bar and this will set the nav bar color
to be blue we should then be able to see
the results of this here on screen to
the right and the next thing I'd like to
do is give us the ability to navigate to
an ad shopping item page so the way that
I'm going to do this is by adding an eye
on buttons element to our nav bar I'm
going to place these buttons at the end
and we'll add a button inside which has
the ion - button Arabic and inside of
the button it has an ion - icon and the
name of the icon is ad notice how we now
have this plus button on our nav bar
what we then need to do is create a new
page creating a new page is relatively
easy all we have to do at this point is
the ionic generates page and the page
that I want to create is going to be
called ad shopping item once that is
completed you should see generated a
page named ad a shopping item and we can
then subsequently head over to our home
to HTML once again and this time add a
nav posh equal to ad shopping item page
this is a declarative way of telling
ioniq that we want to go to the ad
shopping item page so let's select the
button and we are then navigated now you
may find that when you click the button
instead of navigating to this page you
get an error there could be a few
reasons for this error and that's
because potentially the name ad shopping
item page does not match up to the class
so it has to match after this typescript
class here of the page that you
generated
or you may need to restart ionic lab if
you've done both of these things and
sure that you have an ionic page
decorator above your component and your
page has a module file that module file
should be seeing ionic page module door
for child and passing through that
particular page if you're still getting
in or after all of that don't hesitate
to get in touch and I'll see what I can
do to give you a hunt so the next like
you were going to look at this add a
shopping item page we're gonna change
the color of the nav bar to be blue we
want to add a nice fancy title and some
form elements that allow us to
communicate with our database so that's
all coming up in the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
