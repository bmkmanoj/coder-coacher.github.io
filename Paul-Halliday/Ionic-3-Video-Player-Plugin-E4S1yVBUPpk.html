playing videos inside of our ionic
applications to get started we'll need
to install the Cordova video player
plugin to do that we can run ionic
plug-in ads and we'll have to pull this
one from github saw HTTP github calm /m
or us t / cordova - plugin
- video player we can add - - save to
commit this to config dot xml and the
next thing we need to do is install the
ionic native wrapper for this plugin so
npm install at ionic - native slash
video - player we can add - - saves to
commit this - package to json after this
is done i'm going to open this up inside
a visual studio chords the first thing
that we need to do is head over to up up
module built es and then we can import
from ionic native slash video player we
can import the video player and then add
this to the list of providers then
inside of our home page I'm going to
change the title to a video player and
I'm going to add a button to play a
video so button play video I'll add the
iron - button attributes I'll add a
click events equal to player video and
now let's add the play video function
this returns a promise so let's do a
sync play video and we can add a
try-catch to see if there are any errors
and if there are we can say console that
RR e outside of that we all need to
import from ionic native slash video
player the video player and the video
options we can add some video options to
our home page of type of video options
and we can then so this top video
options is equal to and let's take a
look at what we can use within video
options we have the option to set some
initial volume for the video playback
this volume can be added between 0
and one and we can see that if we said
0.3 I will be equal to 30% volume next
we have a scaling modes skill the sensor
is default and we also have another
scaling mode such as scale to fit with
cropping so let's set an initial volume
by saying volume 0.7 and we'll leave the
scaling mode as default for now from
within this function we can then try to
clear a particular URL so I'm going to
put a video url F type string at the top
of my page now that we have our video
URL and our options let's inject our
video player into our constructor by
saying private video player F type in
video player and we can say this top
video player dot player and now we need
a URL the plug-in is able to play either
file URLs or HTTP or RTSP URLs for the
URL I'm going to add this sample video
from tech slides comm feel free to add
whatever video you want here and then
we're going to say if player this dope
video URL and we can pass in our options
by saying this dope video options we can
now add the unrolled platform to our
device by saying ionic platform adds
Android and then to run this we can say
ionic run Android - L if we now select
player video the video starts to play on
my device you won't be or see this
because we are not running an emulator
at this point but instead it's running
on the device itself but I can go and
see that clicking played does indeed
open at that video other things that we
can do is after the video has started to
play we can say a width this dope video
player player and this will then
obviously resolve that promise or
anything we say after this a width will
be run after the promise is resolved in
that then event and B promise is fired
when the video has complete
playing so we can say a video has
completed if at any point you wanted to
stop the video we can make it function M
stop video and we could say this dot
video player dot closed so perhaps three
seconds after the video has started
playing we could set a timeout to close
the video saying this dot stopped video
prior to having a look at this on the
phone let's make a console but log
inside of here that says the video was
stopped so if we click the play button
the video starts to play and then after
that three seconds the video was stopped
and the video completion then fires
obviously this is a very contrived
example but it's up to you how you want
to implement your video playing and
video stopping functionality I'm going
to remove the set timeout for now and
that about wraps up the video player
plug-in within ionic natives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
