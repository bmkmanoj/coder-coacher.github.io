looking at rxjs and observables so
yesterday we made an observer and that
observer passed particular values down
Lee did a stream
we then subscribed to that stream and
logged out that data into the console to
iterate over this again we'll just have
a quick recap if we run this code we can
see that we get the number one in the
console and that is delivered
synchronously if we wanted to mock an
asynchronous call we could use the set
timeout method and then pass down
observer dot next to after one second so
if we run this again you'll see we get
one and then two but not run
asynchronously and the stream is
consistent until we unsubscribe so went
through this before
next we're gonna have like it be
completed and the error methods on side
of our observable so we'll start by
wrapping this inside a try-catch block
so we'll do try and then catch any
errors so let's say we're gonna pass
down at the Warner value then we're
gonna pass down at the number two but
after that we're going to complete the
observable and unsubscribe so we can use
observer dot complete and that will call
the complete method and anything after
this to here and anything after the
complete will not run so to prove this
I'm going to run observer dot next three
if we run this again we shouldn't get
the number three because after the first
next two has been sent on the stream we
are completing the observable and the
three will not be passed down the string
because the stream is no longer able to
be subscribed to so if we run this again
we get one two and nor three and that's
because after the second value that
we'll passing down the stream we are
completing the observable and
unsubscribing
what happens if there's an error inside
of our observable well we can use the
observer error and we can pass down at
the error message down the stream
we can then subscribe to both the
complete and the error messages within
our subscription block so we can say our
on and console that there are any errors
and completes and console the log done
if we run this again we should get as we
expect the number one a second letter
the number two and then a done call
inside of our console so there's one
there's two and there's done if we
wanted to test our error message we
could of course after the second value
before completing the observable run the
observer Ora and say our a message and
if we run that again you see we get one
two and error message
notice though we didn't get done so the
complete method is not called instead
when the error message happens the
observable a result and is unsubscribed
we can prove that normal data is sent on
the stream by commenting out the
completion function clear on the console
and running it again we don't get that
third value observer next after the are
a message so if we delete our observer
daraa and we delete the commented out
function we should find that everything
then works again as expected I hope this
video helped you in understanding both
the completion and error functionality
within our observables if you found this
helpful then hit that subscribe button
because we've got way more videos on the
way and until next time I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
