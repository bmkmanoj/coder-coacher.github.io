like it I think shake functionality to
our ionic 3 applications this
essentially means we're gonna be
watching the device's accelerometer and
when the user shakes the phone we are of
course going to display some data entry
you've made a new project by running
ionic start the name of the project and
blank - - v2 as you can see I've run
ionic start chick blank - - v2 will then
need to install both the Cordova and
ionic native plugins for this to install
the Cordova plug-in we're gonna run
ionic plug-in adds Cordova - plugin
- shake and I'll save it to the
config.xml
let's start by changing directory into
shake and then let's add the shake
plugin so ionic plugin adds Cordova -
plugin - shake
let's also commit this to the convict
XML by using - - sieve we'll also need
to install the ionic native wrapper so
npm install its ionic - native / shake
and we'll also save this to the package
dot JSON I'm gonna be testing this on an
Android device so let's add ionic
platform ads Android and then I'll also
start a live reload server on their
device so ionic run Android - L finally
let's open up in vs code the first thing
we'll need to do is head over the source
app app module and we can import from
ionic - native / shake we can import
shake we can then add this to the list
of providers and we can save the file we
don't need to anything else inside a
part module I'm gonna add the shake
functionality to our home page but you
can add it wherever you want I'm gonna
start off by removing the nav controller
because we don't need it right now I'm
gonna add platform and I'm also gonna
add shake and shake comes from importing
it from ionic native / shake we can
inject both platform and shakes or
privates platform platform and private
shake shake so let's first check that
the platform is ready so this top
platform already
in the den events we will of course use
the this door shake don't start watch so
essentially we can start watching for
the shake gesture now you can pass in an
optional sensitivity here as we can see
it defaults to 40 so let's at the moment
it not pass any sensitivity interrup
after that we can subscribe to this
because it's an observable so we can
take the data stream and at the moments
we will alert shake if somebody shakes
the device for demonstration purposes
are also log it to the console
so I've got my phone in my hand and I'm
gonna shake the phone and you can't see
the moment but there's an alert on
screen which says shake if I press okay
we should get the shake in the console
so that we got hooked into the shake
gesture with in ionic 3 now in the start
watch function we could add an optional
sensitivity number such as 60 or 100 or
whatever you want and play with it as
much as you want so get it as sensitive
or not as sensitive as you want it and
then have fun as you can see there's no
other methods on the shake module so we
only have star watch so that's about it
for looking at shake with an ionic 3 if
you've enjoyed this and you're gonna use
it inside of your applications hit that
subscribe button because there's many
more ionic 3 videos on the way and until
next time my name is Paul and I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
