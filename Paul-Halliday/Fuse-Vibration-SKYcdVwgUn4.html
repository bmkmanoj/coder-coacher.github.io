fuse applications now adding vibration
there's obviously important if you want
to give some sort of haptic feedback to
the user and it's quite easy so we can
start off by creating in new fuse
projects and that is done by saying fuse
create up and then the name of your app
this app is going to be called the
vibration and you'll notice that we
quickly gets created project vibration
at that directory we can now CD into
vibrations or change directory and open
this up inside of our editor now that
were here presented with two files men
view X and vibration or project the dot
lingo project describes the different
packages and inclusions of JavaScript
modules and so on we're going to add a
package to this array and the package is
going to be called fuse with Dom
vibration once we've done that we can
save the file and then we can head over
to member UX inside of here I'm going to
simply put a panel so we can have a
button inside of the panel and when the
button is clicked we can call a
particular function this function will
be named vibrates in order to get access
to that function we have to describe a
JavaScript block so let's add some
JavaScript like so and within the
JavaScript so we can say var vibration
is equal to require and we want to
require a fuse GF / vibration and now we
want to create F function so a big
function remember is called the vibrates
and we can say vibration dots it
vibrates and this takes a parameter of
time of type number so what we can do is
simply say 1 this will then that vibe
read the device for one second
finally we could export this function by
saying module on exports by breads by
breads we can then that run a fuse
preview and of course a fuse preview
targeting it at iOS or Android I have an
Android device plugged in so I'll
because the MS at Android and in order
to do that we'll set - - target -
Android so this will start the build of
our application it should download any
internal packages that we've added such
as fused on vibration and then we should
have our application on screen we will
of course need to add the alignment of
Center to our panel this will put this
in the center and we'll also add some
text to best so the text will say
correct me so to give you an example of
what it looks like you can see it here
on screen we have simply ear button
saying click me and one week like this
so we do get our vibration let's try it
out so then I'll click the button I hope
you can hear that but it definitely did
if I brave for one second so that about
wraps up our vibration that within fuse
don't forget to subscribe to the channel
check out Paul Halliday die or we do
have an article on this and until next
time I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
