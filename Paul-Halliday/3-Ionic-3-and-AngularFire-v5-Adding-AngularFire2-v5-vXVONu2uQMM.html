firebase google.com from here we can
select add project and add any fibrous
project simply give us the name of
something like shopping list and select
it inside of the country that you are
currently living in then hit start and
we'll be navigated to the firebase
dashboard
when we do get to our dashboard I want
you to select add firebase to your web
application now what may be tempting to
click add fibers to your iOS app or add
firebase to your Android app but because
we're adding it to a web app watch is
technically what we're doing we need to
select this button you should then get a
pop-up which contains some information
what we want to do is copy everything
inside of this config file so there
should be things like your API key your
auth dimin database URL and so on at
this point in time we don't want the
firebase initialize app and we don't
want these script tags up top here we
simply only want this object once we
have that information we're going to go
back over to our project and we're going
to make a new file inside of the app
folder called firebase dot credentials
not TS I'm then going to export a new
constant named firebase underscore
config that's going to be a JavaScript
object and inside of this JavaScript
object we're going to put our API key
orthe them in database URL and so on so
the object that you copied from the
previous screen you should now paste it
inside of the object yours will
evidently be different than mine and it
will contain the appropriate information
once we have that the next thing to do
is head back over to our terminal and
now I want to install using NPM install
both firebase and angular fire too if
you're using the latest versions of Nord
and NPM you won't have to add - - save
to this once that has completed we can
head back over to our project and inside
of our root app module don TS i want to
add something to the imports and that
will be the angular fire module and we
can import the angular fire module from
angular fire - and we can then use this
by saying dot initialize app and we want
to initialize the app with the firebase
underscore config which comes from our
credentials file so we can import that
firebase config from dot slash firebase
dog credentials as far as setup goes the
final thing we need to do is now imports
the angular fired database module this
is imported from angularfire to slash
database once we have done that we
should now be able to use both angular
fire and the database inside of our
application in the next lecture we'll
configure the home page and start
getting some tested data on screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
