this is a video I meant to do for a
while and it's to do with native script
side cake now every hero needs a
sidekick including Batman and we need a
psychic as native script developers and
this of course is native script side
cake you can do everything from creating
applications with awesome templates you
can still use your text editor you can
build anywhere you can debug and of
course get access to a variety of native
script plugins as you can see here the
start of templates do go off on
everything from angular but we also have
things like JavaScript typescript and so
on
let's download native script sidekick
for Mac OS and that can be found at
native script don't org slash native
script - sidekick or alternatively type
that into Google and you should get the
Y RL so it's only 46 megabytes of this
morning time so it's shouldn t too long
it's about 10 seconds for me and then of
course we can drag our application into
our Applications folder we can then
select a native script sidekick and open
it from the Internet now funnily enough
I'm on a brand new setup of Mac OS so I
don't even have Java or the native
script CLI I'm then going to open up a
native script psychic and then we are
greeted with this screen we're told that
we haven't created any applications yet
and that is correct
so let's hit create and already we are
greeted with the ability to create an
application and select different project
types we have everything from vanilla
JavaScript which includes templates for
draw navigation tab navigation and of
course master detail we can go through
and look at types crafts where we have
the sim
as well as angular and typescript when
using the angular and typescript
templates it's actually using firebase
as well so that one should be quite
interesting let's open this one up by
selecting it and typing in in you apnoea
let's simply type in my native script up
then simply select a folder by using
browse I'm putting it on my desktop at
this moment in time and when you're
ready hit create up at the bottom right
when you've done that it'll simply pull
this down from NPM and install all of
our dependencies as a result this may
take a little while but simply be
patient and we'll be back again when
this is finished we're currently under
application settings and we have things
like general sayings such as the amp
version the author and descriptions we
can lock in iOS and Android specific
settings as well as any application
assets such as icons and splash screens
and finally other plugins which we can
use let's select build or control B and
as you can see we can do things like a
cloud build or a local build we can also
select a target platform and whether we
want to do a debug or release build when
I select Android and also a debug now I
currently don't have my system ready to
build or emulate on either one of these
platforms but native script sidekick
offers you a user interface and of
course a lot of power when it comes to
using native script as your
cross-platform development tool of
choice let's open up our project now
inside of Visual Studio chords and we'll
get to see the template that has been
created
as you can see we have a simple master
detail view
that has things like a list along with
services but if you notice each one if
the functions are thoroughly commented
so this helps you get started and of
course reduces any complexity that you
might have when you come to getting
started with the templates
so this is how we use native script
sidekick to power up our native script
development
don't forget to subscribe for more near
to script videos and of course check out
Ned of scripting comm if you'd like to
learn it of script and ng rx because
currently uses version 2 but it will be
updated in the near future to use
version 4 thanks a lot for watching see
you soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
