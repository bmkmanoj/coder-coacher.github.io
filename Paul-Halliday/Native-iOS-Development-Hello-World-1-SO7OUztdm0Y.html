video we'll be making an iOS application
for the first time so essentially this
is just a hello world app that will be
running on the simulator all the device
but to get started you will need a Mac
for this so I don't know whether you
want to buy here cheap Mac if you don't
currently have one or if you currently
have one and you're looking to start
development this is how we can do that
so the first task is to get xcode from
the Mac OS app store and this can be
done by searching Xcode into the top bar
here under such and when you do that you
should have an installation option I
currently have this installed and it's
about 60 gigabytes or may take some time
depending on your internet connection
but once that has finished and we have
Xcode
we can simply open that and like I said
this won't be available for Windows its
Mac only so if we can open at this point
we should be given at this screen which
simply says welcome to Xcode and we have
the recent projects here on the site we
can get started with a new Xcode
playground then this just allows us to
play with Swift and other concepts in a
quick and easy fashion outside of that
so we can either open an existing
project or create a new project I'm
gonna head to create a new Xcode project
and at this point we're given the option
to select one of many templates we can
have things like a single view
application a game augmented reality and
much more at this point we'll just
simply stick with our single view
application and hit the next button
I want you to then give this a product
name of something like my first app or
even hello world if you have a team
selected you maybe should select a
development team otherwise just simply
leave that to be none and we also have
things like the organization name and
the organization identifier so at this
point my domain is Paul Halliday don't I
oh so as you can see it's a reversed
ascent acts so we have I or Paul
Halliday and then our application name
which is hello world will give us I owe
Paul Halliday dot hello world now as far
as language goes I would like you to
keep this at Swift at this point but it
really doesn't matter what we click
outside of any other options on this
screen just ensure that at this point in
time you don't have any of these check
boxes ticked as we'll be looking at
these things in future lectures for now
let's hit next and after which you'll be
given a folder to create this
application inside of it creates and
then will be given this screen which
gives us some information about our
application so the first thing that I
advise before even jumping into any of
the cording or storyboarding is just
actually getting familiar with the ex
corde environment itself as you can see
in a second we do have some contextual
tabs here if we were to select the main
storyboards so let's just left click
that and you'll see that now we have
these extra tabs here on the side these
give us more information about our
project but for now all we want to do is
sort of drag this a little bit further
upwards and take the bottom panel up
like this at this point I then also want
to drag this label here on screen if we
just take it and drag it onto our
storyboard like this this then gives us
the opportunity to change the text of
this label so in a standard hello world
application we would usually either
double click this label or edit the
level here on the right so if we just
put this further down again like this
because we don't need to make any more
labels at this point underneath the text
of plan we can simply change the text to
hello world
now if we then lock in our application
we can hold alter and sort of scroll
into the screen like this or
alternatively we can use this plus and
minus here to zoom into the canvas as
well you'll notice that our label has
this a truncated dot so we have these
ellipses at the end of our text and
that's because the boundary box for our
label is too small for the content that
we want to add to the label itself so
there are a few ways around this and
there's a few ways of making some
changes to ensure that our text fits in
the box the first one is just literally
taking it at the bottom here and making
it bigger as you can see we then have
this box and if you think of the HTML
box model you'll notice that we have a
similar concept right here so I'm gonna
make this text about this big and I'm
also gonna move it to the top of the
page you'll notice that X code also
gives us these boundaries so at this
point we can also see that this is the
middle of the page but in order to get
that absolute positioning it's always
good to only make the box as wide as you
need it to be at this point but what if
we wanted to be a bit more precise
perhaps we also want to change the font
to something like 40 so let's click this
T and change the size to be 4-0 and when
we hit done you'll notice that once
again we don't fit inside of this box
well that's where this ruler comes in
handy and this is known as the size
inspector and allows us to change the
width like so for example if we wanted
to be really precise we could say that
we wanted this width to be 200 and this
then gives us at this boundary box being
200 in size and maybe we want to change
the height to something like 40 we could
position this back inside of the middle
of our canvas but what if we wanted to
change your some aspects of our canvas
well we could go back to what's known as
the attribute inspector and the era bit
inspector when clicked on the canvas
itself so not the label so this is
what's known as the view we can then
change the background
so once we hit background you'll notice
that we then have the opportunity to
select to one of many colors we can use
the color picker like so and you'll
notice that these colors are cycled live
on screen so we don't actually have to
say yes to this dialog box before we see
the color we can also select a from a
predefined pencil so we have things like
teal seafoam turquoise and much more I'm
gonna select something like plum and as
well selected plum
we're now noticing that maybe this
contrast ratio is not good enough on
this text so we want to change the color
of the font to be snow and we now have
an application that says hello world and
has this white text but what if we
wanted to duplicate this label well if I
hold down alt and I drag it down you'll
notice that it does give us this sort of
outline of the hello world label and
also this plus sign on the cursor if I
while keeping alter down and the left
mouse button just let go of the left
mouse button you'll notice that it
duplicates this level let's place this
in the middle of the screen and you'll
notice that Xcode does tell us whether
is by these boundary boxes and will
change the font of the label by double
clicking on the label itself and saying
my name is Paul Halliday we can also
change the boundary box like so and
place this in the middle if we wanted to
we could move our hello world text down
like so
and we now say hello world my name is
Paul how are there so how do you get us
on a device we've made our application
we want to display this on the device
and see what it looks like well in Xcode
that's quite easy all we need to do is
go to this top button right here so the
very top left of the screen and hit
build and then run on the current
selected device
now if you have an appropriate iOS
device attached to your machine you
could then select this from the drop
down so now we'll just like the iPhone
air plus and hit this play button
it may come up saying enable developer
mode on this Mac simply hit unable to
continue
to also type in your passwords
and hit or Kier on the dialog
you may see something like the build has
succeeded on the screen
and then it will tell you at the top
here on the sort of progress window that
it is launching the application your
emulator will learn appear on the screen
if we hit this green button here or take
up the full bounds of our screen and
simulators themselves do often take some
time to get started so you may need to
potentially go get a coffee while this
is up and running
and then we have our application it says
hello world my name is Paul Halliday but
notice that we have something wrong
you'll see that our layout at this point
doesn't match the iPhone 8 plus so there
are ways to fix this and that's because
at this point in time we are viewing our
application on an iPhone it
so I want you to select this at the
bottom of the screen and play around
with a few different device types for
example we have the iPhone 10 here an
iPhone 10 gives us the appropriate
bounding box for the notch as well as
the bottom home screen tab but let's set
the iPhone AirPlus and let's move things
in the middle once again now there are
better ways to do this across the device
and that's something we'll be looking at
in future videos but what I want you to
do now is hit the play button once again
I'm gonna hit donned show this message
again and I want the application to be
stopped on the current emulator once we
start our application again you can see
that our content is now in the middle
and if you've made your first iOS
application it might not have many bells
and whistles at this point but you can
start to appreciate just how easy it is
to get started with iOS if you'd like to
