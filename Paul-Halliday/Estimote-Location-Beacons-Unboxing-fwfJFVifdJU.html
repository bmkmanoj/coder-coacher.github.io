firstly thank everyone for supporting
the channel by subscribing and leaving
such kind comments there's been an
overwhelming response and I would like
to just put your mind at rest we do have
a lot of fire based content
MongoDB content and North content coming
on the web as well as ionic of course
another thing that we have in the
pipeline is the series involving
ibeacons
now if you haven't heard of ibeacons
before the usually a little device that
you might want to stick on the wall and
when you walk past a particular beacon
you usually get a message on your form a
little push notification or something
and then you can use contextual data to
talk to the user a special thanks to
estimates who have provided us with a
development kit so that we can create
some ionic tutorials using these
ibeacons now the awesome thing about
ibeacons is that they're compatible with
both Android and iOS and the kit that we
got contains three different beacons a
variety of colors let's take a look at
what's in the box and we can look at
what we've got and look forward to in
the comment series so the front of the
box is estimate location beacons and
this of course contains three low-energy
beacons inside we can open up the box
and we have our three different beacons
the first one is called candy floss and
is pink in color next we have sweet
beetroot and finally we have lemon tarts
so hopefully we'll find a way to use all
three of these beacons and we'll make
some fun projects with them if we look
on the back of the box we get all the
information about the beacons themselves
now we can find out that their water
resistance the mid from quartz and
effectively that means they are highly
durable and you put them on outside
buildings or places which have extreme
temperatures
we can also see that the batteries on
standard settings last five years but
with Paulo seven modes you can get this
to ten years so that's pretty awesome if
you want to make an area nice and
contextual over a lasting period of time
so as far as placing the beacon if we
turn it round we see that we have an
adhesive layer this means we can stick
this to wherever we want and within 45
minutes it will create a permanent bond
for the lifetime of the beacon so there
we are exciting times ahead with the
estimate beacons if there's anything in
particular you'd like me to cover with
the beacons then don't hesitate to get
in touch either or in the comment
section or via email and until then I'll
see you very soon for a series involving
the estimate location beacons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
