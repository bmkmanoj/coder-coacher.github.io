calendar module within 10 door UI so as
you can see I've started out with a
brand new angular CLI project and then
all I've done from then is add the
browser animations module because that's
a dependency on Kendall UI and the
calendar module to our imports as well
as adding the default theme to our
Styles dot s CSS now that we've done
that we can add the Kendall - calendar
component to our app components dot HTML
and you'll notice that the second we do
that we get this calendar and it
currently is focus then on the 20th of
May 2017
now that is today we can Center our
orange focused value if we were to make
a new dent for example F deaths of type
des equal to a new debt of something
like 2010 1111 we did inside of all our
components then add the focus to data
attributes equal to the FD property and
then now you can see that we are in this
December 2010 with focus then on the
dates of the 11th and if we select any
of these beds using the 11th as an
example you'll notice that the selection
that goes Reds and the text goes white
and that's the selected state so we
could do a similar thing and I'm going
to call this s bed if I did which is a
new date equal to 2010-11 and this time
it will be 12 if we change that to B
value now that's the value is any
selected bed equal to the S state
property now you can see that the 12 is
selected by default we can also like a
particular date ranges because you might
want a minimum dibs and their maximum
bids and we can do this by hugging into
the min and Max attribute so before we
do that let's quickly make ourselves in
minimum and maximum did so let's see min
it f-type did is a new debt and maybe
from a 2010 11 11 to the max days of
2011 11 11
so it should be an entire year we can
therefore add the menara Butte to be
that men debt and the max attributes
equal to that max beds I'm going to
remove the selected value for now and
now that you say we only have these
options from December 2010 to December
2011 the option to select today is
grayed out because that's in 2017 and we
only have the option to select one of
these bits another thing that we can do
is remove that left bar we could say
navigation is false and when we do that
you'll notice on that left bar
disappears we can continue to scroll up
and down like before but now we don't
have that selector to the left if we
wanted to hunt into the change events
such as value change we could write a
function such as log value plus in the
day which we will know is a debt and we
can console dot log the debt and now any
time the value changes we do get that
result as you might expect you can also
hook into other things like blur so if
we had a non blur event we could console
the log blur we would also need another
component such as an input and if we
save that if we selected a date and then
selected the input this classes is a
blur event so we've moved away from the
calendar could also hug get into things
like focus on focus and we'll did the
same for our blur but instead will log
on focus if I click inside over the
color that we get our focus log I click
out we get blur if I change your value
we
our value as well as the focus event
because we were blood away from the
calendar and we'll Buccaneer so that's
initially a focus but if we click around
we don't get the focus because we're
already in that context and that just
shows how powerful the Kindle UI
calendar is finding good calendars is
always a difficult thing when you're
looking at different UI libraries
Kendall is definitely nailed it with
this one and if you'd like to see more
Kendall UI components here that
