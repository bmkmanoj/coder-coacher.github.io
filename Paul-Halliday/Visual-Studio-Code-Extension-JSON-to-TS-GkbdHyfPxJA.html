be looking at the json 2ts extension
within Visual Studio chord so if we had
a JSON object that looked like this
for example it has an ID it has a name
user name email address and so on so
it's fairly standard and we are working
on an angular or typescript project and
we want to add static typing to this so
we could go ahead and make our own
interface so we could for example start
exporting an interface named user
and then start adding things like an ID
of type number name of type string and
so on this does take a long time and of
course it's a prawn but I do have a
solution and that solution is the JSON
2ts plugin so what you need to do it's
head over to the extensions tab and type
in JSON - TS and install this into
visual studio cords you can see that it
has nearly about 30,000 people that's
installed it so far and you can actually
use the website for this but if you
don't want to use the website and you
want to use the extension you can of
course copy the JSON object to the
clipboard and then hit ctrl alt V so
let's do that now let's hit ctrl alt + V
as you can see instantly we get the
interface but not only that we get a
numerous amount of sub interfaces - so
each time we have things like an address
and that would give us a nested object
we then have a sub interface here for
address and things like geolocation and
so on so this allows us to create
interfaces for our projects quickly and
easily and then of course go ahead and
user inside of our actual project by
exporting this for example as user and
then if we don't want to export all of
these sub in offenses we don't have to
but of course we could if we wanted to
so let me know what you think inside of
the comment section below thank you very
much for all the support of the patrons
and everybody that's bought the courses
so far over at Paul Holiday aisle
until next time I'll see you very soon
in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
