once again and now we're going to look
at creating observables using the from
method so let's say we have an
observable once again we're gonna have
my observable is equal to our X dot
observable dot from and B from means we
can pass in a particular value so if we
had the value hi
and then we subscribed to the observable
I'm gonna log this out to the console we
get H and I because each one of the
strings is passed in as the on next call
if we add this to an array and run again
we actually get the string itself hi
instead of two different characters we
could make a function so let's say we
had let hobb and we'll call our
observable and this will be equal to a
function with some arguments and then we
can return the observable from with
those arguments like that
commence there orb and then pass in as
some arguments so I'm gonna pass in an
array with the numbers 1 2 3 and then
we're going to subscribe to that
observable and log the result out to the
console and we get 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 with this we
can also perform a map events so we can
map once again and this time we're going
to take the value and we will times the
value by 4 and we get 4 8 and 12 so this
is just another way to make and
observable and I recommend we do it like
this so creating observables using the
from and passing in some arguments we
can then subscribe to the observable and
of course during this point in time we
can also map up and do a variety of
other operators so this is using the
from method when creating observables my
name is Paul if you like this and sure
to hit that subscribe button we got win
more rxjs content on the way and until
that time I'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
