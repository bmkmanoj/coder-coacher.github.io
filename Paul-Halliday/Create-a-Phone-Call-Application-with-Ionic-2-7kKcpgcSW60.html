going to look at creating F form dialer
application within ionic 2 so simply
make a new app by running ionic start
thorne dialer blank - - V - now that's
downloaded we can CD into form - Tyler
we can then add the Cordova plugin by
simply running ionic pull again ads call
- number and then as with every a on a
kinetic plugin we'll have to add the
ionic native wrapper run npm install at
ionic - native slash call - number and
make sure you save that to the project
here with - - save i'm going to be
testing this on my android app as we're
developing this so I'm going to run
ionic platform ad Android then I'm going
to run this on the devices or ionic core
on Android - L that'll make sure there's
a library Lord server on the device any
changes we make will automatically be
updated on the app so let's open up in
vs chords the first thing that we're
going to do is head over to app module
PS and we'll import the call number
plugin so we want to import from ionic
native / call number and we want to
import call number we then have to add
this to the list of providers and this
just essentially means that we can use
call number throughout our components so
in our home - HTML I'm going to change
the title to UI onyx dialer I'm going to
change the navbar color to primary and
I'm going to make an input and that
input is going to simply be n number so
I on item inside the item we want an eye
on label and there's gonna be a floating
label which is simply going to save for
number and after the level will have an
eye on inputs of type tell using the
teletype to means that the format
keyboard opens when somebody clicks the
inputs instead of giving people access
to the QWERTY keyboards and then we want
a sub button at the bottom right sore
eye on fab what
right inside the five will be a button
or RBI on five after view and will also
make an icon inside the pub so iron icon
the name of which will be caught so here
you can see our super simple UI assembly
air form and fr bun I'm now going to go
over to home TS and we're going to
import from ionic native call number we
will import call number
we will then injector inside of our
constructosaurs call call number so we
can make a function named call number
and it's going to return a promise and a
we'll be making this air sink so make
sure that your TS config is targeting
es6 and then we can add a sink call
number we can then try to resolve the
promise so we can do your width this
call call number as you can see it
requires in number to call and it also
requires a do linear which is bypass of
user that's effectively if we add true
we'll simply use the defaults for nap on
the device and that's why i recommend so
we can put a number in here and we do
want to bypass the add chooser
we need air catch so if there is an
error we want to simply log out
pyaara right now this would work but we
want it to be a little bit more dynamic
so let's hook up our inputs and our
input will simply have an NG model and
the ng model will simply be for net
number can add this phone number to our
home two TS so phone number we want it
to be if type number and when you want
to use it inside the call number
function we can simply cast it to a
string so we can say string this door
form number and this now conforms to the
string that we actually need for the
call number function if i nothing we
need to do is hook it up to our button
so inside of our button we can add a
click events CB call number and then we
can test it on the device so I'm simply
going to add in a random number
and press cool and it's going to ask me
whether I want to give the dialer the
permission I'm simply going to say yes
and it starts calling the number so
there we are phone calls within ionic 2
and ionic native 3.1 if this helped hit
