but today we're going to talk about the
hyper pokemon theme in front of you
right now you can see the Pikachu theme
but there is another variety of options
of Pokemon that you can choose let's
start off by getting the hyper Pokemon
plug-in installed inside of your hyper
preferences so head over to your hyper
preferences and inside you want to add
is the hyper - pokemon that plug-in
after that underneath your colors you
want to add the following if pokemon
such as Pikachu
the Pokemon syntax such as light or dark
and unibody either true or false let's
take a look at the different themes
available if we head over to hyper -
Pokemon don't github dot are your you
can see that we can choose things like
Bulbasaur Ivysaur Charizard squirtle and
much more there's quite a few been added
and you can see that on their Trello
board and at the moment I'm using
Pikachu but you can choose everything
from Blastoise Charizard and so on if
you wanted to add one there you could
just simply change this to squirtle and
you can also use random so if you were
to select random this would make it
random Pokemon appear each time that you
open up hyper as we've changed ours to
squirtle you can see the squirtle theme
and I'm now going to save it to random
so you can see it different one each
time so this is the awesome hyper
Pokemon terminal theme I suggest you get
it and install it in your system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
