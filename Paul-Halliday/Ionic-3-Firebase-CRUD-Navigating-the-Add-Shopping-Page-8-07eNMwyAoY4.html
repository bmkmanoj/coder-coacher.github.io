to do is the touch a click event to our
button so to attach a click event we can
add two brackets and inside we can add
click this essentially says when the
user clicks on this button for example
when the click event is fired then it
should execute a particular function for
example this function is responsible for
the click event so let's make a function
named navigate to add shopping page now
we can head over to our shopping list
components and we can create this
function and navigate the user to the
add shopping page one Li select the
bottom
I'm going to remove the ion viewdidload
from the shopping list page as we don't
need at this point in time and instead
I'll add a function named navigates to
add a shopping page inside of here we
can access the nerve controller and
that's because the mouse controller was
injected into our constructor this is
done automatically when we generate a
page with the ionic command-line
interface the nerve controller comes
from ionic angular and it's responsible
for allowing us to navigate between
pages let's use an app controller by
seeing this dot nav control push and
then we need to push a page into the
navigation stack so if we add a comment
so we can send navigates the user to the
add shopping page
reference of the ad shopping page let's
import that from our pages
imports from ad shopping / ad shopping
the ad shopping page we can then pass it
here to our nav control and if we save
the file and head back to our
application and select the price button
you'll find that we are navigated to the
ad shopping page we can also hit this
back button to go back to the home page
because we've added the dog pashya
if instead we had said Santa route then
we wouldn't have that back button
because the ad shopping page would be
the route page let's put it back to
being push so that we have that back
button</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
