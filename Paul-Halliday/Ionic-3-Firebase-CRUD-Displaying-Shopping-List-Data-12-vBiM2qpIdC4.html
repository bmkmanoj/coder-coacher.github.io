create a shopping list reference and we
can have at door because we are going to
be making this of type fire-based lists
observable so if you remember how to
import a firebase list observable go
ahead and do that now and as you can see
that's from angularfire 2 slash database
so we can see our reference is type of
firebase list observable and then you
also have to make it of type something
and that something is a shopping item
but do you remember that it's actually a
list of shopping items so if it's a list
of shopping items then it has to be in a
rare so now we need to import our list
of shopping items and that can be done
by importing it from our models so
that's simply importing that shopping
item interface with that said and done
the next thing to do is import our
angularfire database once again so that
can be done by saying private database
and that is then of type and Gila fire
database and we can pull out from under
fire to slash database so all we need to
do is add this to the current list of
imports and from here we have quite a
simple job because all we need to now
say is that our shopping list reference
can be pointed out the database don't
list and then if you remember the
reference from before that reference is
the shopping list
so essentially what was then at this
point is that we're pointing the
shopping list
reference at firebase and then of course
that shopping list node
that means not only can we push things
from this reference to the database but
also we have access to everything inside
of that nodes so if we think of this is
almost like a lens directly into this
piece of data we Center 5si or when
everything inside of this nodes I want
to be able to add things I want to be
able to remove things so it acts almost
as if it's there inside of the client
and essentially it is directly there in
the client but what you have to do with
every observable is observables are lazy
so nothing happens with this observable
right now until we subscribe to it so
even though we've done this we
essentially have nothing so we need to
subscribe to our reference and that can
be done by heading up our reference and
saying subscribe we then have the data
in which we could log out to the console
so if we log down X we could see the
results of the shopping list but when
displaying data like this there is a
better way to do that so let's remove
that for now and we can hand it over to
our shopping lesbo HTML so this is the
view and once again we have quite an
easy time and that's inside of our iron
content what we need to do is
essentially make an ion list and this
allows us to have a list of ion items so
we can have ion item and in order to
make a list we can use something called
ng4 and this is is structural directive
inside of angular and it allows us to
repeat these elements for however many
items there are inside of the array so
we can say let item of shopping list
reference and currently because this is
not servable
we need to pass the async pipe so let's
make this pipe here and type async
afterwards what this does is it allows
angular to handle all of the unwrapping
and subscribe
being and unsubscribing if I were
observable and instead we gather data
back like in normal air air because if
we didn't use the async pipe this
wouldn't work so now that we have that
it's essentially going to repeat this
item for however many items we have
inside of our shopping list
so let's simply start off with a hedge -
and we can simply say item dot item nem
and what we can do here is there item
lim is equal to and we can pass in that
template and we can do the same thing
with a h3 with a mount and we can do
that item dot item number so let me just
make a quick comment on this essentially
it's going to repeat the I on item for
as many items that we have inside of our
shopping list so that's all we need to
do if we save our file already we can
see now that we have this item limb of
pizza and item name of cheesecake inside
of our application so let's put this
through the ultimate test if we click
our plus button and we add something to
the item name let's add something like
ice cream and maybe we want 10 ice cream
and if we hit an item instantly you can
see that we have the ice cream added to
our list and this is also persisted to
our database and what the magic of this
is is that there's next to no codes
the only thing that we have to display
our cord is simply this ng 4 over the
eye on item and inside of our shopping
list page were simply pointing the
reference at the shopping list nodes
inside of our add shopping dot es we are
simply using the dot push on the
reference and that acts as a standard
array essentially it's just a similar
thing we're just simply adding an item
to the array and all of the rest is
handled frost by the Angela fire SDK and
the even better thing about this is
actually going to change some of the
data on a separate computer so I'm going
to change this ice-cream to instead be
chicken now one of the awesome things
about 5s is that if I update the dead of
perhaps from a different machine if I
type in something here like chicken and
this is on an entirely different machine
and if I type that in to firebase and I
hit enter right now you'll see that it
gets updated instantly on our
application we don't have to refresh we
don't have to do anything together data
back it's simply updated on all of our
clients at once this is the power of
firebase and especially this type of
ease of use is what makes it so popular
in the development world let's take a
look at removing an item from the list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
