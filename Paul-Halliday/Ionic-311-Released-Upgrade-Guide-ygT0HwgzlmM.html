get upgrading our ionic applications to
ionic 3.11 if you've already liked
upgrading your ionic up to three point
one zero this should be an easy upgrade
for you I'm going to take an ionic at
three point zero one up and take it to
ionic three point one one
if you haven't seen already angular 4.1
has been released but I have yet to do
any extensive testing with ionic 3.1 and
angular 4.1 if you've done that let me
know in the comment section below but at
the moment I'm going to keep our angular
versions 2 4.0 or 2 so 4.02 it is and
ionic native I'm going to put two three
point six one the ionic angular package
can be 3.11
and I'll also be upgrading the app
scripts to one point three six once
you've done that you can remove the nord
modules folder and of course run npm
install once again if you want a list of
the things that have changed in ionic
3.11 check out the list here on screen
240 bug fixes and sure to keep your
ionic version up to date because you
don't want to be in a position where it
makes it hard for you to my grades to
future versions now that my dependencies
have installed I'm going to run ionic
serve and when we run ionic serve we get
the latest application without any
errors inside of our console so that's
how to upgrade to ionic 3.11 if you did
like this video and you want to see more
ionic content let me know in the comment
section below and of course check out
the learn ionic 3 from scratch course
over our two udemy I have a discount
code for that inside of the description
until that time hit the subscribe button
to stay updated and my name is Paul I'll
see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
