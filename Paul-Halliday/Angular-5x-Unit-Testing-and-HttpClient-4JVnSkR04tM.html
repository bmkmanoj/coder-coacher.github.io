test we do have the green here down the
side but if it was to change something
you would notice that instantly we would
get not only the error message but also
the red box so in order to test the HTTP
client we need to have a service that of
course takes advantage of that so let's
generate ourselves a new service I'm
going to run ng gs4 ng generate service
and this will simply be called data I
would most likely place this inside
about providers or service folder but
we'll simply just be importing it into
the providers inside of our app module
the data service itself will simply have
a root URL
we can set that equal to any API that we
want to use I'll be using the JSON + or
the API and I'll be making a function
called get posts this will return us a
list of posts but in order to take
advantage of that we'll need to import
the angular HTTP client from angular
common HTTP we can then inject that into
our constructor
we can return this HTTP don't get and
one T's back takes to return at the root
URL slash posts now if we've done
everything correctly we should then of
course get a list of posts on-screen but
what we want to do is as we sort of add
more to this service and maybe as we add
more to our application we want to
verify that we're actually getting a
list of posts from our API and that
everything's working correctly so we'll
head over to our data service spec TS
you'll notice that inside of the
describe block we're describing that we
want to be testing the did a service
before each test is run we're creating a
new module with a test bed and we're
providing that data service to this
class now there are a variety of ways in
which we can go about testing it
provider we could if we wanted to
provide a more keya but the HTTP client
gives us what's known as the HTTP client
testing module
so let's first off import that from an
angular slash common HTTP testing we can
then add that to our test bed module and
instead of injecting the data service
each time into the it assertion what
we'll do instead is make ourselves a
reference to a service which will be of
type data service and we'll assign that
only once so inside of our before each
year will sense service equal to test
beds don't get and what this does is it
gives us an injected version of that
data service which we can then use
throughout our project and then going to
delete this it assertion like so and
inside of our data service perhaps we
want another describe block here or we
could go down everything to do with
getting posts but for now I'm simply
just gonna have an it block which says
it should retrieve
from the API we could also add via gets
here if we wanted to as well and we can
test our certian also so now we have the
body of our it's function and we can
start off by making some dummy posts and
what this essentially will be is just
some posts that we can expect to get
from our API so maybe you would have a
user ID and that happens to be a string
an ID which happens to be a number if
body sort the body of the post and
finally the title such as testing
angular let's have a couple of items
inside about dummy post and we can even
go ahead and maybe make a models folder
and inside of here we might want a post
Model Ts we can export an interface
called post that has these different
things we can then send a proper it type
and the next thing we want to do at this
point so we have some dummy posts that
we expect to get back we then want to
say service don't get posts and this is
our get posts method as you can see at
the moment it returns an observable of
object so we can go and fix that by
heading back to the service and instead
saying it will be an observable of posts
we can subscribe to this inside of our
service and at this point now we have a
list of posts or an array of posts we
can expect that the posts don't length
so this would be the array that we get
back should be equal to two and
that's because what's happening is it
doesn't matter how long that the posts
are from the air pie itself the dummy
posts will instead replace that data so
we could also make another assertion
that maybe the posts themselves would be
equal to the dummy posts so we're nearly
there what we need to do at this point
is now is start a fire off that request
because we haven't actually fired a
request at this point we need to then
use what's known as a hedge ttp mock so
this comes from at the HTTP testing
controller and that comes from the
angular common HTTP testing module so we
can make and you let HTTP mock of type
HTTP testing controller we can now set
the value of our HTTP mock equal to test
bed of gets and this time we want to get
the testing controller and here inside
of our it block again we want to start
setting up our request so that could be
equal to our HTTP mock dot and then we
have a few different things we have
expect none this means that no requests
should have been sent we have expect one
and also match and verify we want to
expect one at this point because we only
want to expect that there was a single
request made to our URL so we expect
that the request was made to our service
don't root URL and at this point I'm
going to remove privates from our data
service so we simply just have this root
URL public to the class and then I'm
going to add slash posts after that we
can expect that the request itself dot
request so this is the request object
and the methods should be equal to get
so essentially what we're asserting at
this point is that the methods of our
HTTP call should have been get so if
this was something like post then of
course it would fill and the final thing
we need to do is say request don't flush
and pass through our dummy posts because
what this is then doing is its allowing
our get posts to use this dummy posts
here and allows us to fire off that HTTP
request as you can see here the flush
method returns the body and any other
dead as such as the response headers if
provided and so far we have a passing
test now at this point everything works
as expected it does retrieve us those
dummy posts we are of course looking at
the get method and we're pointing our
HTTP clients at the service route URL
slash posts the final thing to do at
this point is to add an after each and
what we want to run inside of this after
each is HTTP mock dot verify and what
this does is it just means that anytime
we test our data sore for example if we
make an assertion on the HTTP mock
itself it will ensure that there's no
requests outstanding and then we don't
have any sort of stared issues going
into another test so let's just run
verify like so and that finishes up
testing our HTTP client if we head back
over to our data service and we instead
change this to be slash post you'll
notice that instantly our HTTP mock does
fail because it does expect the URL to
be slash posts so what we end up with is
a test that that allows us to of course
check to see whether we are retrieving
posts from our API via get and of course
we are looking to see those dummy posts
as well so what have we locked down
inside of this lecture well we've looked
at things like test bed and making
testing modules we've liked a getting
instances of injected services using
test bed don't get we've looked at the
httpclient testing module and the
subsequent testing controller we've
looked at determining whether our URL
was correct whether our request method
was also correct and this allows us to
then of course test to see whether we
are getting those posts as expected
