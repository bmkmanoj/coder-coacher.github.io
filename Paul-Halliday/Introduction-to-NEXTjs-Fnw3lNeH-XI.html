be looking at max but yes to there and
that's a minimalistic server-side
rendering framework for Reax
applications let's start off by making a
directory named hello
next we can change our command line path
to hell or next with CD hello next now
if we initialize a default package.json
with NPM annette's - why we can go ahead
and install our dependencies so the
dependencies for our project will be npm
install next at better and that will be
version 3.0 we also need to react and
react dom let's our - - save to commit
this to package JSON this is not
required if you're using NPM 5 and above
and we can go ahead and hit enter this
will then install our dependencies and
while it's doing that we can talk a
little bit about next
so next offers a really easy API for
making new routes to make a new route we
simply define a JavaScript file inside
of a pagers folder we can consider a
route to be a specific web URL for
example if we have our home page slash
about that would be the about route if
we wanted to do the same for contact
then our URL would be slash contact now
in each one of these instances all we
have is a particular file for example
named about or contact don't GIS there's
no other functionality that we need to
add to our JavaScript file it's simply
handled by next so let's make directory
named pages and inside of pages let's
first off make a index routes by saying
touch index GS and if we navigate back o
an openness inside of our editor we
should first off be able to go to our
package dot JSON and if we go to our
package JSON we can define a new script
named dev and what this script dev then
allows us to do is run our application
in the browser so prior to running the
script let's head to index dot GS and
export if function
that simply renders the woods hello
next
and it really is as simple as that if we
then run npm run dev inside of our
terminal you'll find out that it kicks
off next and our build is available here
on localhost - 3000 and when we do never
get to localhost
3000 we can see that we have hello next
here inside of the browser so together
up and running was super easy if I
change this to next is awesome I did
never need to refresh the page it's
automatically
hot reloaded so we find that in order to
make any changes it's super simple
that's also updated as soon as you make
them changes so let's take a look at how
we can route between more than one page
for example if we see deed into the
pages directory and we made a new file
named about OGS we want to link the user
from indexed or GS to about OGS and
remember in both of these occasions they
are routes inside of our app
so inside of index what I want to do is
actually import a link from next slash
link inside of all paragraph tag we can
see next is awesome and perhaps we could
also add an anchor tag which says learn
more we can surround the anchor tag with
a link
and inside of all link we need to define
the hedge ref and the hedge ref and this
scenario is simply about so let's go and
make some functionality inside of our
about page we can export a default which
simply says hello about
if we now select next is awesome and
click learn more we now get hello a bolt
and in this scenario if we take a look
in our URL bar of course we do have that
slash about so getting up and running
with server-side render to react
applications with next that don't GS is
super simple and you've seen just how
easy it is to make new routes to make
changes and of course the link people to
those different routes if you'd like to

about ionic and native script don't

time I'll see you very soon in the next
