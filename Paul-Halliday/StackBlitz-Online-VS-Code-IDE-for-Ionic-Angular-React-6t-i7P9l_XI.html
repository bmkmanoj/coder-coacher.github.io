making the rounds here on Twitter is in
new app called start blitz and what
start wit allows us to do is make
angular react or ionic applications here
inside of our browser one of the
benefits of stuck words over other sites
is that it has an embedded version of
Visual Studio chords this allows us to
do everything from intellisense project
search go to definition and other key of
vs chord features as well as things like
hot reloading NPM packages offline
editing and an instant hosted
application URL let's select a new ionic
project for reference and as you can see
we have a new ionic app built as quick
as bad against hello and welcome to
ionic on the screen and I'm just going
to make this in low larger and if we go
ahead and navigate to our pages
directory something like our home but H
tml we could change the title to be
start bliss and you can see that we
instantly get this update here on the
browser we can navigate as usual because
everything inside of here is the
standard ionic app but already we have
this URL in which we can send other
users to so if we copy this and as you
can see here when we go to this URL here
is our ionic app we can navigate the
tabs as expected and any changes that we
do make on the initial application we
just have to hit save and will be
updated on the URL this makes creating
new projects with ionic and sharing them
with other people
super easy as we can do it from right
here inside of style it's like I said
it's not limited to ionic we can also do
with angular and react but overall it's
a very nice editor and it's a good
experience because it's what we all know
and love Visual Studio chords
as far as I'm aware the project is
relatively new so you might see some
changes by the time you actually see
this video but I'm very happy with the
performance of start let's and I'll be
using it and quite a few of the upcoming
courses that I already have in
production
specifically a react course that I do
have coming very soon but like I said
I'm very happy with backwards and I'd
love to know what you think inside of
the comments section below
if you start a new ionic up you can now
share it relatively easy with this new
platform don't forget to hit that
subscribe button to staff did with more
videos don't forget a check out Paul
Howard ed die or for learn ionic 3 from
scratch and other courses and once again
I would also like to assign to the
patreon for supporting me every month as
it allows me to make as much content as
this every day until next time I'll see
you very soon in that next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
