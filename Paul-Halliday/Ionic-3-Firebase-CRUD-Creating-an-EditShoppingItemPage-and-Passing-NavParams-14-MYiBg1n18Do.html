terminal inside of our editor and that
can be done with control back take on a
Mac and I'm going to state ionic
generates page and its shopping item
you can see we've generated a page named
edit shopping item let's follow the
procedure to add this to our application
necessary remove the ioniq page
decorator if you don't want to use lazy
loading and then inside of all app
module TS we can import from pages slash
edits shopping item and at shopping item
and then import the Edit shopping item
page we can add the page to our
declarations and we can also add our
page to our entry components
now inside of our edit shopping item
page I want to also explore how we can
get access to the data inside of our
angularfire database inside of our
typescript file there may be times where
you want to mutate the data and you
don't necessarily want to display it
with the async pipe although you could
then make a custom component and pass
the intimate components let's take a
look how we can do it inside of this
page as always to use angularfire we
will need to import from angularfire to
slash database the angularfire database
this circumstance to deal with the
object only we can look at the firebase
object observable so instead of
importing the list observable now let's
import the object observable and this
time we can say that our shopping item
reference because we're no longer
looking at the list can be a type
firebase object observable and this one
will need a type so in order to use the
type we can say that we want to import
from our models slash shopping item
slash shopping item
interface so we're now essentially
saying that this is a shopping item
reference which is a firebase object
observable of type shopping item
can then inject our database by saying
private database a type angularfire
database and we can set the reference of
our shopping item by saying this dot
shopping item reference dollar is equal
to the database but this time instead of
lists we can point it at the object and
we can say a shopping - list but at this
point we don't want the entire database
we don't want the entire node for
shopping list instead we want a
particular ID so how might we pass the
ID to this page well that comes by
saying / and don't forget we are using
the birth takes at this point and for
now I'm just going to simply use a
placeholder variable which I'm going to
call shopping item ID and the way that
we're going to get that is via the nav
parameters so we're going to say capture
the shopping item ID as in nerve
parameter and we can make a Const
shopping item ID and that will be equal
to this donor params get and then of
course we can pass in that shopping item
ID but at the moment we're not passing
any sort of ID across to this page so
that means we need to head back over to
our shopping list and inside of our
select a shopping item function where we
have edits
we are to send the user to the editor
shopping item page and pass the key as
air parameter so do you remember how we
get the key for our shopping item
well we gather key by accessing the dot
dollar key on our shopping item and
that's because each item inside of our
5s database has a dollar key and that's
how we reference the particular ID so we
can see this dot not control dot posh
and now we need to push the user to the
Edit shopping item page but in order to
do that we need a reference so let's
head up to the import section of our
shopping list page and what we need to
do is import the Edit shopping item page
and that comes from edit shopping item /
edit a shopping item so as you can see
we now have a reference to that page we
can use that inside of our nav
controller and we can set this don't
have control dot posh we can pass in the
Edit shopping item page and then if we
add a comma here you'll see that we can
pass through any parameters so these
parameters can be passed as an object so
we'll make the key for our object equal
to shopping item ID
and be value equal to the shopping item
dot key so now our now stock looks like
this
the moments will you'd be on the
shopping list page but would be
navigating the user to the Edit shopping
item page but not only that we'd also be
passing through air parameter of
shopping item ID with the ID of whatever
the selected item was so for example if
the selected item was cheesecake then
the ID would be this ID here this would
then allow us to reference that
particular element only inside of our
Edit shopping item page if we head over
to our Edit shopping item page where
we're capturing the ID we can then log
this out to the console by console dot
log shopping item ID so we can log out
the nav Khurram
if we select cheesecake and hit edit we
navigated to the Edit shopping item page
and there is the ID for our cheesecake
in the next lecture let's take a look at
how we can create ourselves a template
and perform some updates to this object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
