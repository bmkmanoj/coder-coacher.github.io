continuing with the moon theme and we'll
be looking at a graph component for moon
so let's start a new moon project or we
can do this in a few ways we can use the
moon CLI or we can use the CDN for now
let's simply use the CDN I'm going to
call this moon bars
and inside of this file I'm going to
make an index to HTML and in app Geass
then I open this up inside of Visual
Studio codes and we'll also open this up
inside of HTTP server so as always we
will start off with in new html5 project
I will put the title to be mundo Des
Barres
then we will add mundo GS to our
index.html and I can be done by adding
in new script with the source of
unpackage comm slash moon GS / dist /
moon dot GS and this is a development
build so if you want to add a production
build you will have to just simply say
unpackage comm / moon GS or when you're
going into production either pull in
from the CDN like that or use webpack
so we now have moon Dawn's yes we no
need the moon bars so in order to get
moon bars make sure that we've already
imported moon yes the next thing we can
do is pull in another script source at
unpackage comm slash moon - bars
so that's moon bars and this then allows
us to use bar charts inside of our app
underneath all of this I'll put in our
application and of course comes at Epcot
yes
so inside of opto GS we need to tell
moon that we want to use the moon bars
plug-in and that can be done by moon use
and we'll pass in moon bars as we have
imported that from the CDN this is a
global variable here so we don't need to
worry about importing this and this
moment in time
so at this point we may want to specify
a new moon instance because we may have
a moon instance and we want to do things
with this moon instance for example we
could bind things like data and other
fills that potentially we want to look
at so we want to make it new moon and we
can't specify this to be a Const perhaps
named app and we'll specify that our
moon instance needs to be on a div with
the ID of app so we can head orbit our
index dot HTML and above everything so
the first item inside of our body we can
make it div with the ID of app just a
test that everything works let's give
this a template of with a h1 hello world
so here we have a moon instance with a
template of hello world perhaps then
inside of our moon instance we want a
data object and that would contain
different things about our bar charts so
we might have some data points and our
data points would actually be in a rare
and we also have a fill both of these
things would be in a ray because we'd
specify different data points and
perhaps different fills so let's like
it's specifying some different data so
if we had some data points that went 10
9 8 7 and 6 we could then have a fill or
potentially something like a darker
amethyst and going down into a sort of
navy blue let's save our file and what
we need to do now is use the bars
component and pass through the data and
the fill so let's do that
inside of our template we can use bars
and we can use em literal to bind to the
data points as well as the fill and as
you can see we then have some bars
on-screen we could potentially like
you're making this even darker so if we
added another one and we refresh the
page you'd see that we now have a darker
fill
we can also pass a height not just 200
and a width such as 400 to our bars and
if we zoom out you can see that we can
change the height and width of our bars
so it's only quite interesting I'd love
to know what you think and of course
