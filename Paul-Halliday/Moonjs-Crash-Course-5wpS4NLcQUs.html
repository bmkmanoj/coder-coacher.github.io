this video we'll be looking at the moon
library for now let's just create a new
file for index for HTML and an apt GS
we'll open this up inside a visual
studio chords and I'm also going to run
HTTP server on this current directory
this means we can open this up inside of
the browser and to start with we can
head over to index dot HTML inside of
here I'm going to open up a new Emmet
abbreviation for html5 will have the
title that simply says moon and inside
of the body what I want to do is create
a new script and it's going to point an
unpackage and this is a development
build for moon when you want to use this
in production just get rid of the slash
dist
and slash moon GS so that's how we add
moon to the project what we can then do
is for another script file and point my
ID add GS and that will be our
application above the script files and
then going to create one div and that's
gonna have the ID of app what this is
going to do is allow moon to mount
itself to this element we'll take a look
at what that means in a second but let's
head over to our GS first and create a
new app and have that equal to a new
moon we can put the element to be
hashtag app and if we did this nothing
would happen at this point in time
because nothing has happened
apart from moon mounting itself to this
div what I want to do is to have a hitch
one and I want to display a title so
let's bind to what would be a title
variable here and in order to do that we
have to go over to our new moon and we
have to add something called air data
now data allows us to store what's known
as data in our application and this is
reactive so that means anytime this
changes the Dom also is changed so let's
make a title and that will be equal to
hello
when we said on file and we take luck
inside of the browser we then have hello
moon and that appears to us on screen
because what is happening at this point
is this mustache syntax here this is
actually interpolation binding on what
moon is doing is taken this variable and
displaying the value of that here on
screen inside of this h1 anytime this
data is updated this will then be
reflected inside of our application so I
can he send right now how do we change
this data well when we make this app is
equal to a new moon that gives us an
instance of the new moon so he is saying
at this point well we can create a new
moon and we can initialize some did our
such as title how do we change that and
how do we see moon's reactivity but what
we need to do is because we have this
constant app is equal to a new moon we
then have access to the app dot set
methods we need to target the data of
title and we can give this a new title
such as goodbye moon and if we save that
we just refresh our browser we can see
that we have hello moon to start with
but then we get goodbye moon and we
could wrap this if we wanted to in
something like a set timeout and the set
timeout would allow us to see that
change after one second so if we refresh
we can see hello moon and that turns
into goodbye moon after one second so
well then able to look at things like
changing our data using a set how do we
call a method so if I wanted to call a
method that then was to alert somebody
so for example if we wanted to alert
something like hello world well how
would we do that of course if we just
hit the Save button and we refresh our
page we do get hello world at this point
but maybe I want to click a button but
we could make a methods object and that
methods object could have an alert user
and we could then alert the user saying
hello world so how do we call that
method well we have a couple of ways of
doing that let's firstly like by making
something an indexed or HTML I'll have a
button and then we'll look at these
things in the future but we can use
what's known as directives to hook into
the click event so we can have em - on
we can use the call on for on click and
then when we have the click event we can
call our alert user function and to add
the text of alert inside of the button
and we'll refresh the page when we hit a
lot we then get over a lot which says
hello world so that's how we can hook
into the em on directive for click but
also at the same time how we can define
M methods now we can call the methods in
another way we can also use app dot call
methods and in here we firstly want to
determine the name of the method so this
would be alert user and then afterwards
we'd have an array with
any parameters so let's put a message as
a parameter and instead of saying hello
world let's alert that message we can
now put a different message such as moon
is awesome and when we hit save and
refresh our page you then get an alert
saying moon is awesome and that's
because the method has been called from
within our
yes so why do we want to use this app
dual core method to actually call our
methods instead of creating something
like this so if we had something like
Const alo user is equal to a new method
that simply alerts hello world why do we
want to do that well inside of our
methods we actually have access to this
as a reference to the instance so for
example this gives us then reference to
our app instance in which instead of
saying things like a dot set we can say
this don't set so perhaps we want to
display our hello moon message again
instead of goodbye moon well what I'm
going to do is remove this alot user I'm
going to rename this alot user to
instead be hello moon
we'll leave the message parameter for
now and we'll say this don't set the
title to be hello moon so if you
remember initially we have the title of
hello moon and then gets sent to goodbye
moon and we're setting it back to hello
moon let's call a method hello moon with
no parameters let's refresh our page we
get hello moon goodbye moon and
obviously because this is at a timeout
and obviously because the goodbye moon
is in a timeout let's also place this
inside of a timeout we'll put that to be
1500 so after 1.5 seconds we want to
call the hello moon method which
obviously sense the title to be hello
moon once again so if we save this and
we refresh we get hollow moon goodbye
moon and back to hell or moon so that's
how we can access our instance and call
in methods
albeit this morning some we are
certainly using some strange methods
with set time arts but that's just
simply for demonstration purposes now
what if we want to do things like
conditional rendering so in angular you
might seem something like ng if in view
we have something like V if essentially
what we're doing is we're determining
whether to short a message so let's have
a data object called sha message and
we'll make that equal to true and I'm
going to remove this at time arts and
stuff for now and we'll have a message
inside of our app instance that will be
a h1 and this will be a hidden message
this won't in time it's not gonna be
very hidden because gonna have an M if
and what we want to do is give the sure
message here the parameter of our M if
so if we said sure message and I'm gonna
remove the Allah button for now but as
you can see we can then see this hidden
message on screen and that's because
we're telling moon
if this sha message is equal to true
then it display this message if your
message becomes false all message
no longer appears and that's because
moon is conditionally determining at
this point in time whether that message
is true or false in a similar sense to
before we can make a new method named
sure hidden message and we can set this
your message to be true or even to be
the reverse of its current value and we
can sit up door call methods be sure
hidden message and then if we made
another button and we assigned the
em-dash on so this is the M on directive
that we're looking at if the on click
event fires and we want to show the
hidden message and at this point in time
we don't need this outdoor call method
and I've made a little mistake inside of
our hidden message this should actually
be the bang this dot dollar data don't
show message and what this is it's of
course the data object inside of our
instance short message so if we save
this and for a fresh out page and if we
then click show message you can see that
a hidden message appears and then
disappears so this is becoming the
opposite of whatever the previous value
was
let's have a look at some other
directives and this could be loops so if
we for example had a list of names it's
not just Paul kitty Dave and finally
another one this one would be Tory so we
have a list of four people and we want
to display them on screen how do we do
that well inside of our index dot HTML
we can use something known as the M - 4
so for example we may have a ul and an
Li and if you've used angular before or
view before it's similar to v4 and ng 4
but instead we have an M - 4 and it here
we want to define what we want to refer
to each element inside of the array as
so named in names because remember names
is the name of our array and then we
want to bind to that name so if we
refresh the page you can see that we
then have Paul kiddie Dave and Terry all
on-screen because of M force and that's
essentially taking anything inside of
that array and then displaying it on
screen as many times as we want if we
wanted to we could even add more items
to this list hand side at the developer
console we could use app dot set and if
you remember F dot set is the way we add
things to our data objects we could add
things to the names array we get out of
commerce C then add a parameter we'd
have the current array which would be an
app dot dollar data don't names and if
we use three dots that will take each
person inside of the array and allow us
to then add a comma afterwards to add a
new person such as Sarah
so that essentially creates a new array
concatenates the old better with our new
data as you can see we then have Sarah
appear on screen if we refresh the page
a person disappears let's go back over
to our apt of GS and let's consider how
we might make a custom component so a
custom components can be done with moon
don't component that's making the
emptiness and this will be a Hello
component which will simply display the
word hello it's quite a simple one and
we can then add a comma a new javascript
object and inside of here we can define
things like a template a template at
this point in time we'll simply have a
paragraph tag or even h1 and it will
only say hello so a very simple
component and that component can then be
shown on screen I'm going to put
underneath the UL and Li with a hello
tag so that's right hello like that and
if we refresh our page we then have
hello on screen so already I can see a
thinking about how this can be used we
can then take features inside of our app
instance and we can separate these
things out into their own component so
how can we add things like property
types well outside of all yes we can
define some props let's define a name
prop and that will allow us to say hello
to a particular name so let's say hello
and we'll use interpolation binding
inside of our component to say hello to
that name we'll put a name in our
initial app instance of Paul and then
inside of our index dot HTML all we need
to do now is say hello name equals and
we'll bind to name and if you remember
that it says Paul and our app instance
and once we refresh this
we then see hell or Paul how then can we
determine when the component itself
wants to emit some data let's head back
over to all component and remember a
component can have things like data it
can have methods you know basically
anything that a standard moon instance
can have but let's make it so that if we
click a button so instead of a h1 we'll
have a button and that button will have
the hello name text like before but this
time when we use the M on click so when
this button is clicked we'll find a
method inside of our component which
will be alert user and the alert user
methods will not have any data or any
parameters although we'll do is admit
alert user so it's simply going to emit
alert user what we can then do is hook
into that by adding an em-dash on alert
user and passing this to a function
inside of our app instance so if we make
a new function we'll call it the same
thing alert user and we alert hello and
that will just simply alert hello on
screen we don't have to have the same
function name here as the name of our a
lot before we test this on the browser I
do want to say one thing and as that
data does need to return a method when
we make a new component
just have a couple of fixes here I'm
gonna remove the data at this point
because it is completely empty but do
keep that in mind you will need to make
that function if you aren't gonna use
data inside of the component and of
course for our methods well this is then
doing is emitting the alert user method
and I made this entirely law case and
I've matched the law case inside of our
index dot HTML so what then happens is
we are seeing em on for a lot user
that's simply matching for the alert
user emitted event we then calling alert
user at this point and then the alert
user itself is just simply displaying
hello and of course that's inside of our
app instance so when we refresh and we
select hello Paul that will then display
hello on screen so just keep in mind
when we're communicating between our app
instance and our component we want to
use em on on the component itself pass
in the emitted event name then on the
right hand side we want to pass in a
function that we want to call and that's
inside of the app instance and we do a
similar thing inside a ball component
but this time we use M on click and it's
here we omit the event using this dot
emit so that about wraps up a lot of the
basics of moon we're able to make
different things like components we're
able to add properties emit events look
at things like did our methods calling
them methods as well as directives here
inside of all indexed or HTML and much
