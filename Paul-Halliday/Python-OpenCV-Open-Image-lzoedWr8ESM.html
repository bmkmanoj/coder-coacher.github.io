with open CV 3 and Python so I have an
image right now named Paul but PNG and
that we have array there
what I'm going to do is going to open
this image with CV 2 so we can import CV
to and from here we can define an image
variable we can say that's equal to CB 2
dot I am read so we're reading in an
image we have to supply the file name
and that's going to be at image slash
Paul dot PNG and from here we can show
the image by saying CV 2 dots I am sure
and as you can see L first parameter is
a window nim so for the window and then
we'll simply say Paul and then the next
one will be that image so we can pass in
IMG so we can say read image show image
and now what we're going to do is going
to say C v2 dot weekee and this will
essentially just keep the window open so
it doesn't automatically disappear
so we'll say keep window open and if we
run this we do indeed get our image with
the title of Paul and of course
displayed here this is then removed if
we click a button so that's how we open
an image with open CV
and Python if you'd like to see more
open CV content let me know and in the
next coming videos are going to look at
things like color manipulation image
rotation and so on don't forget to hit
that subscribe button to stay updated
with more content and until next time my
name is Paul and I'll see you very soon
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
