display a list of tags so we have one
tag at this point in time and that tag
is getting started we can display that
on screen inside of this other column by
doing a very similar thing as before so
last time we used get posts and we put
this inside of a section we then display
this for the h3 and then looped over
this with an Li and a ul try and think
how we might do the same thing with tags
so go ahead and instead of getting posts
get tags and display these on screen in
the same way as we did before
so this UL and Li inside of the Li
should be our tags I'll give you a
little hint
instead of title for the tag name it's
actually nem let's go ahead and
implement that ourselves so what we need
to do is start off with a get school and
we want to get the tags and I'm going to
limit this to ten and we will call this
tags we'll close off I would get call
and inside if I would get caught we'll
have a section that section will have a
h3 of tags then we'll iterate over an li
by having if for each and we'll say for
each tags or can even say as tag so we
can say for each tag we can have an Li
which encompasses a air with the class
of tag and we'll put the H ref to URL
and the text of our anchor equal to name
if we save our file you can now see that
we have a list of tags at the bottom
here with a getting started if we select
getting started it takes us to all the
posts that have the getting started tag
if we were to add other tags to our
application these would all display
inside of the footer as we have a two
column layout if we were to make this
bigger you could see that it starts off
being on top of one another but as the
screen gets bigger
it takes up two columns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
