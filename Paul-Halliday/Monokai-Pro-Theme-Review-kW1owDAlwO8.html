theme I currently use inside of Visual
Studio chords well the theme I'm using
at the moment is monarch I Pro it is a
paid theme but don't run away because it
does offer a variety of different styles
as you can see there are a variety of
colors available inside of this theme
and of course they are used
nicely I do like the color palettes and
I do like how it's used we have
different color filters so as you can
see in a second we are going to look at
the different filters that are available
and how you can customize your theme
based on your current moods but in order
to get this theme you may want to go
over to Molokai dope raw I do suggest
that you check it out over on a vs chord
before hands and then if you like you go
through and purchase it so you can see
it right here let's jump into vs chord
and install B theme so inside the vs
chord let's hit the extensions button
and inside the extensions let's search
for mono kai prole the first result
should be the monarch I theme by mono
kai and you can go down take a look at
the description but more importantly you
can hit the install button now I have
this installed hence why it says
uninstall but hit install and then you
can add this to your project so I've
opened up a project which I've been
working on as part of the angular course
that I'm currently creating and at the
moment you can see we have a fairly nice
styled theme it interacts very well with
operator monal the font that I use and
in order to change the theme we can hit
command P and have to imagine it's ctrl
P on Windows and then we can say color
theme I'm using the filter octagon at
this moment in time but you will start
off by looking at the original mono Kai
Pro as you can see we have a brown theme
and this offers us vibrant colors but
more ever brown shades we have a more
green shade but the colors are still
vibrant the octagon is my favorite it's
yellow but does offer a lot
vibrancy we also have ristretto which is
a darker brown and the colors are
vibrant but they do seem to be dulled a
little bit and then we have spectrum
which is an even dollar version but the
colors are much more vibrant and at this
moment in time that's all the filters
that are available with the mana Chi pro
package so I'm still evaluating my theme
choice at this moment in time so that
means every time I open up bs chords or
at least now and then I do get a pop-up
which says I should purchase the premium
version of monic I Pro so why not try
outs monic i pro insider vs chord or
sublime text let me know what theme
you're using inside of the comment
section below
I'd like to try out some different
themes but at the moment I am enjoying
this one until next time my name is Paul
and I'll see you very soon in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
