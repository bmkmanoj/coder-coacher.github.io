video we're gonna like at the various
different mobile application development
frameworks tools and technologies in
2017 so I want to start off with ionic
and the webview best frameworks so as
you may already be aware I on ik
framework is based on angular and it
allows us to make powerful and locations
with our angular codes now one of the
benefits of this have we haven't just
had explore the documentation is that
ionic is really easy to get up and
running with quickly so if we wanted
something like an action sheet we could
just simply hit your action sheet here
get a demo onto the ionic framework site
and then just simply take this chord
here and place it inside of our
application and it just works now one of
the great things about this is that in
most cases unless you're using some sort
of native thing that doesn't work in the
browser the application will just work
out of the box on the mobile device as
well as a web browser so you can take
the projects that you build with ionic
and you can place them straight on the
browser on a website without any issue
now this does come with a drawback and
the drawback is is that it's a bit
harder to make native integrations when
compared to some other frameworks like
native scripts but it's certainly not
impossible if you want to get started
with Cordova based development there is
ways that you can do that relatively
easy but it's just another learning
curve other things like performance have
been mentioned before things like ionic
I personally haven't found too much of a
bad performance issue with the framework
itself it's more just specific
limitations of the webview in places
where you really shouldn't be using a
webview based app if you're really
looking for complex 3d graphics or maybe
just thousands of things on the screen
then you know ionic does offer things
like the virtual scroll for thousands of
things on the screen at least but as far
as the complex 3d graphics well you know
there's probably better things out there
than using html5 for that anywhere
so as far as performance scores I think
really we're gonna see a lot more of
this as the time goes on with
progressive web apps and the web just
getting more powerful we have things
like knit of share now and the web
payment API all of these sort of
progressive at web application features
aren't gonna push the web forwards in
the coming months and yes I think it's
really important to just not write off a
frameworks like ionic just because they
use a webview
I think the web is allowing us to make
applications that lourd up in literally
milliseconds rather than waiting a few
seconds in some circumstances for native
applications what about locations seem
to be much smaller when bundled too and
that seems to be the way of the future
but there are other options and I do
recommend that you try them all so the
next thing we're going to look at is of
course things like framework 7 this is
another HTML based framework that allows
us to build hybrid mobile application
and web apps good thing about frameworks
um that does have things like view and
react options I think really in order to
survive as a mobile application
framework in today's sort of market you
really need to be building things with
web components and allowing that to be
cross-platform this does go back to
things like ionic 4 and the stencil
compiler which allows us to make mobile
applications with web components and
very very quickly
from what I've heard you should find out
the performance does go up quite a bit
when the building things with stencil
and as well as that it just works
cross-platform out with a box everywhere
so back to framework seven you will find
a lot of similarities to ionic here we
have iOS and material themes as well as
things like nav bars pull the Refresh
and all the components that you've come
to expect from a cross-platform
framework
I recommend you try them both out you
may find that you like one more than the
other but I think it's really just one
of the same catagory at this point other
interesting applications and frameworks
that you may be interested in are things
like quiz our framework this allows you
to build applications and websites and
even electron based applications all
with the same codebase
powered by view you have different
things like the material theme and iOS
team all with a vast amount of
components that allow you to get up and
running with web applications super
quickly
and then we start to get to the other
side of the spectrum we're now building
applications with JavaScript still but
now we're able to use things like
angular and typescript to build native
applications so why would you use native
script over something like ionic well
there's a few reasons why you may want
to consider that I'm not saying any of
these things that are the best a choice
for you that depends on your team and
that's something I'm gonna say a lot
throughout this video is that as
honestly depends a lot about where the
skills are inside of your team and what
the business requirements are for your
application now there are ways to build
at the same native script application
out with an angular code base for the
web and for native that is possible I
have actually made a course which may be
released it may not be at this point
depending on when this video gets
released over at native scripting com
that's Alex this can cite an idea and
she have already in ng rx course Alba
which was using native script and ng rx
that will be updated very soon but I did
want to get this angular application for
both web and native course with knit a
script out there first so reason why you
may want to use native script is that
you literally just need that native
performance for whatever reason the
components that you develop with your
native script application are entirely
native so when we're building a level
inside of our native script apps
it is a literal level for iOS and
Android it's not simply a hedge one or a
label tag in HTML
we're also able to integrate things like
griddle and cocoa pods plugins
relatively easy with little stress and
we have things like typescript to help
us with that so we're able to interface
with this all native environments within
our java scripts and typescript very
very easy
again you can take advantage of the
skills that you already know so you can
get started with typescript and angular
and you can basically reuse your skills
from ionic with neither script very
simply I think that's just worth trying
everything if you try all native script
and you find that you like it more than
ionic then the gorath native script I'm
a big fan of native script I use it in a
lot of my projects I teach a lot of
courses around native script I'm also
big fan of ionic just both platforms and
both frameworks allow you to have
different sort of strengths and
weaknesses in different scenarios
if I'm building an app for the web well
a lot of the times I'll just run
straight to ionic to get things
prototyped really quickly if I really
want to go for a big release and
potentially there's some iOS and Android
SDKs that I want to interface with on
the native device but I can't find a
Cordova plug-in for then native script
offers me a little bit of an easier sort
of way of interacting with those SDKs so
in all circumstances I'm definitely go
with native script but like I said it
depends what you want and what your
project needs I definitely put native
scripts is most likely one of the best
sort of mobile application frameworks
when it comes to developing things with
angular next we have things like
Appcelerator now up stellarator allows
us to write our JavaScript once again
and take advantage of that native codes
I really haven't used Appcelerator too
much so I can't really go into the
specifics and I really want to make too
much of an opinion without sort of
having a justification why
so what I would recommend is that
potentially you check it out you see
whether it works for you when the
platform is sort of stable from your
point of view and it's something you
like to use if it is then jump on board
it may be perfect for you and your team
it might not be
we then go on to things like need of
development so this is literally just
developing something for iOS or
developing something for Androids and
that also comes with its benefits so
this allows you to have full control
over the platforms that you're
developing for a lot of the other
products of looked at so far allow you
to have a lot of control I mean we can
even go back to things like native
script that allows us to have a native
application and spoiler with CSS now
that's really important styling some
with CSS for native is actually quite
fun but we do run into slight
limitations you may find that look
there's just something you really want
to do with iOS and it might not be is
easy on my know B as possible with near
the script but you certainly can't do
with in native application at least
that's as far as styling goals and that
really does depend on your business
requirements
another reason that you may wanna
interface was something like Xcode to
develop iOS applications rather than
cross-platform is maybe the first reason
perhaps your client only wants an iOS
app
secondly you may want to integrate
things like the Apple watch with your
iPhone application it's not really
possible with a lot of the
cross-platform frameworks at this point
and you may just find that where you're
living a lot of the jobs are actually
more iOS than cross-platform so really
it's gonna depend on once again your
team where you're at where you are in
your development career and what you
really want to focus on perhaps you just
like iOS and you know everything about
iOS and you want to be an iOS developer
go do that nobody's stopping you I
really think it's it comes down a lot to
what you want to do and this or maybe
you like Swift and more than angular or
JavaScript or anything like that and you
really want to sort of dive into that
ecosystem go ahead if that's what makes
you happy at the end of the day do that
next we have things like Android stevia
on that does allow us to create native
applications with Java or Colin
you want to run into the same things as
the native iOS development at this point
you can only really develop for the one
platform but you have tight integration
with all Android devices so maybe things
like the Android TV the Android auto the
Android where you're going to be
developing applications that interface
with those devices across those
different sort of applications
perhaps once again are you just a big
fan of material design and the way
everything works maybe you just want to
be an Android developer that's totally
cool and may just be once again where
you live there's not really many jobs
around for the cross-platform stuff and
it's something that you want to do
instead
I definitely recommend you try it out
you might find that you know the end of
the day don't really want to develop for
any other platform and there's no
pressure to do that if you're happy
where you are and this is something you
want to do then go ahead and do NIT of
development
then we run into things like fuse which
uses JavaScript but uses this UX sort of
declarative markup and I really am a big
fan of the web fuse allows us to make
applications that look nice that feel
nice and uh nice to develop we have
things like the few studio which has
tight integration with all of the tools
within fuse so we have this sort of
layout of things similar to X cords and
we have these sort of different panels
here on the side so this does allow you
to make cross-platform applications with
JavaScript and the UX markup language I
do have a course on fuse that you can
check out a Paul holiday dial if you'd
like to get started developing apps for
fuse and like I said I'm a big fan of
the way this works creating animated
user interfaces with fuse is relatively
easy I mean if we just lock up this
piece of markup here we can see that we
have a circle which has the color of
green width of height of 50 and has thus
killing of a factor of x 3 so this
allows us to scale the circle by a
factor of 3 we find that inside of the
markup itself it's easy to say exactly
what you want rather than how to do it
so we want to skill us a circle by a
factor of 3 it will simply do that we
can add other things like timing
elements to this rotations translation X
of Y at 0
we can also look at how we can use
third-party SD cares with fuse as well
as a lot of native integration so if we
look at things like the camera super
simple camera they'll take picture at
Sarah so we are able to use JavaScript
once again to make native cross-platform
applications of course at this point
fuse is not as big as the other
platforms and I really would like to see
this grow so if you're a big fan of fuse
let me know show me the stuff that
you've made inside of the comments I'd
love to see what you've made with fuse
and what you're currently thinking about
making on this platform another thing
that we have is things like react native
and react native allows us to make
JavaScript based applications with react
across iOS and Android
now this is another one of the really
popular front-end tools to develop
applications with JavaScript and react
so I would recommend this if you like
the way of react works and you're a fan
of react then react native is most
likely going to be the project that you
just run to straightaway see one of the
big things about working with the
angular frameworks is that you know at
the end of the day you most likely like
angular and that's the reason why you're
doing it is because you know underneath
the hood you using angular every day
simply just using most parts a UI
library with things like ionic and
obviously does provide things like
routing as well so I'm not really trying
to subsidize that into simply just being
a UI library but you understand that at
the end of the day you're using it
because you're a fan of angular and the
most parts when it comes to using react
native you're most likely a fun and you
like to use react native in the chord
that you're right oh I should say react
rather you like to use react on a day to
day basis so once again like I said we
can take advantage of native UI
components with a sort of react native
we have access to different API so we
have things like the camera roll once
again here inside we are native as well
as documentation on how to use this so
once again it's quite simple
implementation camera rolled on your
photos and you can find a lot of the
things that do come with these sort of
frameworks and tools is that we have
subsidized a lot of the features that
you would need to access in its standard
business application things like the
camera roll alerts animations etc are
all usually really easy to access and a
lot of that work has already been done
for you you'll find that real native
applications are very performant and are
used in industry quite a bit it is gonna
be a framework that you should spend
time learning if you want to use react
and you do like react you should find
that you should be able to get some jobs
in this industry and it would be a good
choice for you if you're interested in
using react so it does have a lot of big
backers we have obviously Facebook the
Facebook adverts yeah things like
Instagram so a lot of the Facebook stuff
obviously uses that but also all things
like air B&amp;amp;B which is a big pioneer and
a lot of the JavaScript stuff we have
Skype Tesla
Walmart's so a lot of the big companies
are using this and then vesting in this
technology so you certainly can't go
wrong if you like react when it comes to
developing cross-platform stuff with
react native finally I'm going to end on
xamarin now xamarin has been around for
a while and it does allow us to use
things like c-sharp to of course make
applications for Android and iOS so this
is gonna be another thing if your team
is sort of a lot of the enterprise based
so companies are using c-sharp and so
Microsoft stuff for the backends you may
find that xamarin just works well in
that sort of area for you and your
company so once again a lot of the
things I teach and a lot of the things
that I work on I'm not really based on a
c-sharp or anything like that so most of
the stuff that I do at this point is
simply just JavaScript front-end
back-end base stuff but all usually in
the JavaScript ecosystem so what's gonna
happen really spent too much time with
xamarin by I'm actually looking to spend
a bit more time with that so I can sort
of maybe teach them the stuff maybe you
can learn with me on the channel so they
don't really have too much to say about
other than if you're using c-sharp in
your company on your industry it's the
skills that you like then your team is
most likely going to want to try some
run before the other frameworks and
tools and a lot less if you know some
the answers always coming down to the
same thing as hey it really depends on
what your company's skills are it's
pointless
retraining an entire organization team
whatever it is to this other platform if
you could simply just take advantage of
the skills people already have a lot of
the time it just comes down to sort of
marginal percentage differences on just
how much you can do with these different
frameworks and tools if your gods are
using c-sharp and it's what your team
uses then I'd most likely just run two
straight using xamarin and then you
don't have to spend a lot of time money
and effort so training up this whole
team if the are sort of industry based
I mean xamarin is backed by Microsoft
and used by law of enterprise companies
so at the end of the day don't waste
your time rescaling if you don't have to
what's my conclusion in all of this with
luck to everything from things like
ionic framework to stencil to framework
7 all the way to things like native
scripts and fuse and Sarah well my
answer to that would be do whatever
makes you happy I would try every one of
the frameworks that you're interested in
so if you're interested in maybe using
ionic because you've looked at the
documentation and you think you know
this could be for me try it in a few
projects I have lots of videos on how
you can get started I even just released
a course on how you can get started with
ionic and firebase here on the channel
try it out it may be perfect for you in
other circumstances maybe native script
is better
maybe you're just more comfortable with
integrating with something like native
Android and iOS SDKs and api's but you
want that cross-platform approach go
with native script
try that it might be good for you am I
not
and obviously if you only want to
develop for one platform well I mean the
choice is already there for your isn't
if you want to develop for iOS web and
you know you stop with developing for
iOS with Xcode
that might be something that you like it
might be something that you don't like
recommend you try that as well same goes
for Android studio on when it comes to
tools like fuse I would definitely check
that out if you're interested in sort of
making sort of declarative user
interfaces with the UX markup and you
really want to take advantage of the
60fps animations the easy layout and
interfacing with sort of native api's I
definitely recommend you check out fuse
Fleur and you have things like the
examples here which teach you quite a
few things you know how to use pretty
much everything how to make it sort of
list item to detailed view which creates
the sort of animation I mean you can't
really argue with that it's good
animation and it teaches you how to do
the full thing with the full example so
maybe fuse is the set of tools for you I
do have a course over at Paul holiday
dot IO which teaches you how to make
mobile applications with fuse or maybe
react native is what you want if you
like react then I would definitely just
jump straight into react native you
don't have to rescale up you don't have
to learn anything
I'll just definitely dive into that try
it out see whether it's for you if it's
not then you know at least you've
learned something new if it is there you
go
and of course if c-sharp is for you then
xamarin is most likely the choice that
you're going to want to make
so my conclusion after all of that is
simply to if you have skills already for
example in angular or react try those
frameworks first if that doesn't work
out for you
I mean don't even think about
performance don't think about anything
for now just simply think about making
applications and user experiences
don't be married to the framework at all
just simply if you're good at these
things already try those tools and
frameworks if that works for you perfect
if it doesn't consider other options the
worst case scenario and all of this is
that you've learned something new
so that's my review of the various
different mobile frameworks and tools
I'd love for you to tell me why I'm
right or even why I'm wrong inside of
