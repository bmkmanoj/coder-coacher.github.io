tutorial today we're going to lock
buttons within Kendall UI for angular if
you haven't watched the setup guide
called you that now prior to this video
ensure that you've installed the
following packages inside of your
project we'll need the buttons package
the localization package and of course
the angular animations package let's now
open the project inside of Visual Studio
chords and inside of your art module
ensure that you've imported the buttons
module from Kendall angular buttons and
your browser animations module from
angular platform browser slash
animations import these both inside of
our routes ng module and then we can
continue with the tutorial so the first
thing that we'll do is we will make it
button inside of all project on the
button or simply say Kendall UI button
you can see it's just a button elements
like you would expect inside app HTML if
we save the file we do of course get a
standard button to make this button a
Kendall UI button we first have to add
the Kendall button attributes and by
doing so it becomes a Kendall UI button
but at this point you might not have any
styling on your button at all and that's
because we need to install the Kendall
UI theme that can be done by saying NPM
install - - save add progress slash
Kendall - theme - default now in order
to access these and progress packages I
would suggest looking at the first video
in Kendall UI as this details how to
access that NPM registry so once you've
installed the Kendall theme we can now
enter your that our Kendall theme is
added to our Styles s CSS now you must
of course be using an SES s project at
this point and of course we can import
that progress slash Kendall theme
default slash se SS slash all now if we
check inside of google chrome we can see
our new Kendall UI styled button it's
very big on my screen because I'm super
zoom in so let's take a look at actually
adding some color to our button to do
that we can add the primary attribute
and say primary is equal to true
and if we save the file now we get our
primary color with some white text so
our button that now becomes this orange
red color so we'll copy this element and
I'll add it here without the primary so
we can see the difference between them
both so we have the two buttons here as
well but we also have another sphere for
our button we have the disabled speed so
let's take the primary button and let's
say disabled is equal to true and as you
can see our button becomes a lot less
faded out to show the user that they
can't click the button so I'm going to
h1 on top of here that says button but
we also have something called a button
group so you see we have these buttons
let's have a look at button groups or h1
button group and we can access this
button group by wrapping it inside of a
Kendall button a group so let's type
Kendall - button group and let's now add
a list of buttons so we can have three
buttons or as many as you want I'm going
to say this is button 1 this is button -
and this is button 3 each one will have
the Kendall button attribute as you can
see now we have a button group they are
aligned together as three buttons and we
can click each one of them when you have
button groups like this well you may
want to have a toggle above function so
we could if we want to add the
toggleable attributes sort of a toggle
as equal to true let's add that
unbuttoned - for now
for click button 3 button 1 but then if
we click button 2 we'll see that it sort
of stays in in this toggleable mod we
could of course add this to all of our
buttons but for now I'm going to leave
it on button 2 let's now take a like it
add drop-down buttons so drop-down
buttons within Kendal and we can access
that with the Kendall drop-down button
so for now we could simply put something
here like drop-down got them and if we
save the file we'll see that we have a
button that says standard button looks
the same as all of the rest but when we
click it nothing happens at the moment
because we need to add some drop-down
data in order to add the drop-down bit
or I'm simply going to add an
you a rare inside of our components
we'll call les drop down data and that
will be in a rare of time any and from
with inside of the area will simply give
it some text elements so we can say text
option one text option 2 text option 3
if we then head back to our Ken door
drop down button we can add the data for
this button drop down by seeing the data
arrow key here is equal to the drop down
data and the drop down theater is of
course inside of our of component es if
we then click the drop down button we do
get the option one option two and option
3 if we wanted to add a click event to
this for example when somebody clicks
the item we can access that with item
click and from within here we can put an
expression so let's add a new function
that's named item was clicked and we can
take in event as a parameter here and
you can do whatever you like obviously
with inside of your button click but for
now will simply say console dot log and
will log out the event so we can say I
son was clicked and pass in at the event
data if we open our console and we click
our drop down button and then select one
of these items we do get the text of
option two if we wanted we could add
more stuff to our area such as ID one
and perhaps some other things like user
options X Y and Zed if we were to click
drop down number two would you of course
get our user options array our ID and
obviously our text another thing that we
can take a look at is the split button
and we can use the Kendall - split
button components and for now I'm so
we're going to keep the same a drop down
data so the data is equal to the drop
down data within the split button and
instead we're going to say split button
for the button text and as you can see
we have this button here but we also
have this button options but we can
click and get different
and from within our split button so
ideally perhaps we want to have some
functionality for this split button if
we click it but we also want to offer
the user some other functionality within
our list we can use the item click
method for whenever an item was clicked
inside of our split button
so once the an we'll pass in our item
was quite function and the event but we
can also access when the split button
was clicked itself this is the button
that's to the left of the options and
there's of course the button click
attribute so let's write a function and
the function is going to be button that
was clicked and we can simply console
the log the button was clicked so let's
add this to be button click attribute so
we can said button was clicked and if we
check inside of our application if we
click the split button we get the button
was clicked and of course if we click
one of the options we get the various
options that's come along with the split
button we'll take a locket icons in more
detail in the future but for now we can
also add an icon to any one of our
buttons we can do that by adding the
icon attributes and passing in an icon
from kendo UI icons as well as this one
are only limited to the kendo UI icons
we can pass in our own but for now I'm
simply going to pass in the lock icon
you'll see that our kendo UI button now
has that lock icon to the left of the
text so that should be a high-level
overview of how to use a lot of the
button elements within Kendyl UI for
angular if you like this I need want to
see more kendo UI videos then of course
hit that subscribe button and let me
know inside of the comment section below
until next time my name is Paul and I'll
see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
