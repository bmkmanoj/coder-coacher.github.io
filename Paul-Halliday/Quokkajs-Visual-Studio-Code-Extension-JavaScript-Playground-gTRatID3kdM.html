attention to quokka GS now this is a
plugin for visual studio called and be
jetbrains ide and from within this
plugin we essentially have alive scratch
pad for JavaScript as they call it this
essentially means that anything that we
do within the scratch pads were
instantly given the results for so for
example on screen right now you can see
an example of this we can see the result
and then the result is a hundred and we
see that within our editor if there is
old changes that takes changes next to
that variable this is really good if you
want to see the results of your chord
instantly inside of the editor so let's
take a look at this inside of es chords
so I've got a visual studio chord
instance open and I'm going to head over
to the extensions and in the extension C
you can see that we have something
called conquered OGS you'd have to type
that into the extensions a search bar
and then install it into your vs chords
once you've done that reload vs chord
and we should be ready to go I'm going
to hit command P and from here we can
select it some actions and I've got to
say quokka GS and from within quagga
dodge yes we want to generate a new type
script file by doing that what we have
now is the terminal at the bottom that
appeared that a said Crocker is running
and it's same with running typescript 2
3 2 and anything we type in here will be
instantly evaluated so let's try this
out if we had a Const and that constant
was named boolean and that was equal to
true if we were to log that boolean we
would get true
let's make something a little more
interesting so let's say we have this
array of so I'm going to say Const my
area and this array is going to be an
absolute mess so inside of the array
will have a value named my nested value
and this value will be nested quite deep
inside of an array
so let's nest but like that and what we
want to do is write a function that will
unnecessarily so we can say constant on
wrap and unwrap will take in a rail it
will check to see whether the input is
in a rail if it is in a row we'll call
unwrap once again on itself passing it
the array 0 inside of the parameter so
this as the next nest down otherwise if
it's not an array and it's a string such
as my nested value we will return the
value so we've got these different
colors going down the side such as the
green and the umber if we were to then
say unwrap my array you can see that the
function goes from being unused a number
to now being green because it's being
used so unwrapping the array let's log
it out to see the results of that and to
the right of our unwrap function we can
see that it is my nest at value if we
change this to b1 we would have one two
three or an object named Paul age twenty
five and so on we could continue to wrap
this in more arrays and always we would
get our unwraps function each time if we
then make a mistake for example if we're
to remove this my array we now see my
array is not defined so this is much
quicker than running it in the browser
so this is a small example to quokka but
i hope you find it useful in your
projects and use it as a good live
scratch pads the creators of quokka also
have something called wallaby which you
can use in a similar sense but for your
unit tests that one is Pitt and Crockett
could be paired in the future but for
now it's completely free if you like
this video then of course hit that
subscribe button check out quokka and
until next time my name is Paul and I'll
see you very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
