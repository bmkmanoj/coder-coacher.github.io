at to using the toolbar inside of our
quasar framework applications so let's
make a new application and head over to
hell or view that's inside the source
folder and then components let's remove
everything inside of this file and make
ourselves in new templates and in new
script inside of our script we can
export a default object but we'll leave
this blank for this moment inside of our
template what we want to do is make a
new cue - toolbar and inside of our
toolbar I'm simply going to give this a
title by using the Q - toolbar
- title inside of the Q toolbar title we
can give it the name of home this could
potentially be the home page for this
component and of course therefore we're
displaying err contextual toolbar seeing
home after which we need to import the
toolbar inside of our script so the way
that we do that is by saying import from
quiz R and the things that we're looking
to import is the Q toolbar and the Q
toolbar title inside of our default
object what we need to do is specify
these components by saying components
and then pass in the Q toolbar and q2 or
one title once again if we save this and
look at our application we can then see
that we have this toolbar on-screen the
toolbar does their home and of course
you can customize this to say whatever
you want until what is currently blue
and that's because of the main color is
primary but we can if we worship select
a different color for example on our
toolbar we can add the color equal to
secondary and intima you will see that
we do get that standard green with the
secondary color palette inside of our
quiz our applications could do
everything from positive to get that
bright green in full
so you get that light blue and so on we
do have other options for this I'm going
to copy this toolbar and we're going to
add it again underneath and I will
surround this inside of a div but this
time we'll make the toolbar inverted so
we can add the word inverted to our q
toolbar but in this circumstance you can
see that the toolbar still takes up the
same amount of space but instead of the
background color being blue it's the
text that that is blue and of course the
background color is white if we wish we
could also add a subtitle to our toolbar
gonna add it to the initial toolbar that
we created inside if you aren't going to
make is fun and the way that we add is
subtitles by adding what is known as a
slot and this is used on content
inserted in the child components so
these slots that we're going to be
pushing in here is known as the subtitle
and this will be my subtitle so if we
take a look inside of our application we
have the home which is denoted by the
cue toolbar title and underneath that
new subtitle what we just created we can
do the same for our inverted toolbar and
when we do the same for the inverted so
while we do get the same effect but of
course this time it doesn't have a
background color another thing that we
can do to change the appearance of our
toolbar is to add what is known as a
glossy effect I'm going to copy this and
paste it once again just so we can see
the difference and I'm going to add it
on top of our current toolbar and we're
going to use the prop glossy
we simply are after the color so you can
see that the toolbar does male have a
sort of glossy effect with the shadow
underneath so this offers a variety of
different styles for your tool bar we
can also add buttons to our toolbar we
simply head back over to our scripts we
can elect to import the queue button and
of course add it to the components that
we wish to use and then inside of our
toolbar I'm going to use the glossy one
at this moment in time we can also add a
button so let's add the queue button
this one can simply say hello and inside
of our toolbar we therefore have that
button usually though it's a good idea
to only add icon only buttons to our
toolbar so let's have a look at how we
can use an icon inside of our toolbar
this time I'm going to add the icon to
the standard block toolbar so underneath
the title once again and this time we'll
need to head back over to our script and
import what is known as the queue icon
that's not the queue icon to the left of
components and let's add the button but
this time inside of the button we can
add a queue icon and the queue icon that
we'll use we can potentially use
something like the gamepad's why not we
should also add the button attributes of
flat and when we take a look here at our
toolbar we can now see that we do have
this button so the button next time is
flat and obviously when we click on our
button we do get that nice ripple effect
so that's about everything that wraps up
the toolbar inside of our Queens our
framework applications if you have fun
this useful but of course hit that
subscribe button to stay updated let me
know what you think inside of the
comment section below and of course
