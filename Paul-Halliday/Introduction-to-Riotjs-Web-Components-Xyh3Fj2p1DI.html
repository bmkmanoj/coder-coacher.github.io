look at making a UI components with
Riots GS so right allows us to
essentially make custom HTML tags and of
course assign scripts and styles to
those tags so it's quite similar to
making a component in other frameworks
but this is exceptionally lightweight
and has next tune or boilerplate
so let's start up by making a new file
and I'm going to call this snazzy -
timer tag now you can use any file
extension that you want but don't tag is
standard for riot so we're going to use
that and the name of our tag is simply
going to be snazzy timer so essentially
we start off by writing the name of the
tag
and from here we can go down and start
defining the view so inside of our view
I'm going to have we've been counting
four and then a particular amount of
time so after that we can define a set
of styles and any scripts that we want
to write so let's first look at the
styles that we want to create inside of
our tag so let's start by making a scope
tank and inside the scope we can make
our text read because if we want it to
be super smoothie it has the style being
read let's also add a font size of 100
pixels and then go to create an
animation so let's make some keyframes
and our keyframe animation will be
called snubs and it simply if 50% will
have the color be blue so we'll navigate
from red to blue and we'll do that over
a particular duration so let's add
animation snazz over three seconds want
it to be linear and run infinitely
awesomesauce ourselves up an animation
now we simply need to add a script so
there is a tutorial for Rio chess that
has quite similar chords but all this
essentially is is an interval so you can
start off by defining our time and the
time variable at this point is simply
what we're binding to here inside of our
paragraph tag so we're essentially
saying this tour time is equal to zero
after that we are going to create a set
interval function and in each interval
for each second we want to upgrade or
increment our time by one so let's make
a function called tink and inside of
here we want to update time and simply
increment it by one super simple so all
we need to do after that is to define a
timer by saying set interval pass enter
the tick function and do it every second
so now every second our time is going to
be updated to include the new time
also with riots that when we unmount or
when this component is destroyed we want
to ensure that we clear the interval so
the interval is not kept thinking when
we're not using this component so we can
say this dot on and we can pass in the
unmount event and when it does unmount
all need to do is clear interval for
that timer
so everything is fair least
as you can see all we have is this
interval which is upgrading the time by
1 when the component is finished we
simply want to cleave that interval so
what we need to do now is add this to
our indexed or HTML so let's add a
script with the source of snazzy timer
tank and the type is going to be riot
slash tag this tells the riot compiler
now this is actually a tag and what we
also want to do is add a script to mount
this script to the Dom so riots don't
mount and then pass in this snazzy timer
the final thing to do is actually to add
this to our Dom so let's add our snazzy
timer and if we check this out inside of
our browser I'm going to run this with
HTTP server we can see that our snazzy
timer changes in color and of course
increments in time so it's sort of a fun
take on a counter and was achieved
fairly easily you can imagine if you had
a full application like this I think in
new component is super simple and like I
said this makes the no boiler plan so if
you want to add more components or more
functionality you can also scorp
everything so it's inside that component
and we'll look at all those things in
future videos so riot if it's something
you want to see on the channel so we've
made our first components with riot yes
