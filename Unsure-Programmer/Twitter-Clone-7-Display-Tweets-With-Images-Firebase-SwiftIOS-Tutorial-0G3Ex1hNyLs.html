attach images with our tweets in this
tutorial we'll display those images
along with our twits as you can see in
front of us we have the images along
with the tweet if we click on an image
it enlarges the image if you click on it
again and dismisses the image so let's
begin as always for people who have not
been able to follow along in this video
series the starter project files for
this particular video and the completed
project files of this particular video
are available on github the link for the
same is given below the video in the
description so coming to the main
storyboard I aim is to insert an image
view between this suite view and the
stack view so select the table view cell
and let's increase its size to 190
select the stack view and bring it down
let's update the constraints now let's
insert an image view between this
control tracking the image view to the
to eat wheel and apply vertical spacing
control drag apply leading trailing and
add the constraints so that the width of
the image view is equal to the tweet
will also control drag from the image
view to the stack view to add vertical
spacing towards the bottom what we'll
also do is we set the height of the
image view to be fixed at 77 so we'd add
the constraint and one more thing we
need to do is we need to add the bottom
constrain for the stack view so let's
select the stack view in control drag to
the container view and set bottom space
to contain imagine let's give this a
default image of the suit's wallpaper
and aspect fill and also we enable user
interaction and we clip sub views so
that the image does not overflow out of
the box now coming to the tweet view
let's select that we do and deselect
scrolling enabled from its attributes
this will ensure that the tweet view
expands as the text inside it increases
also coming to its constraints delete
the constraint that limits inside 248
since we have a top
constraint and a bottom constraint to
the stack view the size will
automatically increase now let's run
this and see if our layout is working as
you can see the image is not displaying
exactly as it should and everything else
is getting compressed or cut out let's
fix this come to the view did load
method you basically need to add two
lines of code soft at home table view
dot row height is equal to UI tableview
automatic dimension and self taught
tableview not estimated row height is
equal to let's say approximately 140
Maisie when you set the row height as
your table for your automatic dimension
the table view is told to you will see
auto layout constraints and contents of
itself to determine each cells height by
giving it an estimated row height we
reduce the workload of the app because
it doesn't have to calculate an
arbitrary value itself it knows that
it's approximately gonna be around 140
and it improves the performance of a
table view so now let's run this and see
it should be fixed as you can see now
the image is displaying nicely if we
come down we have this street which is a
random tweet but it is very long but
that is also getting displayed perfectly
now that we have our image view
displaying perfectly let's get the image
that the users uploaded along with the
tweet and display that I start by going
to the home view table view cell let's
create an outlet for the image let's
call it tweet image also create an
outlet for the height of the image so
let's call this image view height
constraint I'll tell you why we need
this later coming back to the home view
controller we need to start by checking
if the tweet has an image so for that
let's copy this line of code here we
will say if tweets self-taught which dot
count to get the last one first dot
value will go for picture this time and
we'll check if this is not equal to
equal to nil then we will say let
picture equal to same line of code
picture and we will force downcast as a
string
they will say let you are equal to NS
URL string and will put in the picture
then we'll just give it a nice border
radius
you
so we basically gave it a corner radius
of ten we give it a border width of
three and then we gave it a border color
of white color now remember we had
created that outlets of the height
constrain so here in the else block will
say if there is no image we'll say self
dot tweet image dot hidden equal to true
this will hide the image view but it
still occupies space in our layout so
what we have to do is a self dot image
view height constraint dot constant
equal to zero but since their cells are
being reused we have to make sure that
when the image does exist the cell dot
weed image view is visible that is
hidden is equal to false and cell dot
image view height constrain dot constant
is equal to we have to create a default
value for the height constraint so
coming to the top over here we create a
variable called default image view
height constrain of types CG float and
we give it a value equal to the height
of the image which is 77 come down here
and say that if the image exists set set
aside to default image view height
constraint now you may have noticed that
we still haven't set the image for the
tweet image view that is because we want
to download the image asynchronously and
for that we'll use a library called SD
web image I'll put the link of this
library in the description below this is
amazing and helps us not only download
images asynchronously but also caches
the image for us and improves the
performance of our table view which
otherwise would be quite buggy if we try
to do it ourselves
basically to install this we can come
down to the installation section we can
use cocoapods as we have been doing
let's copy this line of code over here
we'll come into the project folder in
the terminal open up the pod file at the
bottom with at that line of code exit
out and the save pod install before we
use it we just need to build our project
so that project in detector library so
press command B to build the project
once the build is succeeded we can
import SD web image and now we can
display our image with just one line of
code say self dot tweet image force
unwrap that dot SD underscore set image
set image with URL and we'll use this
one which has the NS URL which we'll
call URL as you've already converted it
here and for the placeholder image we
just say UI image named and we'll just
give it a default code icon let's run
this and see now as we can see we are
seeing the image come up as we expected
but the cells without the image are not
collapsing let's go fix this
so come here click on the stack view
come to the constraints you'll notice
that the stack view has a constraint
which says top space to create equals 81
if you remember when we had moved to
stack view down
we had updated the constraints which
caused this constraint to be created
basically how this constraint is doing
is it's always trying to maintain a
distance of 81 from the TWiT view which
is not what we want when the image
collapses so let's delete this out let's
try this out huh as you can see now the
day that the tweets that have an image
are showing the image and the ones that
do not have an image are nicely
collapsed one last thing that we need to
do is allow the user to tap on the image
in the tweet and view a larger version
of that image we'll do that by adding a
tab just to recognizer to the image so
let's do that let's create the
recognizer called let image tap equal to
UI table - recognizer target will be
self action will be
it's a selector when method that will
create is what we called it tap media in
to it and all I just create this method
before we create that method let's add
this to a tweet image image tap and now
let's create this method coming here at
the bottom this method is dead tap media
in tweet like we mentioned sender is
going to be a UI tap gesture recognizer
and inside this the code we need is the
same code that we put in in the me view
controller here we run out the user to
view a bigger profile picture so they
just copy this it's inside the view
picture action that we created in the
dip tab profile picture method so let's
copy this
come back to the home view controller
and paste this in here so we create the
image view we set the new image view
equal to the image view dot image set
the frame equal to the self set a
background color content mode enable
user interaction and also add another
gesture to the larger image to dismiss
that image when the user taps on it
again for that let us create the method
here it's going to be called dismiss
full screen image and again Center will
be of UI tap gesture recognizer and all
this will do is it's a send out or view
toward remove from soup of it all that
has gone now and we can try this out
here we have the tweets with the image
let's tap it as you can see that the
image has become bigger tapping it again
dismisses the image I hope you guys like
this tutorial and try this out we'll
build the rest of the app in the next
tutorial please like and subscribe thank
