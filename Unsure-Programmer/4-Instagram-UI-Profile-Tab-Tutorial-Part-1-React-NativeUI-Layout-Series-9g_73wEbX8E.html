where we left off we had created the
home screen along with the stories
header in Instagram UI app and we add
the tabs created in today's video we'll
build on the profile tab so this is what
it will look like in the end we'll have
a profile tab here and we can also click
on these segments to open up the other
segments of the app just like a normal
Instagram app so let's begin
so in our main screen we had a header
that we had put in but now if we go to
the profile tab we still have the same
header which is not the case in the
actual Instagram app each tab has a
different header so let's get rid of
this navigation options here and put in
header equal to null and let's set up a
header separately for each page so now
that I had I was gone let's come to the
home tab let's import header here and
we'll need left and right as well above
the content over here we'll put in the
header see here we'll just put in left
inside that would put in the icon of
named iOS camera outline we'll put in a
body here with the text
and that will put in a right here which
would be icon named iOS send out line
and we'll also just put in some styles
and let us import body in here as well
so there we see our header is back and
if we go to the profile tab we don't
have a header here so we can set up our
profile tab header as well so let's
start working on a profile tab now we
start by importing the things we need so
we need the container the content the
header left body and right for the
header and a button before we save this
let's make a change here in the
simulator let's disable live reload and
let's enable hot reloading come back to
the profile tab now if we make changes
here and I have this whole app will not
load only the profile tab will load for
us so let's get rid of the view over
here bring a container and we'll just
say style flex of 1 background color of
white and let's start by copying in the
header here from our Home tab
and we save that out we have the header
there we want to change the icons so the
left icon is gonna be MD personnel and
for the right I can't we're gonna have
to import another icon set which need a
base provides us an typos icon from
react native vector icons slash in typo
so let's change this icon to N type icon
and change icon him to back in time and
what it also do is we'll give it a font
size here of 32 once you save that out
we see we've got an icon which looks
similar the archive icon and also here
inside of Instagram I'm just going to
put in my username now for the layout
first we'll put in the content which is
a scroll view which covers the complete
view of the app inside this will put in
a view which will be the top half of our
app which has the users details and it
stands inside this view will put in
another view which has which has a flex
direction of row and inside this let's
put in the image of the user set us a
view for an image of source
I already have the image in masses
folder let's give it a style width of 75
height of 75 and a border radius of half
of that so that becomes round and let's
import image in first here at the top
and now we see we have the image of the
user let's get the image viewer style of
flex of 1 and create another view here
which will have the stats of the user
which will have a flex of 3 so star is
equal to flex 3 now if we have a look at
the Instagram app we want to have this
text to be displayed so what we'd say is
let's just put in the text in first so
you want 20 I'm just going to copy that
and you want to 0 6 along with 167 if we
save that we see that they're coming in
vertically so we want them to be
horizontal so for that we'll put in
another view inside this which will have
a flex direction of row
put the text inside the view so we see
that the Texas become horizontal we want
to justify the content to space around
but then we want this text which is
below this not to be aligned with it
horizontally as of now if we put another
text here which has posts it will also
go to the right so what we do is we'll
wrap this text also inside another view
like this and then we put in a text
below this which will by default remain
horizontal there let's put some style to
this switch a style font size of 10 and
color of gray also to the parent view
will say style the align items of center
so that's aligned the text correctly
let's get rid of these texts here and
let's copy this two times and I just
change these values so that that's
looking quite similar to what we want so
in this view style flex of three we put
in another view here at the bottom
we live in a flex direction of row as
well since we want the buttons to
display side by side now let's put in
the two buttons that we need will give
the partner prop of border and a color
of dark put in a text called edit
profile and there we've got our button
which we need to style so let's put in
some style say style is equal to you
give the button a flex of 3 a margin
left of 10 a justify content of center
and a height of 30 now if we see the
buttons taking up the whole space that's
because we haven't got another view here
so let's put in another button here we
should also be bordered and dark in the
style we give it a flex of 1 since you
want it to be much smaller height will
remain as 30 margin rightful would be of
10 and a margin left of 5 will also
justify the content the center here
let's close the button now
and put in an icon here called settings
so as we can see we've got a edit
profile button which looks quite similar
to this and also our settings button let
us space this out a little bit so here
in our button view let's put a padding
top of 10 let's come to a photograph
here let's put in a line items of centre
and let's add a padding top to the main
view here of 10 next for our top half
what were left with is to put this text
here so let's do that
so inside a main view here which has a
padding of top we put in another view
here inside this I'll just copy the text
in so we have three text views one is
the name then the description and the
website what we'll do is we'll give this
a padding bottom of 10 so that whatever
comes below this is at least spaced out
by 10 and we'd also give it a padding
horizontal of 10 in fact let's make this
padding vertical so there we see we've
got our top half completed he looks very
similar to the Instagram app obviously
you can change the border colors to
match them and the next video I'll show
you how to create this bottom half
along with these clickable segments I
just didn't want the video to get very
long that's why I split it up into two
videos the line you guys can try this up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
