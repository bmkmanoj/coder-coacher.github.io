create the layout with a snapchat app
along with the camera using react native
the camera component we're going to be
using is going to be from Expo as you
can see here in front of us I have my
phone connected if I just raise that up
here you can see that the camera is on
you have all the buttons that look like
the actual snapchat app if you want you
can flip the camera over as well and you
have the forward camera working
if we just come to the app it first
opens up with a camera then if we swipe
left we have the chance screen if we
swipe right we have the story screen and
we swipe down we get the search screen
and going up we have the memory screen
just like the real app in this video
I'll show you how to set this up so
let's begin so to start with as always I
have an empty project created here with
Expo we'll start by installing two
dependencies the first one is going to
be native base as always the UI library
our love so we'll say npm install native
base it gives us some nice components
that makes our lives easier while trying
to make complex you guys and the next
one is going to be called react native
swiper which is gonna help us set up the
swipe navigation app so it's a npm
install react native Swiper
once that's done there are times when
you get this ahead screen just run npm
install to get rid of that it'll make
sure that all the other dependencies
that are required are installed and then
just reload your app and you're good to
go so let's first set up the swipe
navigation let's import some things from
native base so we need the container and
the content from nato base
and let's import the swiper from react
native Swiper let's get rid of this view
here and put in a container the complete
app usually goes inside this container
inside that we'll put in a Content which
is basically a scroll view and then
we'll put in the Swiper inside the
Swiper we'll just put in three views
call the first one chat the second one
will be the camera now the third one
will be stories if we just save and
refresh that so as we can see here we're
getting these three dots here and we're
getting the text here which is at the
top if we swipe the dot changes and the
screen changes to camera and then it
changes to stories so let's stay in the
style of this and bring this into the
center so say Constance styles
is equal to style sheet now create let's
call it slide default even reflects a
one justify content of center line items
of center and a nice blue background
color let's apply these styles to each
of the views
and we also just create a style for the
text so you change the color to white
increase the font size to 30 and give it
a font-weight:bold and we're getting an
error here we can get rid of that error
by removing these duplicate styles at
the bottom we see that that's gone let's
set the styles to the text as well
and there we see it looks a little
better and if you swipe it we can easily
tell that that's the camera screen
stories and we have the chance screen so
right now the app opens up first with
the chat screen in front of us
we want to have the camera screen as the
first screen also if we scroll over the
end it comes back to the first screen
that's the feature we want to remove and
we also want to get rid of these three
dots here at the bottom that we can
easily do by adding some props to the
Swiper first thing you want to do is and
loop equal to false this will make sure
that you cannot swipe over the last
clean and come back to the first screen
to remove the dots we'll sad shows
pagination equal to false and to start
with the camera screen will set the
index equal to one assuming that the
first index is zero one and two we want
to start with the first index let's save
this and try this out as you can see
we're starting with the camera screen
the dots are gone we can scroll back and
we cannot scroll over anymore
now we need to enable a vertical scroll
in our camera screen so that if the user
swipes down we get the search tab and if
he swipes up we get the memory stamp so
what we do is here we'll put in another
Swiper and move the camera screen inside
that Swiper will duplicate the camera
screen to create two more screens name
the first one stories and a third one
memories and we'll add some props to
this Swiper so as always we'll say loop
equal to false shows pagination equal to
false and we'll set horizontal equal to
false as well so that the user can swipe
vertically and again we'll set the index
equal to one as we want the camera
screen to be the first screen so once we
save that out let's see we can swipe
vertically we're carrying the story
screen and we swipe down we get the
memory screen but there's an issue here
if we swipe left on the memory screen we
go to the chat screen or if we're even
on the story screen we swipe left we go
to the chat screen which is not the X
that we want you only want the user to
be able to swipe left or right when he's
on the camera screen so let's fix that
we're gonna use a prop called on index
changed and that's going to call a
method passing in the index let's call
that method vertical scroll and before
we create that method let's change the
stories to search actually because when
the user Scrolls vertically we wanted to
go to the search screen and not stories
now coming out of the top will first set
up a state so it's a constructor we'll
say this dot state is equal to and we
call it outer scroll enabled and set it
by default to true next let's create the
method so it's called what it will
scroll pass in the index and you will
check if the index is not equal equal to
one that is if it's not the camera
screen then set the outer scroll enable
to false this starts at state outer
scroll enable false else editor true
so all we're doing is were telling it to
check if it's the camera screen only
then allow horizontal scrolling but if
it's some other screen do not allow it
to scroll horizontally so as we can see
when we come to the search screen we
can't scroll horizontally and when we
come to the memory screen we can't
scroll horizontally either it only works
on the camera screen so the basic UI of
the snapchat app is complete in the next
video we'll start by setting up the
camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
