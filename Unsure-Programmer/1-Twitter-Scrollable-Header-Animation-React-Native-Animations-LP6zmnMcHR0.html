called the react native animation series
this is the first video in that series
in this video I'll show you how to
create this crawlable header which is
then the Twitter app so in the app when
the user Scrolls up the profile picture
and the header reduce in size then the
picture gets hidden behind the header
and when the text comes up to the header
it starts appearing in the header and
white color so let's begin so it's not
with an empty react native project we
start by creating a few constants first
the first one is going to be called
header max height get a max out of 120
header minimum height of 70 a profile
image max height of 80 and a profile
image min height of 40 these values will
be useful to us when we're trying to
animate the image and the header now
let's come to the view here let's get
rid of the view create a new empty view
I'll add all the styles in line so that
they easy to understand so start by
giving a flex of 1 next we want to have
a header here so we'll absolutely
position the header on the top here so
let's create another view let's give it
some styles first one is gonna be
position which is going to be absolute
they will say top:0 left:0 and right of
0 give it a background color of light
blue let's call it light sky-blue and
let's give it a height of header max I'd
receive that we get the header in front
of us next let's import our scroll view
into our app so here at the top let's
say scroll view and let's put the scroll
view below the header give it a flex of
1 and inside the scroll we will put
another view it will have a profile
picture so that lets important image
over here as well inside the view let's
put in the image and you can use any
image that you want I'll use one for my
assets folder so if you save that we're
getting a very big image but we want a
small rounded image so let's put this
image into another view and let's give
some styles to this view so the height
of the image we want is the profile
image max height that we had set and the
width also should be profile image max
ID since we want it to be rounded give
it a border radius of half of the
profile image max sight a border color
of white and a border width of 3 let's
also set overflow equal to hidden so
that the image is nicely inside the
circle and he didn't should be in quotes
now we need to make the image expand
into that view so what we say is star is
equal to flex of 1 and let's set the
width and height to null
you
this trick will make sure that the image
fits incorrectly
and there we can see we've got our image
so let's first get the image to the
right place where you want it to be for
that what we do is we'll give this view
a margin drop which will be equal to the
height of the header minus half the
height of the image so that it fits in
perfectly in the middle over here this
will say header max height minus profile
max height divided by two put this into
brackets here and if we save that we can
see that the image is coming in
perfectly we'll also put on a margin
left over here of 10 and let's also just
put in the text below it so let's put in
another view here and put in a text
inside that which has my name in it and
we just add some styles to the text give
it a font weight of bold font size of 26
and a padding left of 10 as well so now
that we have the layout ready in the
next video I'll show you how to animate
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
