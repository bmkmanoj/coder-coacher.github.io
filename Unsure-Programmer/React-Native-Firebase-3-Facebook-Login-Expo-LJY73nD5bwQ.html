add an email authentication system into
a react native and firebase application
in this video I'll show you how to add a
facebook login button into your
application and link it with your
firebase database so let's begin the
first thing we'll do is we'll open up
the developers console of Facebook in
our browser set developers dot
facebook.com and create a new app let's
call that at react firebase unser down
to the security check the app should be
created once we're on our dashboard go
into settings and click on add platform
select iOS and in the bundle ID add host
dot X exp dot exponent and save the
changes next add Android and in the key
hashes we have to just copy a key hash
which is given on the export
documentation website and paste it here
here on the Facebook documentation in
the x-bow website here we have the
bundle ID for the iOS device and we have
the Android hash key for the Android
device and save the changes next we need
to go into a firebase console and enable
Facebook log in there we need two things
that from Facebook that is the app ID in
the app secret key so let's go to the
dashboard here copy this app ID here and
show this and copy the app secret key as
well come to a firebase console sign in
method and enable Facebook sign in here
paste in the app ID and the app secret
key I'll just paste in the absolute key
here and then compactive so a Faceman
save the app secret key and the app ID
that's all we need to do here at five s
let's come back to our app let's create
a button for Facebook log in here so
what I'll do is I'll just copy this
button down here and I'll just change
the text to log in with Facebook let's
clear this unpress method for now we'll
create our own method so coming here to
the top we will create an async function
called login with Facebook create a
constant type in token we run a weight
export Facebook dot in with read
permissions async pass in the app idea
and then with select permissions that we
want so we'll say permissions public
profile next we'll check if type is
equal equal to success then we build
fire by schedules with the Facebook
access token that we receive with say
constant credential is equal to 5 days
toward Earth dot Facebook Earth provider
dot credential and pass in the token
there then we run firebase toward Earth
and sign the user in with those four
have these credentials
and then the idle dot can share which
will just catch the error will the sake
console dot log error next we'll add
this method here in the button so it
said they start login with Facebook
whenever a user clicks the log in with
Facebook but also what this does here is
it locks the user into the firebase
console and also log the user into
Facebook but what we need to do is we
need to check when this happens so that
we can retrieve the details of the user
so that will do here in another method
here we create a component did mount and
inside this will create a listener which
is fire based on Earth dot on change
listener
and we'll check if the user is not equal
to null this console dot log the user
so basically when the users logged in
this method will run and get the users
data whenever the state of the user
changes see if that I had a typo here
there should be public profile and here
there should be a sync
I missed the C and here there should be
a capital I sorry for the multiple typos
so once you test this out we see that
facebook login is opening up and here we
just enter our email and password and
click on login opening up the expo
client here click on continue first and
here the expo client as we can see that
the on state changed method has detected
a change in the user's login and we've
caught the users data back we have the
API key we have the display name of the
user and we have the users for F now we
can use this data and store this into a
firebase database and carry out other
actions on the particular user that's
also just confirmed that the user has
been signed in into a console by
checking a firebase console C in a
console let's go into authentication and
there we can see that the user has been
created and signed in using our facebook
login there was a simple tutorial on how
to add a login with Facebook to your app
