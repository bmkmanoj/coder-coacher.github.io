at the point where we could see what all
other users that are registered on our
application now in this next part we're
going to do two things the first thing
is we're going to see if the user is
online or offline and display that in
this on this page we're going to do that
by basically storing the ID of all the
devices the user logs in from and then
display if the user is online or offline
by either showing a green circle around
the user or a red circle around the user
secondly we'll enable private chats so
that you can chat with an individual
user so that's a big in first thing that
we do is go into the home view
controller and start by storing the
device ID of the user into a variable so
let's start with this led to Vice ID
equal to uij device your current device
not identifier for vendor dot new IDs
string store the device ID secondly
we're going to set up a function which
we are going to call let's call it
manage connections and we're going to
pass in a user ID of the user which is
going to be a string inside this we need
a reference to our database where we
will store the status of the user
whether the user is online or offline so
create a reference to the database we're
going to do that by saying let my
connections let's let's call this my
connections ref is equal to fi our
database for that we are going to have
to import firebase database
if our database dot Tita base not
reference with path and the path we're
going to give it is User Profile pass in
the user ID that we're going to pass for
the function and inside that we go we'll
put in create a node called connections
and inside that we'll put it under the
device ID because you use it in the
online for multiple devices and we only
want to log the user out from the
specific device the user logs out from
so we have that here next what we'll do
is is it could my connection raft or
child and we call the node inside this
online and when the user logs in we'll
set its value to true so when the user
logs in set the value to true what we'll
also do is we'll also set our timestamp
which will show the last time the user
logged in so we'll call that last on
line the set value and inside that we
will do put in our NS date dot time
interval since 1970 and we will now
create a observer which will monitor if
the user is logged in or logged out
let's call them my connections ref dot
observe so my connections are F dot
observe event type it's going to be if
any value is changed
so we'll say dot value and with block
suppose the data is returned we call it
snapshot in and we're going to use new
function here
we called God and will say God let
connected equal to snapshot God value as
a boolean we're connected else run this
block so we don't want to return
anything if the user if nothing is
returned so basically what the guard
statement does is is unlike an if
statement and God statements only run if
the conditions are not met so it's
basically we're trying to catch the
negative result instead of the positive
results so if we know that a boolean is
returned then it's okay
update the page if it's not returned
then don't
we've got no update then don't return
anything so statements only run if the
conditions are not met okay now we've
set this up you to understand this more
clearly once we actually call it so
let's see what gonna do the one thing
which is need to correct over here is is
not reconnection
this is gonna be connections so just
correcting that now if we come back up
in the viewdidload method this is where
we're going to call the manage functions
correction manage connections function
so once we've got the user logged in
we've got these details here we call
manage connections with the UID of the
user
so let's run run this now and you'll see
what happens so running this and we'll
open up our firebase console
so as you see this connections tab is
updated and it's showing last on line at
this time and on line equal to true but
right now the user logs out nothing gets
updated over here it just still shows
that the user is online so let us try
and log back in again and see last on
line got updated but online remained it
true
so let's manage the logout now so if you
come into the dip tap log out but
function what we do over here is first
we need to store the user here as well
so let's say let you say equal to fi
auth dot off because we need the hue ID
of the user not current user and then
say let my connections ref again let's
create a reference if our database dot
database or reference with path and this
is again going to be user profile and
this is going to be user dot UID left
for some record connections
and what we'll do here is called my
connections are F dot child and we call
will update the online node to a value
of false and will also update the last
online to the time when I use the last
logged out
so now we have that let's try them on
this again
so we saw that oh yeah we have to keep
in mind one thing that because we're
using the simulator the simulator
creates a new device ID every time but
this will not happen when we're actually
using a real device so let's just delete
the earlier one delete that out this is
the new one that we have it showing
online is true
let's lock this out so as of now we can
update our database with the user status
whether he's online or offline but you
see in the actual app we don't see any
change this may go to the user's
collection view controller it just shows
the users that it does not indicate
which users online of each other's
offline so let's do that now so let's go
into a user's collection view controller
and earlier last time what we've done is
we had created separate arrays for the
users names for the users images we're
going to change that now and we just
create one object which is going to
store the names images and the online
status together just to make it easier
or display so let's create a new array
which is going to be called users added
and let's call it an area of any object
and just initialize that we'll also
create another object which will store
the current logged in user so let's call
that logged in user and it'll be of type
any object so now inside the viewdidload
method let's store the current user self
dot logged in user is equal to if I are
off for that with after a import
firebase of firework dot earth load
current user
and now what we'll have to do is we come
inside this four loop that we had
created we were going through the
details of each user because the issue
says under a specific user ID so we were
going for user ID comma details insert
road users date what we'll do is we'll
create another for loop which will be
called for device ID comma connection in
corrections and for that what we'll have
to do is we'll have to store the
connections first from the rate data
that we get which is going to be details
dot object for key connections as
nsdictionary
runner if condition and we'll see if
connection dot object for key online
ensure that it is false downcast as a
bull if it is true then what we'll do is
we'll set a key on the details object
set value true for key online so the
users online add another value in the
details else what we do is if details
dot object for key online not equal to
true P equal to true set the value to
false
the reason why we're doing another if
check inside the else block is that
because with the users allowed to log in
from multiple devices if the user on the
first devices logged in it will change
this to true but if in the second device
it is not logged in if you don't have
this F block it will set it to false
which will be wrong actually because
users online on one device and offline
on the other so we check that if this
object key is already set as true then
don't change it to false only if the
earlier devices were also offline then
said this device also drove they said
this key to offline next what we do is
we'll make sure that the user has been
shut currently is not the currently
logged in user
only then add this user to the details
block first we store the UID of the
users for reference and then we say self
dot users add a dot append details
because if you remember in our app we
can see ourselves online as well which
is pointless we don't want to see
ourselves we only want to see the other
users so this is what this block does it
checks if the current user that is being
seen in this four block is the logged in
user then don't add it only if it is not
the current user set this current users
UID in the details block and then append
the user to the users array now what we
what we need to do is we don't need this
one users images idea we don't need user
names array similarly over here we don't
need user names at it or you save it as
array and if you remember that we had
done the number of items was from the
user images array which we're going to
change we're gonna make this return
self-taught users array not count
because now using only one object and
also we're gonna have to update the
salford item at index path so what we're
gonna do here is we're going to change
this and it's gonna be let image URL
equal to let's first comment this out
and say let image URL equal to NS URL
will be type string self dot users array
index path dot row profile take small
and force downcast that is a string next
we we have to do let image data equal to
NS data contents of URL and paren image
URL so I can see this is much better
you have the complete users details in
our details in our self-taught users
array and we can just extract the
information we need even out for some
practice and now in the cell dot user
image dot image set this new UI image if
you remember if you go to the collection
your cell uses image and represent
user's name now is that now is the part
that shows which user is online offline
by putting either a green circle around
the user or a red circle around the user
so add a border to the images so that we
do a cell dot user image dot layer dot
border width is equal to let's give it
with the 1.5 and we'll check if
self-taught users array index path dot
row the online key it as book downcast
as a bull if it is true that means the
user is online we set the size cell door
user image dot layer dot border color
equal to UI color dot green color dot CG
color else cell not use a image border
color is equal to UI color dot red
colored or CG color so if you remember
here here is why we checked if the
connection of the user is online the
same thing we're checking here if that
user is online set its border color to
green L set its border color to yet we
also need to set the text the name of
the user so we don't want the full name
of the user you only want the first name
so get the first name and what we do is
let
first name equal to self-taught users
array index part not grow Toro get the
name you might want to make sure it's a
string for some data and separated by a
space using component separated by
string this gets tough so we've got the
first name now update the name it is
cell door user name dot dot text equal
to first-name also just gonna make a
slight change in our main storyboard if
we come here select the label and
stretch it out fully so that the full
name is displayed as of now we can see
that the name gets cut out so put
stretch that fully aligned it to the
center and update the constraints by
clicking on this object constraints
now before you test this out you wanna
make sure that you log your users out
and lock them back in so that they all
get a connections tab in the database so
once you've done that we can test this
out
so there you can see we've got two other
users one of them is online one of them
is offline let's confirm that if we come
here and we see this user is online on
one device and offline on the other
device we put this to false as well will
she get updated here it did get updated
but as you can see that the users got
duplicated let's correct that what we
need to just do it we need to just reset
the self dot users array every time the
data loads so that we have an empty
array so let's do that once we receive
the users data let's reset this array to
an empty array now if you done this we
should see see it getting updated
currently both users are offline if we
change this users status to online on
any device we see it getting updated
here similarly for the other user here
on any device we set this to true which
is see it get updated there is so now
that we know we choose as online or
chooses offline the last part that's
remaining of this tutorial is to enable
private chats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
