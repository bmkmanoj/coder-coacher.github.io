come to the search time navigator
we'll start by importing the time
navigator from the AG navigation we'll
get rid of the class here and we create
a time navigator first time will be the
search time the screen for that will be
the search tab the second will be the
favorites tab and the screen for that
will also be called the favorites tab
let's import these two tabs in fact
let's create these two tabs first so
that means to search folder let's create
a new folder call the tab navigator
inside the time navigator we create two
files search time door chairs and
favorite stamp dot Cheers let's import
these two files into a system navigator
there should be call search tab over
here and let's customize the tab
navigator right now so firstly here what
we'll say is stamp opposition will say
bottom and the next property will be the
tab bar components which allows us to
customize the tab navigator
here we can return the
some components of the EM navigator so
this will import some components from
native base so we'll import footer
footer tab and button from little base
here in the return we have the footer
which is a parent element inside that we
have the footer tab and inside that we
have the buttons so I have just created
the two buttons inside the button we
will create a property called vertical
this ensures that that text comes below
the icon in the tab navigator and will
add an icon call that beer and text and
call us search the second button again
will set the property to vertical icon
name equal to star for our favorites and
texts equal to favorites let's refresh
this here and obviously right now our
source tab now favorite stamps are empty
that's why we're getting this arrow so
let's just add some boilerplate code
here like we did earlier we'll just call
this search term
let's not return anything and here let's
call this favorites tab and this return
our text fields and as you can see over
here we forgot import-export the
stagnant search time navigator there you
can see the app is opening up if you
click on search pairs or we have another
error here which is because in the
Search tab navigator we forgot the
import icon
so let's import that from native base
at that refresh click on search pairs
there it takes us to the tab navigator
where we have the search tab in the
favorites tab right now if you click on
these tabs we see that nothing happens
so that we just need to add two lines of
code here firstly will be active is
equal to prop start navigation state dot
index equal to zero and we'll add an on
press on this to the search tab we'll
just copy this add it to this button and
we'd make the index one and here we'll
make this the favorites turn the index
with this to be active is zero and the
index with this to be active is 1 and
when we click on this it takes us to the
Search tab and we click on this it takes
us to the favorites tab there we see the
Search tab is active click on the
favorites tab the favorites tab is
active and we see the text in front of
us I just realized because zoom it to
make it look a little better
so let's come to the Search tab now here
firstly let's get rid of the header we
don't need that here as well with a
static navigation options and we'll say
header is null next let's import some
components from native base
so we imported the container and content
from native base and here we put in a
container inside which will have a
content here about the content we'll
import or search-header which will
create in a separate file so let's
create that file inside the search
folder let's create the file called
search header and let's import some
boilerplate code so now we have a search
header before we build on the search
header let's do one thing come to the
after dress and here are the initial
draft currently is the home screen which
is usually the first screen in the stack
navigate let's change the initial route
to the Search tab navigator while by
working on it
so that is it's easier for us to test
out the changes so that's the initial
now name let's call that search term
navigator so you save that out
automatically we open up the search time
navigator
coming back to the search term to the
search header sorry
on top it imports some components from
native base header icon item in input
get out of the view here put in a header
the header should be of type search bar
and the edges should be rounded inside
this let's put in an item will have an
icon of name is search
the input and we need to also set the
height of the header for it to be
visible so we'll just add an inline
style
it says height of 80 and let's import
the search header into the search time
import search header search-header let's
put that in here now we see we've got
the search header on top so here in the
search tab let's add a logic to make the
search here let's create state and let's
call the first one search beer another
one called beer data in the search
header we'll pass in some props the
first will be the value which will be
equal to they start state third search
beer the second will be unchanged text
it will take the data that's entered and
update the state let's save this come to
the search-header inside the input for a
placeholder just enter beyond in set the
return key type the search put in the on
change text method which will call the
unchanged tags of the parent using the
props because it shouldn't be changing
the state inside a child component so
right now we have a placeholder we have
if we enter anything inside over here it
will update the state which is the state
over here of search pair we have
reported a method and also yeah and also
when we click on this field here it
brings up a button here which has
searched instead of okay
which is what we got from putting in the
return key type next we need to enable
the search so here let's put in a method
here which is going to be called on
submit editing this is a drop of the
input type and this will call a method
in the parents which in the parent which
is going to be called this dot prop
store be our search so we'll set that
here be our search when Bo searches call
is called when Bo search is called we'll
call the beer search method which will
create so we'll create this method here
will just say search for beer slash test
this out let us enter any beer name here
and we click on search it says alerts
search for beer so just to clarify this
we have a search header which is a
custom component created by house we
have certain prompts that were passing
down to our input field
the first one is value on trains tags
and then their search the input field
has a non change text method by default
when it detects a change in the text it
calls the on change text method of the
parent which is here which in turn runs
this function to update the state
similarly when we click on search here
on the keyboard on submit editing is
called which is a default method of the
input field which in turn calls this dot
prop start their search their search is
mentioned here as a prop which in turn
points to the beer search method clear
created here the repetition of the names
might be causing some confusion so I
thought our clarified so now let's
create the beer search method first
that's important other component from
the AK native it's called keyboard
moment the user clicks on search we
first want to hide the keyboard so we'd
say keyboard dot dismiss
next we create a constant called be on
in and we'll convert the enter text into
lowercase next we need to make the get
request to the brewery levy database so
let's see how we're going to set that up
here on the brewery da DB website you
ever create in your account here once
you clear it in your account you can go
to developers here click on start
developing now and register new app so I
have name is called fine beer find the
latest and greatest beers we leave the
website empty and platform we'll just
call it is for now and we register it so
there we get an API key which we can use
from the API documentation we can find
out how to search beers so the base URL
that we need is this here API or Florida
tv.com /v - slash the key should be
passed along with this we need to look
for the endpoint for searching the Bears
come in to search over here and if you
come to the example over here what we
need is search we need a query type
which is mandatory it shouldn't be the
name of the beer and we need the type
which is pure in our case so I already
copied the query that we need so query
turns out to be this part which is
mandatory it'll be to that after we want
to search you want a query type of the
beer name that the user entered and the
type has to be beer and along with that
we've entered the key next let's use
Axios to search for the beer so it's a
Axios not get pass in the query dot then
you get the response and then we work on
the response so let us consult or log
the response
and I will show you what it is if you
search for Corona and we forgot to
import Axios so here we say import X Y
from X Y and then let's try that again
so there you see we get a lot of data
back but we need to filter out the data
that we need so if you come here you get
an object which has the configuration of
the requests that's received what we
need is we need to go into the data so
firstly you go one level lower inside
that again we need to go into the data
where we can access this array of object
so we would go inside two levels of the
returned object from there we can get
the details of the pair so what we need
to do is we need to get the data by
saying this pawn store data dot data go
into the first element of the array and
see if that exists if that exists then
you return that else the user enter the
beer that is not found and then let's
console dot log the data
so there we see we've got the data of
the beer he's giving us everything the
description the name the name display
the status we're only worried about a
certain things that we want to show
depending on what you want for your amp
you can show the rest of the data as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
