native project that you created with
Expo it's time to make it available to
the rest of the world in this video I'll
show you exactly how to do that so
you're in front of me I have Expo open
up you have three options
the first option is running the app from
your local machine if you just click
Share here this application is available
for anyone to scan from their expo app
or you can send them a link for them to
open it in their phones
however this app is only going to be
available till the time your computer is
open the moment you switch off your
computer this app is closed so the
second option you have is click the
publish button here this will make your
experience publicly accessible just
click on yes expo will run a server and
react native on your local machine to
bundle up your code and make it
available at a remote URL which will be
available to us once this process is
complete your project is now uploaded
and this link is available to us it's
important to note that Expo is also
minified all your code and generated two
versions one for Android and one for us
it also uploads all your app images
fonts and videos to a content delivery
network from where it is available
remotely let's click on this link and
check it out so there we have it
my react news app is available to
everyone around the world the user just
needs to use his expo app to scan this
barcode or go to this particular link
and nikka this app is available to
download so we've covered two ways of
uploading an x-y app however both these
wheels require the user to have the
explication installed on their phones to
access the app in a real-world situation
that's not how we want our app to be
accessed what we want is we want to
upload the respective binaries of our
app to the Apple Store and the Google
Play Store the cool thing about Expo is
that when we build the Pinery the
current version of our app javascript is
bundled so that reloads immediately the
first time the app opens however we are
not going to be tied to that javascript
version of the app
once we update our app and we push it
again to the server our apps should be
able to get updated over-the-air without
the user having to download the app
again from the App Store or click on
update the way this works in Android and
iOS is slightly different on Android
when the user opens up the app and finds
a new version first the old version is
going to be short to the user while the
new version gets downloaded in the
background in iOS this happens
synchronously and the moment new version
is downloaded it is displayed to the
user so Apple does not allow us to even
build our binary without having a
developer account Google allows us to
build our binary without having a
developer account but when we have to
publish our app to the App Store's we do
need to have our individual developer
accounts activated to get your iOS
developer cart go to developer.apple.com
and sign in with your Apple ID
it's about $99 per year for the
developer account whereas in case of
Google you have to plate or google.com
and sign up for your developer account
there it's about 25 dollars a year so
once we have the account set up when you
start building the binaries for us and
Android the expo app as of now does not
allow us to build the binary from the
GUI interface for that we need to
install exp so let's open up item and
run NPM install G exp exp is the command
line tool for expo before we start
building our binary let's just have a
look at the app dot JSON of our app this
is where we make the configuration
changes of our application so here the
name icon and the version number are
mandatory the slug here is basically the
URL name that your app's javascript is
published to so in our case the link is
the one here and as we can see the last
part of it react news is our slug the
SDK version is the version of Expo used
to create the application and the bundle
identifier czar basically reverse DNS
names they don't actually need to point
to your websites but can just be to
replace for anything that makes sense of
foreign to you the expo website has a
complete list of all the configurations
available
and their explanations you can head to
the website to have a look now head to
your project folder and boot up the expo
package manager / typing exp start in my
case the client is already running as I
had started earlier next I'll start by
building for Android so let's run exp
build : Android
so in my case since I already build my
Android project earlier it did not ask
for any configuration settings but if we
had to the export documentation it says
here if you choose to build for Android
it'll ask you would you like to upload a
kisko or have one generated for you so
let Expo handle the process for you and
it will upload all the keys required
accordingly and that's actually all that
we need to do to build a Android project
we can head to this website here to have
a look at the status of our project and
there you can see that is showing you
the pull logs and indicating that the
project is currently building once this
is completed all we need to do is click
on download and we'll have a apk file
ready for us so there you can see it
took us about nine minutes for the app
to get completed and the download link
is now available so toward this video
from getting too long what I'll do is in
the next video I'll show you how to
build your iOS project and then upload
both your Android and your iOS projects
in the app store till then you guys can
try this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
