content view of an Amazon app with this
recommendation section in this last part
I'll show you how to set up the draw
navigator and we also customize the draw
navigator to look the way we wanted to
so the first thing we do is we set up
this button to open up the draw
navigator
so inside our home screen where we have
this icon MD menu let's put in an on
press and we call a method which is
provided to us by react navigation which
is this dot prop store navigation or
navigate drawer open once you got that
setup if we click this button here we
see our drawers opening up
now let's style the drawer for that come
to the apt or yes and here we just
import certain things from native base
so you have copied them in we need the
icon container content header left body
right list and list item from native
base now to customize the draw navigator
we need to basically create a custom
component so let's do that
we'll say Const custom draw content
component we pass in the props and here
we can just create a normal view which
would replace our draw navigator so
inside this let's pass in our container
and inside that we'll put in a header
you want to style the header to have the
same background color as the header of
the app and the same height so it's a
style is equal to background color and
put in that nice blue color and it's a
height of 90 right now we can't see it
because you've not passed it in so let's
do that in our draw navigator we'll have
to pass in some properties so here let's
put in the properties the first thing
which is not required to reduce put it
is the drop position which by default is
left then we need a Content component
which is going to be our custom draw
content component next we need three
methods that are mandatory
the first one is drawer open route which
points the drawer open method
the drawer closed round which points the
drawer closed and the drawer toggle
route which points the draw trouble once
we have these set up we can test this
out and there we can see we're getting
our nice header now let's add a Content
view inside our container here below our
header so let's say content and inside
this we create three different list
views to have our particular items here
for that I'll just important flat list
from the AK native preferably we could
create one list but just for this video
I'll create three lists so inside the
content view it put in flat list let's
close that out inside that the first
thing we need is data so first item is
gonna be home then shop by category and
then today's deals now we just render
the item which is equal to curly
brackets followed by circle brackets
inside that will have a item in curly
brackets again just make sure you get
this syntax right inside this will pass
in a list item which will have a text
inside it so we say text and that will
be the name of the item
obviously this list item can have a non
press which will take us to the
particular screen for now I haven't put
that in so if you open that up we're
getting our three items here and what
we'll do is we'll just get rid of the
borders by saying no border and their
borders are gone you can just district
out this arrow for now it's just telling
us that each item must have a specific
key so you can just put in a key here
for each item we just copy this flat
list and we've got three flat lists now
I'll quickly just change up the values
so that I've just added the list items
what we'll do is we'll also give a nice
border to the bottom two flat lists see
here let's put in a style and say border
top width of 0.5 and a border top color
of a nice gray there we have it and
we'll just copy this on our bottom flat
list
now if you just refresh this and have a
look here we'll just zoom that in and as
you can see we've got our three lists
with that nice border all were left with
is the header here so let's put in the
text there so inside the header what we
do is we'll put in a left which has a
style of flex of one inside that let's
put in an icon of named person and style
it to have a color of white let's close
that out they were getting the icon I'll
do the Android fix also after this then
we'll just put in a text here which will
be the name of the person so give me
hello viral and they were getting the
text but we're not getting in the place
we want it to be so let's style the text
so the style is equal to margin left of
five font size of 20 to color of white
and a font style of italic there and
let's put in flex direction of drew here
so that they come side by side and we'll
also align the items Center for Android
we'll just copy in this fix that we have
which is Android header coming here at
the bottom inside our Styles let's put
in Android header let's import in
platform from react native and status
bar and let's just add that to our
header here so put that into an array
and let's say style Store Android header
that shouldn't affect our iOS design so
this completes our styling of our draw
navigator I hope you guys try this out
I'll share the code of this on my github
