a nice animation that we have seen in a
lot of apps one of the popular apps is
called news and shorts it's a news app
in India in which you can just swipe the
screen up to go into the next article so
as you can see how you're swiping and
you are getting to see the next article
so let's begin so in front of me I have
an empty project I've created with Expo
I've called our class deck swiper we're
going to start by just reading the
layout of what we want so you want a
view which has two parts in it which is
the first is going to be the image view
and the bottom is going to be the
article view for that as you can notice
here I've got some images here in my
assets folder I'm just going to paste
them in here we use the map function to
map over these images and display the
article with some texture so to begin
with let's get rid of the view and write
put in an empty view here let's give
that view a flex of 1 and inside that
we'll call a method called render
articles let's create this method here
now
so inside this will map over the
articles will say articles dot map get
the first item get the index and
obviously we must return this map and
inside that will return a main view
which houses both the image and the
article so let's give that a flex of one
again and inside that will have a top
view which say has a flex of two in
another view which has a flex of three
it's a slightly bigger than the top view
and here also we're calling a function
so this should be a fat arrow here here
let's put in some boilerplate text here
so put in a text and inside that under
scorpions in text and as you can see
we're getting the text about five times
which is not exactly what we want but at
least we're getting the text there what
were missing is some styling so let's do
that so here to the main view let's put
on a command here I'll put the Styles in
line so that they easier to understand
let's give it a position of absolute
because we want these to stack over each
other so the only way of doing that is
putting the strap salute give it a
height which will be the screen height
so we still have to get this and a width
which will be the width of the screen
and also let us give a background color
of white for uniformity so how will we
get the height in the width will come
here let's import something known as
dimensions from react native to signal
that I do for now so let's hit a
constant called screen height and get
the dimensions dot cat window dot height
similarly let's get the widths will be
constant screen width is equal to
dimensions dot cat window dot width now
let's put these two in here so it's a
high it is going to be screen height
width is going to be screen widths
let's see if there are and I've spelled
absolute wrong so let's make that
absolute that seems just about right and
now you can see that we can only see one
set of texture and we're getting this
other arrow over here which says each
child in an area right Reiter should
have a unique key so let us put him a
key her as well let's say ki is equal to
item dot ID so that ki is coming from
here now let's put in the image here at
the top so in the first flex which has a
flex of two we'll put in an image and
obviously let's start by importing the
image here at the top first so we have
the image there in the image we'll put
in the source which will be articles go
into the index which is I and then get
the URI from there
let's style the image so this style is
equal to a flex of 1 because we want to
take up the whole place and for that we
have to give a height of null and a
width of null with a resize mode of
center so that the image gets centered
and as we can see we're getting the
image there on the top what we want to
do is we want to give the background
color of the view of the image a color
of black and that looks much better
and also let's give the text slide
panning that looks much better
and let's duplicate this text here as
well because for Android users the pan
responder doesn't tend to work if
there's empty place here so let us put
in more text here and that's our
complete article now we need to attach
the pan responder so that when we swipe
up we can see the card below it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
