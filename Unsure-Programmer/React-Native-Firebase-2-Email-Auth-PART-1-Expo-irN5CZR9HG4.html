firebase to our react native application
in this video we learn how to create an
email and password login system with
firebase and react native first thing
we'll do is install native base into our
application
it's a UI library which makes it easier
for us to create our form so let's go
ahead make sure your project folder and
type NPM install native base now that we
have the library installed let's create
the layout come to our project and we
need to import a few things from native
base so that we imported container
content header form input item button
label from native base you will see how
each of these works when we create the
layout so let's get rid of the view from
here and instead let's put in a
container inside the container we'll put
in a form inside the form we'll put in
an item the item will have a label
inside it but really called email
and also an input field and the input
will have two properties one is
autocorrect equal to false and auto
capital de is equal to none these are
default props provided by NATO base to
us let us save this as we can see our
email field has gone up in it's out of
the screen so let's do one thing here
let's put a style to the container
we call it style start container this is
already created was out for us over here
what we need to do is we just need to
get rid of a line item center so there
we have the email field over here one
more thing we have to do here is let us
put in floating label as a prop to the
item what that will do is will give us a
nice animation so we Tabitha we see the
email freak goes up similarly let's
create a password field so let's copy
that paste it in here change this
password and one more properly coming
here which is secure text entry we set
that to true so that the password is not
displayed next we'll just put in a
button here to submit our login so you
call the button text login and I will
give it some properties one is full
rounded and success to give it the color
let's save this out and then we can see
we have a login button let's just make
some slight changes to this I'll just
give a style here it says margin top 10
and let's give up adding to the
container so that just looks a little
better so that we have a login layout
ready the next video
we'll connect this login layer to a
firebase database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
