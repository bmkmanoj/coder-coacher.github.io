create a clone of Twitter on iOS using
Swift on the front end and firebase as
the back end in this first part of the
series we'll do three things will allow
the user to sign up using the email and
password then we allow the user to login
using that email and password and lastly
will allow the user to select a unique
username on our Twitter handle for
tweeting we keep the layout simple and
try and make it work like a real-world
application let me start by showing you
what we'll have at the end of the first
tutorial we have the welcome screen in
front of us we'll start by clicking on
the sign up button it brings up a screen
where it asks the user to enter the
email and password and you just click
sign up it registers you successfully
and then it takes you to a page where it
asks you for name and a unique user name
let's put on our name and the username
and then just click start tweeting and
then you already signed up and it takes
you to your home screen where it's going
to allow you to start tweeting this is
where we will continue in the next
tutorial we can also just go into a
firebase console and confirm that the
login has been made come in to firebase
console you can see the users logged in
using email authentication if you go
into a database we will see a handles
node which stores all the handles and a
user profile load which throws the email
address the handle and the name so now
let's begin creating this so let's start
by creating a new project open Xcode and
create a new project single View
application let's call it Twitter clone
and save it
okay first things first we need to first
install the firebase dependencies so
let's go open Safari and go to a
firebase console and create a new
project let's call this Twitter clone as
well once that is created
we'll add five ways to iOS app get your
bundle ID paste it in here add app this
download the Google surface info dot
plist file which we need to copy into
our project so let's go ahead and do
that copy that open up your project and
paste it in there copy items if needed
and finish clicking on continue now what
we need to do is we need to create the
pod file open item go into your project
folder and pod in it and open up your
pod file and install the dependencies
we'll install five eighths we'll also
install firebase auth and firebase
database it's also installed pod storage
which we might need in future
and pod install please close any current
Xcode sessions and use Twitter clone dot
XC workspace for this project from now
on so let's go ahead and do that open up
a Finder and let's first close this
project out open up our finder and let's
open XC workspace now that we have this
open let's open our app delegate first
thing we'll do is import firebase and
configure the app now we're good to go
let's open up the main storyboard as
always let's set the size to five four
decimal seven for ease of working and
let's start setting this up start by
dragging a uiimageview
to the center let's set it size to 60 by
60 put into the center and add the
constraints also let's Center it
vertically and horizontally let's change
this the logo of Twitter I'll put the
link in from where I got this logo and
let us add a nice welcome message
you
welcome to Twitter vertically space it
and centered horizontally also let us
add a small description give us a text
view and let's say que real-time updates
about what matters to you align that to
the center and again vertically spaced
it and horizontal centered horizontally
now let's add the sign up and login
buttons
again vertically spaced that and
centered horizontally and the same thing
with the login button
there we have a welcome screen now let's
create a new storyboard drag in a view
controller paste that in satisfies to
four decimal seven on top we'll add a
navigation bar
let's add the constraints for them and
let's also add a hard constraint and
let's fix the errors that we're getting
okay there we have the navigation bar
we're gonna just change it up a little
bit so that it's white and we'll remove
the title put another button on top
which will allow us to go back from this
screen to the previous screen and let's
call that cancel we have that set up and
at the bottom let's add a toolbar same
thing with that add the constraints set
the height and bottom right and left
margins and fixed miss placement again
we're going to set the background tint
to white remove this item and I had to
add a flexible spacing and then add the
button it to the right
let's call that silent similarly let's
set up a login view controller as well
same thing on the top we'll add a
navigation bar
you
and start by adding email and password
text fields will just add a label on top
says hi there give it a vertical spacing
and the leading space to contain imagine
fixed miss placement copy in a text
field give it a vertical spacing leading
and trailing and let's fix the Miss
placements let's also set its height
let's duplicate this by pressing command
D vertical spacing and we're gonna say
lightly reading trailing equal widths
and equal Heights add a placeholder call
it email call this password I just fix
the Miss placement and what I'll do is
I'm gonna duplicate these into our login
view controller I'll just fast forward
it so that you want to go through it now
that that's not done let us set up the
keyboard type also for these we don't
want any correction to be made we don't
need spell checking and we want the
keyboard type to be email and the
password feel the same thing we don't
want me correction no spell checking and
we want it to be of type secure entry
same thing here
now let's link up our welcome screen to
a sign up and log in controllers control
track on the sign up button and control
drag the login button now let's create
the two files that we need the sign up
view controller and the login view
controller click on file new file and
let's call a cocoa touch class that's
called the sign up and let's create the
other file as well
login new control open up the assistant
editor click on the sign up people view
storyboard and put in sign up view
controller and the log in storyboard and
for in the log in new controller so come
to the sign up view controller let's
start by importing Fiveways database and
firebase auth let's create the outlets
that we need first let's call this one
email and password
let's drag the signup button and go that
sign up let's also create a button for
did tap sign up and let's call an an
action let's also track the cancel
button in and call it date tap cancel
and connect that will start with a dead
tap cancel button the moment the user
clicks the cancel button he should be
taken back to the welcome screen for
that all we need to do is we need to
dismiss view controller set animated
true and we don't want any callback so
completion will be nil also let's create
a reference toward firebase database
let's call it database where F is equal
to F I our database our database dot
reference in the view did load method
let's first disable the signup button
this will only be enabled once the user
makes entries into the email and
password fields the way we will check
that is we'll set up a method for that
edit changed method and call it text did
change and of type UI text field will
also add the password field to that
click on the password field control drag
from editing changed their text it
change and in this what we'll check is
if email dot text dot characters dot
count is greater than zero and and
password dot text what characters dot
count is greater than zero only then
enable the signup button
else disable the sign-up button
coming to the did sign up button what we
do is the moment the user taps the did
sign up button will disable the sign up
button so that the user does not press
the button by mistake twice and then
we'll sign the user in create user with
email email ill dot text password is
password the text and completion will be
user error in code now its error is not
equal equal to nil basically I was
playing around with the error handling
and I realize that there's one
particular error that it does not
display on its own which is the invalid
email address error which we can cache
by catching the error code so if error
code is equal equal to one seven nine
nine nine then we'll display a message
or invalid email address else if there's
any other error will display the message
using error dot localized description
this here can handle all the errors
except this error so we put that error
ourselves and this will be not equal
equal to nil so what you'll have to do
is we have to set up the error message
label as well so let's control drag a
label to a center create an outlet for
it call it error message
and center horizontally and let's clear
this message out for let's fix the Miss
placements
now else if there is no error then in
the error message just put in a message
saying registered successfully and lock
the user in sign in with email email dot
text and password text get in the
completion will use use an error so
firebase on its own stores the email and
password into a database but we want to
store the email in our own database for
reference since this is inside a
callback we'll also have to add self
these so we lowest if there is no error
in logging the user in straw the details
of the user which is in self door
database ref dot child under a node
called user profiles under that store it
inside the user's UID which we get from
firebase let's store the email address
and again this has to be self once the
user successfully been logged in we will
move the user to another screen by using
self tour perform with segue with
identifier we haven't created that view
yet but let's say that it's called
handle view segue and we don't need any
sender</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
