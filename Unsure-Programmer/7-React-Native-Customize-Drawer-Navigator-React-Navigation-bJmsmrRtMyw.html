create a custom drawn advocator using
react navigation this is how it will
look we have a draw navigator here which
has an image in the top and two icons
along with the names and also we have a
button here which opens up the draw
navigator so let's begin so here in
front of me I have an empty project that
I created with Expo to start with we
need two libraries as always one is a UI
library called native base and the other
one is react navigation obviously to use
the draw navigator so let us quickly
install these so open up your favorite
terminal I'm going to use the one in
Visual Studio code here type in npm
install react navigation and then type
in npm install native base i'm not going
to be installing both of these because
they're already installed in my
application once they both are installed
we're good to go
so let's start by importing the draw
navigator here it will say import draw
navigator from react navigation next
come down here at the bottom now let's
create our draw navigator through say
constant my app is equal to draw
navigator here we'll say home which will
point to the home screen
and we create a Settings tab which will
point to the settings screen so let's
first create these two screens so in the
home screen degeus will import the basic
react component call this home screen
and we'll import certain things that we
need from native base so it's a import
once you got these things imported
that's coming into the render method get
rid of that and we'll put in here a
container which is similar to a view
size that we'll put in the content and
here we'll just create a text and call
it home screen next just copy all this
out create a new file call it setting
screen dodge is here we'll just paste in
the data that we copied just change the
name of the class and here we'll change
this to a setting screen now we have our
two files ready let's import them in
here
in the app dot J's so we'll say import
home screen from home screen import
settings screen home settings now if we
refresh this if you slide from the left
we have our draw navigator and obviously
the text is going outside you can just
correct that say we'll just add some
styles with the content and native ways
to add style to the content into add a
content container style instead of just
a style content is similar to a view so
here we just put in Flex one line items
Center and justify Content Center and
we'll just copy this into our setting
screen and let's refresh this so there
we see the home screen is there in the
middle you can open up the draw
navigator click on settings takes us to
the settings screen so draw navigators
working now it's time start customizing
our own avatar first we'll put in a
header into our screens which has a
button on the Left open the draw
navigator so come here to the top inside
the container
we'll put in something known as a header
as you may remember we've imported head
on the top here from native base inside
the header we'll put this element called
left and inside that we'll put in an
icon name of the icon will be iOS menu
and on press what it will do is it'll
open up the drawer navigator so it's a
on press equal to this dot props not
navigation dot navigate and we'll call
drawer open let us close out the sidebar
and then let's just copy this into our
home screen as well so there you can see
we've got a head on top and we've got a
menu icon if we click on it the sidebar
opens up so that's exactly what we
wanted now it's time to customize this
draw navigator so come to the apt rjs
and here we create our custom draw so we
will say constant custom draw content
component is equal to passing the props
and inside here what we'll say is we
create a container a header inside the
header we'll put in a body and that will
put in an image so we'll get the source
of the image say require I've already
got the image in my assets folder it's
just the logo and also give the image a
height in a width
so did put on a style thing style store
drawer image just need single brackets
I don't create these here at the bottom
so at the bottom here will say drawer
image will just say height to say height
of 150 within width of 150 and a border
radius as well of 75
so that becomes round and here these are
components from native base so we must
import them here at the top so we'll say
import container content header body and
icon from native is an image comes from
react natives will put it in here so now
we've just created a custom component
let's display it in the draw navigator
as well now it doesn't show here so
coming down here in your drawn alligator
we put in a comma here we need to
firstly put it in in children out name
which is mandatory so we'll call it home
next we put it the content component
which is a property provided to us by
react navigation and in that we'll put
in our custom draw component and then we
need three other properties which I'm
just gonna paste in here which are also
mandatory so they are drawer open draw
closed out and toggle route which point
to the particular methods which are
already available in react navigation
but when you're customizing the draw
navigator you must put them in here so
let's save this out now and we see we
get an error here because I made a very
basic mistake and that is with the
brackets these should be rounded
brackets and not curly brackets that's
why nothing is being returned to us so
let's save that again now if you open
this up we see that we're getting the
image but obviously it's not inside the
header that's because we just need to
put in another style to our header so
let's say style equal to just put in the
height here only so it's a height of 200
so now if we open it we will see there
we've got a header which is a height of
200 is got an image inside it but our
drawer items are missing
so let's put in our drawer items here
Syriac navigation provides us with a
simple method to put it in which is put
in another content and inside that we
just need to put something known as
straw items and then we just spread in
the props that is it'll bring out all
the items that are there in the list and
display them but make sure to import
drawer items here from the AK navigation
so let's hit rawr items now if we save
that out we see we're getting our items
here and we're getting an image here you
can also change the background color of
the drawer to white and all we need to
do is put in the icons for the list
items so let's do that come to the home
screen here we configure the navigation
options so it's a static navigation
options is equal to side that will set
the drawer icon pass in the image of the
icon that we want to show it's a source
equal to require the asset from assets
folder also give it a style height of 24
width of 24 because that fits in
perfectly and this needs to brackets and
if we save that out let's see if that
works I need to import in the image here
as well as you can see we've got a home
icon here same thing we'll do for the
settings screen we'll just copy this go
to the settings screen pasted in here
that icon is called settings and here
important image
save that out and there you can see
we've got our custom header with our
custom images with our drawer items
there are a lot of more configurations
that you can do with your drawer
navigator but now you must have
understood that all you need to
basically do is configure the draw
navigator just like any other page and
all you need to pass in is the drawer
items to show them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
