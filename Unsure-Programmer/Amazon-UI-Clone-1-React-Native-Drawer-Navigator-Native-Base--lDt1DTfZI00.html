create the UI of the Amazon app in react
native we're going to be using native
base for the UI components the act
navigation could get the draw to work
and we'll use a component library to
display these stars
this should be fun to build so let's
begin we'll start with an empty react
native project created with Expo for
those of you that are not familiar with
the draw navigator and want to learn how
to create a customized draw navigator
they can check out this other video of
mine the link for which is in the
description and you should see it here
somewhere on the screen as well so let's
begin as first install our dependencies
so I'll open up the terminal we first
installed react navigation NPM install
react navigation next we'll install
native base NPM install native base and
the last thing we'll install is react
native star rating this will help us
display the stars under our item in case
you get a red screen over here just run
NPM install again and the missing
dependencies will be installed now come
to the app drawer yes
I'll start by importing the draw
navigator so it's a import draw
navigator from react navigation here the
bottom let's created so it's a Const
have drawn a vagator create a new draw
navigator the first screen will be a
home screen and will point to screen
which is called home screen as well
let's save that and create the home
screen now so we first create a folder
called screens and inside that will
create home screen not just just import
some boilerplate code and call this home
screen now let's import the home screen
here at the top we'll say import home
screen from screens
home screen so you don't have that error
anymore
here let's display our draw navigator so
get rid of the view put in the app
drawer navigator and we're getting the
home screen here so all the home screen
does is return a tech
it says homescreen now the homescreen is
where we will do most of our work so
let's start by importing a few things we
need from native base to import
container content header left right and
icon from native base this should be
good enough to start with a header now
let's get rid of this view put in a
container which is like a wrapper for
the app inside that we put in the header
and just save it there we see we already
get a nice header and it's absolutely
positioned so that anytime we scroll it
will always stay there let you style it
a little till it's a background color
and give it the dark blue background
color height of 90 and a border bottom
color of darkest gray so that color
looks nice
next we'll put in the left icon here so
it's a left inside that let's put in an
icon name will be MD menu and style
let's give it a color of white and let
us close that out and then we have our
menu icon next to that we need the
Amazon icon which will import from font
awesome so it's a import FA icon let's
call it from react native vector icons
slash font awesome this is already
available to us here below the icon put
in FA icon give it a name of Amazon and
let's style it so we'd say size of 32
and a color of white as we can see the
icon is not in the right place and also
this should be font size that's because
we need to make this flex reaction of
row so in the left put in a flex
direction of row and there we got the
icon where we want it to be let's give
this first icon a margin right of 15 and
that's nicely spaced now for the right
icon just put in a right here
beside that put in an icon of named MD
card give it a color of white and close
that out and then we get a card icon as
well now in an app
we need this head over here at the top
which says shop by category and search
that is also part of this header and is
fixed so for that what we do is we put
in another view which is absolutely
positioned and is 90 from the top so
that it comes right below this so let's
do that come below the header here put
in another view let's style that view
let's position it first it's a position
of absolute left to 0 right of 0 and a
top of 90 with a height of 70 background
color will be the same as the color here
and if we save that out we get the
header here now let's add the shop by
category button here for that let's
import in touchable opacity we put that
in here so touchable opacity inside that
will wrap a view give that a style width
of 100 amp a crown color of that nice
gray a height of 50 and let's save that
so you get a square there which is not
perfectly like what we want
let's give it a border radius of 4 and a
padding of 10 now you want the search
bar to be coming here on the side so for
that let's meet the parent view of Flex
direction of row let's put in align
items of center and let's put in a
padding horizontal of 5 so that's nicely
placed now inside the view let's put in
a text which is a font size of 12 let's
call that shop by and below that put in
another text which is category and let
us make the font weight of this bold
so that looks really nice now let's add
the search bar so below the touchable
opacity put in another view give it a
flex of one so that takes up all the
remaining place a high to 100% and a
margin left of five lets important a
couple of other things so here we first
important an item from nato base and
also the input coming here inside the
view let's put in an item inside which
we have an icon of name search let's
style that give it a font size of 20 and
a padding top of 5 close that out and
below that we'll put in an input with a
placeholder of search let's style the
item now so we'll say background color
of white let's position that correctly
by adding a justify content to the
parent of center let's give the item of
padding horizontal of 10 and give it a
border radius of 4 that looks really
nice just the way we want it to look so
now we're done with the header and we
need to start setting up the content
part which is the name here with the
your account followed by the Swiper so
let's do the first part come below this
view here and put in a Content the
content is just like a scroll view let's
turn the content give it a background
color for darkish great that the app
uses with the margin top of 70 so that
it comes below this there we see the
colors there inside this let's bring a
view
give the view of height of 50 background
color of white a flex direction of row
and a padding horizontal of 5 there we
have that there put in your text inside
this the first one will say hello
followed by the name and the next one
would be a text with an icon so let's
put that into a view let's give that
view also a flex direction of row put in
the icon of named arrow forward and a
style of font size of 18 let's add the
texture which says your account and as
you can see we're getting both the
things but they're not like the way we
wanted to look so for that inside the
main view let's put in a line items of
center and let's print justify content
of space between that moves it nicely to
the end and here all we do is we just
put in a space here so that spaces it
out from the icon so that's quite a bit
for the first part of our video in the
next video we'll set up the rest of the
content view and the items of the drawer
navigator I hope you guys like this
