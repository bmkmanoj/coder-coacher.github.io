any tutorial videos lately it's just
that I've been really caught up with
flying and like I said I've been working
on a project of my own but I really
missed uploading videos for you guys
this is not a tutorial video but this is
a video that's very close to my heart
because being a self-taught programmer
there are a lot of mistakes that I made
as a programmer while learning
programming I didn't have people to go
to I don't have people to guide me but I
feel that these are mistakes that if you
guys can avoid it can help you learn
programming in a better way or are like
I say it's the correct way of learning
programming according to me so there are
about five mistakes mistake number one
according to me is trying to learn
everything before you start building
your product so when you start learning
programming you like it and enjoy it but
soon you realize that the demo projects
that are given in most books on do
toriel videos a very simple projects
your own dream idea that you have seen
and you have that in your mind seems
really far-fetched and complex this
gives you a feeling that maybe I should
try and dig into this particular
language try and learn everything about
this LAN try and learn everything about
this platform before I start building my
product what you will realize in this
process is that learning programming is
an infinite process it can keep going
there is no end to it and what this will
do is this will cause your product to
get delayed you keep learning keep
learning keep learning and you'll think
that there would be a day that you will
feel equipped enough to go ahead and
build your product and then you realize
there are other things that you have to
learn to build it actually because you
never really started building it earlier
so the right way would be to learn the
basics of the language or platform that
you want to build your product on learn
whatever you need to improve the project
as you are building the project this
will really speed up your development
and also give you a better under
standing off that particular language or
platform because you will know and
you'll validate a particular thing in a
real project mistake number two as we're
learning you're going to be distracted
by a lot of the tools software's
libraries hardware's available in the
market this is what happened with me I
started as I started learning more I
started getting to know about more IDs
or text editors or software's and I
thought that oh maybe I should try these
out first maybe they'll help me improve
my programming maybe I should learn that
maybe I should learn this what happens
is it's always great to have good tools
at your disposal but you have to
understand this that the tools are not
gonna build the product for you you
still have to write the code so what I
did was I in fact change multiple IDs
thinking that I should learn phpstorm I
should learn sublime text I should learn
this I learned the keyboard shortcuts
learn vim learn something switch from
Windows to Linux to Mac and wasted a lot
of time in this thinking that this is
gonna help me improve building my
product whereas I could have spent this
time actually building my product with
any ID on any software except obviously
if I want to build app app store app or
Apple app and you took I have a Mac but
I could have build my product long back
I have improved on it also instead of
wasting time learning all these other
things thinking whether this'll help me
improve mistake number three is trying
to optimize too early I always felt that
problem problems are not there in our
programs we programmers try and find
problems as I started becoming a better
programmer I said understanding things
better and was almost ready to build my
app that's just when I got myself caught
up into optimization I read somewhere
that it is good to optimize your code
test your code etc and I thought before
I build my product I must learn this
what happened was that I I mean I
obviously agree that it is important to
test your code it is important to
optimize your code
but what I realized later on was that
the end user is not bothered whether
your code is completely optimized or not
the end users also not bothered whether
you use SQL or used no SQL to handle
your data what the end user is bothered
about which is your main customer is
that does the product work does the
product solve my problem does the
product look nice these are the things
that the user is bothered about but what
you've done till now what I had done
till now in fact was I was just learning
learning learning and not actually
putting it into a product building an
app is not enough people should get it
first so that at least they know that if
they need it or not you keep trying to
improve your app but you will realize
that you haven't gotten our app out and
it's pointless now it's a mistake number
four is feeling under confident or as I
call it unsure as a programmer the name
of my channel says it all as a
programmer I always felt that I was
inferior to other programmers I thought
they had some superpowers which I was
not born with so I feared asking
questions on forums let alone answer any
I feared sharing what I built thinking
people will make fun of what I wrote and
you know the right kind of code I wrote
maybe I'm not doing it right how can I
show that you know they're gonna be like
you don't know this trust me
every programmer is unsure at some level
there is always and always a better way
to try and do something there is no one
right way in programming you should not
be afraid to ask questions
in fact answer people's questions is
whatever knowledge you have and you will
learn when people connect you with some
things or people will appreciate you
which will give you a big motivational
boost it's very important to appreciate
your progress and better yourself on the
bank we as programmers are very very
harsh on ourselves
I was very harsh on myself and this
light leads only to more frustration
thing from where you start and where you
reached learning is always going to be
endless but and there is obviously a
long way to go by
just believe that you are good enough to
start building just know that everyone
else out there is equally doubtful
equally unsure equally trying to improve
as you are you're not the only one
mistake number five this is another
mistake that I made is wasting a lot of
time thinking about me wanting to have a
team to build a product there a lot of
people will tell you you should have a
good team only then you can build a good
product so you can't have everything
it's always good to have equally
motivated ambitious like-minded
interesting intelligent people around
you to help you do exactly what you want
to do but I have a day job maybe a lot
of you have a day job as well and I like
programming after us I hope to build the
next big thing
but being in the profession I mean I
don't have people who are like-minded
around me over the same interests and in
fact programming such a you so tarik
field that you will barely find people
who are around to help you you have to
be really lucky to be in that field so
this used to always create doubts in our
minds that oh alone you know I'm not in
that field I'm not surrounded by people
who are programming will I be able to
build the thing will I should I quit you
know should I try and move to a place
where I can't find people
that's the beauty of this thing in fact
oh yeah in fact they were friends of
mine who have tried to motivate thinking
that if I can motivate them to get into
programming maybe you know we can get
together into it would have to
understand that everyone does not have
the same motivation same interest and
programming does require a lot of
motivation to actually learn it and
build something cool so this is you
create doubts in my mind as to whether I
would be able to do something by myself
or not but as time progressed I realized
that this was just something that I was
creating my mind self-doubt there is
nothing like that that's the beauty of
programming you have one computer and an
internet connection and the world is
yours you can actually end up changing
the world sitting in one corner of your
small room without having the best team
in the world to help you out so these
are the five mistakes that I thought
that I had made which I hope you guys
don't make and they help you improve and
become a better programmer help you
build that dream
product that you want let me know if you
like such videos let me know if you like
this video and please like and subscribe
I'll be more active and I'll be
uploading more videos shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
