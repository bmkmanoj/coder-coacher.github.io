awesome new framework called react
native well most of you may have heard
about react native but have for whatever
reason not given it a try yet well react
native is a JavaScript framework that
lets you build brand for mobile apps
okay but you're thinking there are
already other cross-platform frameworks
like ionic titanium mobile angular
jQuery central touch and the list goes
on
why would I need another framework if
you guys have tried any of those
frameworks you will know that that
performance is nowhere close to a native
app that is because they are hybrid apps
or html5 apps and most of them run the
app inside a web wrapper which is just
like running an app in a web browser
with some additional native features
there is no way that app can match the
performance of a native app this is
where react native is different it uses
the same fundamental UI building blocks
as a regular ios and android app but it
lets you put them together just using
javascript so react native by itself is
extremely powerful and overall quite
easy to use the initial learning curve
for people who are not familiar with
javascript can be a little daunting but
once you get a hang of it trust me
the results are extremely satisfying
however what if I told you it could be
even easier to start building your react
native apps there is something that can
make things even easier for you welcome
Expo so I destroyed your reactant it was
awesome then why Expo the guys at Expo
knew this would be a common question
they would have to answer and have a
nice write-up that I'll walk you through
so what is the difference between Expo
react native you can consider Expo as
like rails for react native or laravel
for PHP or Django for Python lots of
things are just set up for you so it's
quicker to get started and on the right
path
one of the biggest selling points with
Expo is you don't need Xcode or Android
studio you just write JavaScript using
whatever text editor you are comfortable
with and you don't need to get into any
of the native platforms to make any
changes to the settings the expo xde
does that for you out of the box and it
is also supported for all three
platforms Mac Windows and Linux a few
other features are that it has support
for both iOS and Android in react native
what you have to do is you have to write
though you can write all the code in
JavaScript you do have to write them in
separate files for iOS and Android
in case of expo that restriction is
removed you just write your code in one
file and it can be used in both Android
and iOS secondly expo has their own push
notification server will dig into this
in the future videos and I'll show you
how easy it is to send push
notifications they have their own
Facebook login feature which makes it
extremely easy to log into Facebook
instant updating for all of you who have
developed any native apps you know that
it is a pain to build your project and
recompile it after you make the change
in the case of export it works just like
you're making a website you save your
code and it updates on your real mobile
phone not even on the simulator you can
test the app directly on your device and
it will update directly on your device
via Wi-Fi asset management is another
big thing which is helpful when you put
your app out into the App Store's
because all your images videos fonts etc
are stored in the cloud and not directly
in your app also export is really really
active in updating to the latest
releases of react native and there are
very few cases in which you will be
lagging behind the latest update one
small downside which might not be a
downside people just starting out with
react native is that you cannot dig down
deep into the native code and write
native code for your app that is
everything that you write will be in
JavaScript
and the modules that are available with
Expo this I feel is a blessing in
disguise because we're now starting out
you don't want too many options you can
build extremely advanced apps just using
javascript and expo in fact that's the
reason why we went got into the ACMA to
development so that we would not have to
write any native code also expo is
completely free and their plan is to
keep it that way
indefinitely they've kept it open source
from day one that's a good enough reason
to believe that it will remain free for
the future I think we have enough set
and it's time to begin to start building
amazing apps with react native and expo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
