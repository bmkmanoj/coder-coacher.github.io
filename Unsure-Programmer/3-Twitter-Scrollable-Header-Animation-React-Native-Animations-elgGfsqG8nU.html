and the text so let's first change the
view that holds the image to an animated
dot view next we need to have three
constants that we need to P it coming up
let's duplicate the constant that we had
created first let's call this one
profile image height so what we want is
we want the image to decrease in size
and then move under the header so you
want this animation to work in
synchronization with the header
animation so we'll keep the input range
the same the output range will obviously
change you want the output range to be
the profile image max height when the
header is not moved and when the headers
at this minimum height we want it to be
its smallest height which will be
profile image min height these two we
had created in the beginning of the
video now that we've created those let's
add them here in animated view so in our
height let's change that to profile
image height and also let's change the
width to profile image height since it's
a round image and less does that outer
so if we scroll up we see that the image
is decreasing in size as we go up and it
comes back to the size when we come down
we need to also change a few other
properties as you can see that the image
is going above the header and it's also
not getting hidden behind the header so
let's change the margin top of the image
come here let's copy this constant
let's change this to profile image
margin-top again the input range is
gonna be the same as the other two
animations because we want them to work
together the output range is going to be
what we had set up here if you remember
margin top is the maximum height of the
header minus the profile image height
divided by two which is equal to 80
because there's 120 minus 80 divided by
2 so let us copy this paste this in here
so starting margin is the one we had
already set and since off scroll we want
the image to move below the header and
not stay half on it what we'll do is
we'll just use header max height and
save that so if we apply the profile
image margin top here we see the image
comes nicely below the header we can
also just give it a plus five to space
it out little next is one more thing we
need to do that is when we're scrolling
that the image is not going below the
header for that we'll use the property
known as head index so let's create
another constant we'll call this one
head as our index the input range will
remain the same and the output range
will just change from 0 to 1 now let's
just apply this head as our index here
so we create a property called add index
and apply the head as that index here as
you can see the image went under the
header so here it comes on top and then
it goes below it now the last thing we
need to do is show the text that
displays here when the user Scrolls up
so for that let's create a new animated
view so inside the header here we create
a new animated view and inside that
we'll put in a text and we'll get some
Styles font size of 14 and a font weight
of bold let's put in my name that it
also add some styles to the view to
position the text so this style
position:absolute and give it a bottom
of 0 to the header we give any line
items of center so then the text comes
to the center for now we'll just leave
the color black so that you can see the
animation more clearly so let's create a
last constant now copy this one here and
change the name here to a header title
bottom so here the input range we'll use
a few extra values firstly we want the
user to scroll the normal scroll
distance that we've been doing which is
till the time the image becomes small
then we also want the user to scroll the
height of the minimum profile picture
Plus this 5 margin that we had given and
then while scrolling this text here we
want this to display let's first set the
header title bottom here change the
bottom zero to header title bottom now
to start with let's give the first
position as minus 20 we see the text
moves below then for the second position
we'll say that the user has scroll till
this point even then we want the
position of the text to be minus 20
let's just get rid of the third one here
first
next we want the user to scroll the
image plus the margin so it's a header
max height minus header minimum height
plus 5 which is the margin plus the
height of the minimum profile picture
and for the third value as well we want
this to be minus 20 so if we see her the
user Scrolls the first part is the first
goal then the image in the margin is
crawled the text is the same place when
these two come aligned with each other
that's we move on this text to start
moving if I wanted I could put all these
animations in
together into one input range but just
for clarity I spread them out so the
last thing we need to do now is to
actually move the text so let's copy
this last distance that we have scroll
and that we just add the height of the
font which is 26 as the font size is 26
it's approximately that and for that we
want to move this to zero let's say that
and let's check that out and as you can
see the text starts moving for more
clarity that's change the color to white
now if we say that that's gone and as we
come up here we see the text coming up
so that's all for this tutorial I hope
you guys like this this Twitter
animation is finally complete please let
me know how you liked it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
