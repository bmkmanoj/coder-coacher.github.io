view controller so as you can see in our
home tab we can see all the tweets that
we had made and you can also send new
tweets which get updated on top of these
tweets in this part we will continue by
creating the profile page of the user
which is under the me tab so let's begin
coming to the main storyboard in front
of us we have the me view in this view
we'll start by adding an image view to
the top this will be the cover photo of
the user let's add its constraints give
it a height it's an approximate height
I'm not going to the exact dimensions
but it'll look approximately like an
actual Pratap let's give it a default
image of one of the images I have an
assets folder change scale to film to
aspect fill below this let's add a UI
view
let's add the constraints for this as
well the UI view will basically contain
a header with some details and below
that we'll have a table view which will
show all the tweets the media and the
likes of the user so let's do that let's
start by adding another image view which
would be the profile picture of the user
set the height and width to 80 and let's
add its constraints top spacing healing
space and height in width
let's give it a default image of the
Twitter icon for now we'll allow the
user to select and upload a unique
profile picture later to the right of
this let's add a horizontal stack view
let's add three buttons in that
come to the button let's change these
buttons this one's going to be called
settings we have a Settings icon for
this in the assets folder the next one
will have text and will be called logout
the last one let's call it edit profile
let's move the stack go to the right
let's set up the constraints for this
give it a distribution of fill
proportionally and give it a spacing of
15 below the image we'll add two labels
let's spread this out to the width of
the image and we call this one name
Center align it and we'll set its
constraints and give it a vertical
spacing below that we'll add a label
give it a vertical spacing Center
horizontally and call this handled
reduce its size to 13 and centreline it
coming here let us fix the constraints
of this below this let's add a text
field
let us call this about the user can add
a quirk about himself centerline the
text again give it a leading spacing
from here to maintain the symmetric and
a trailing spacing here and satisfied I
also give it a vertical spacing from the
handle below this will add two more
labels to show the users followers and
how many people the uses following let's
set this one to 100 and this one to 100
as well let's add the constraints and
vertical spacing and for this one but I
said horizontal spacing and Center
vertically below this will add a
segmented control basically this will
let us toggle between our tweets media
and likes so let's change this to three
segment zero let's call this one tweets
segment one let's call this one likes
well let's call this one media segment
two let's call this one likes and let's
set its constraints as well vertical
spacing and for this one let's add
leading and trailing
and it's let's also set up the height
below the segmented control we'll add
three containers which will show each
respective tab when it is clicked so
let's do that
drag container view below this and satis
constraints
similarly drag two more container views
and set their constraints as well
so basically one will show the tweets
one will show the media and one and show
the likes let us add three labels for a
reference and they'll just quickly sent
rely on all of these
let's set up a controller for this me
tab let's call that me new controller
let's add the controller here select the
me tab and call this me view controller
open up the split editor and let's set
up the outlets for the container views
so let's call this outermost one tweets
container this one will be called media
container and the last one should be
called likes container control drag from
the segmented view and connections this
called show components let's get rid of
this code here basically over here we'll
check which tab was clicked and
depending on that will change the
visibility of the other tabs to zero by
changing the alpha value so let's see
how we'll do that you'll say if sender
dot selected segment index equal equal
to 0 that is the tweets tablet we put in
an animation using animated duration
give it a duration of 0.5 seconds when
we say self-taught tweets container rod
alpha equal to 1 self-taught media
container dot alpha equal to 0 and
surfed or likes container dot alpha
equal to 0 else if sender dot selected
segment index equal equal to 1 again
we'll put in the UI view to our animator
duration self dot media container dot
alpha equal to 1 self-taught tweets
container dot alpha
equal to zero and self dot likes
container tour alpha equal to zero as
well
else we can assume that the like star
bus clicked and we said that alpha value
to one its animate with duration
duration will be point five again self
dot likes container dot alpha equal to
one
self taught tweets container tour alpha
equal to zero and self dot media
container dot alpha equal to zero as
well if you run this that the segmented
control should work so let's try this
now we have the home view coming to the
meet and there we see the tweets tab is
first selected let's go to media you see
a nice animation in media comes up we go
to like and we see a nice animation
'likes comes up so I thought I'll keep
this video limited only to the layout
part of the meal you in the next part
we'll set up the code that enables the
logout button allows the user to select
a unique profile picture from either the
camera all the photo library allows the
user to update a quark about himself
which live updates in the database and
also set up the tweets media like steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
