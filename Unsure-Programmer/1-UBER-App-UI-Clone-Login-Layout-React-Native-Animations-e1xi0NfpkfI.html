how to create the UI of the uber app to
start with today I'll show you how to
create the login screen which has some
really nice animations so this is how
it's gonna look there you can see when
it starts out it gets a nice animation
when the image comes in and the screen
from the bottom of the slides in nicely
now if you click on enter your mobile
number we see the screen nicely animates
up with this enter mobile number moving
to the top this back arrow appearing and
this forward arrow appearing just like
the uber app if we click this back arrow
here now it nicely sized back down with
the get moving with uber coming back and
settling into its original position
this demo is correctly playing on my
iPhone 6 which I'm mirroring on my
screen all the animations that we're
gonna build here are gonna be completely
in react native this should be fun to
build and you guys will enjoy this so
let's begin so as always we started with
an empty react native project created
with Expo and you have my phone 10
simulator running up so we start by
installing some dependencies first one
that we installed is going to be react
navigation so that we can set up a nice
navigation for the rest of our tutorial
as well so npm install react navigation
next with install this library called
animatable though most of our animations
are going to be custom we use this just
for the layout animation so to say npm
install react native animatable and the
last library we're going to be
installing is native this and PM install
native base again most the components
that we're going to be using are gonna
be normal react native components but
just for a few components we'll use
native base so that it looks nicer we
may get this red screen when you install
this so just run npm install to install
the missing dependencies once that's
done just restart your project and we
should be good to go so now that our
project will be started let's start by
importing the stack navigator in a wrap
torch is simple start navigator from
react navigation come down here let's
create it so let's say constant let's
an app stack navigatin of type stack
navigator we have only one screen as of
now called login screen now the fire
little point two is also going to be
called
login screen next let's get rid of this
view over here and put in the abstract
navigator obviously we haven't created
the login screen now so we're getting an
error so let's create that let's create
a folder called screens and inside that
let's create the login screen
so in our login screen I'm just going to
import some boilerplate code which just
displays login screen when the screen is
viewed and here on top let's import
login screen inside apt or jeaious so as
we can see a login screen is displaying
we're getting this header on the top
which we don't want to select quickly
get rid of that so come inside the login
screen and let's try it static
navigation options is equal to header of
null and as we can see our header is
calm let's have a look at what we're
trying to create so this is the UI that
were looking for we have a top half
which has the image and the logo in the
middle and then we have this bottle map
over here so let's first create a view
with the Flex of one I'm going to get
rid of this view I'm going to be using
all inline styles so that they easy to
understand and inside this we'll put in
something known as an image background
so let's import the image background
from react native inside the image
background is where we're going to put
in the other components so this image
background will take up the complete
screen it has a source of an image that
I've put in my assets folder let's say
it's called login underscore BG for me
and we'll also give this a flexo one so
that it covers the complete screen so
that we see we've got our background
image so inside this will have another
view which will be the top half will
give this view of LexA one
inside this we'll put in another view
which will have to be written inside it
so it said text and we call that uber so
let's start this early we want the uber
text to be centered so to the outside
view let's put in an justify content of
center and align items of center also we
want to have a background color of white
so then the view inside will give it a
background color of white and also let's
give it a height and width of 100 and
also let's align the text inside this as
well the line item Center justified
content center let's just also make the
font-weight:bold and set the font size
to 26 that looks better now let's get
the bottom half so inside image
background will create one more view
this we will be divided into two parts
so let's create the bottom part first
which is this photo here which has all
connect using a social account so for
that view let's give that a style
through this style is equal to give it a
height of 70 and a background color of
white for now so that we've got our
footer inside this let's put in our text
text let's say or connect using a social
account
let's style the text
has given a color nice blue color and
font weight of mold now let's get the
text in the right place per styling its
parent element will say aligned items of
center justify content of center let's
give it a border top color for a nice
light gray the border width of one and a
padding horizontal of 25 also we don't
want it to be actually in the center so
let's say a line items to flex start
that looks much better
now we're looking to create this top
half of the bottom you get moving with
hooba for that come here I'm just gonna
comment this make it a little more
clearer this is the bottom half inside
that we have one main view and then we
had this photo inside so we create
another view here let's style that suits
his style is equal to give it a height
of 150 and a background color white as
well this height is going to be dynamic
in the future for now to start out I'm
just setting it as 150 so here you see
we getting a white background here but
this border is going out that's because
we just need a border top with the one
and the rest of the borders are not
required once we set that we see we're
getting this nice divider line so first
thing inside this view we'll put in the
get moving with Rupert text by putting
that inside another view by having
multiple views because we're going to be
animating all of them so let's put in
the texture let's just give it a font
size of 24
and let us place it in the center align
items of flex start padding horizontal
of 25 and a margin top of 25 that we
have in the right place this margin top
is going to be animated later and also
we'll put an opacity value here of one
right now which we will animate later
now for the text input here let's first
import the text input and we'll also
import touchable opacity since you want
the text input to be clickable so below
the get moving with overview we'll put
in touchable opacity and inside that we
put in a view let's give that viewer
style so you want to have a margin top
of 25 which is also going to be animated
padding horizontal of 25 a flex
direction of row so inside this the
first item is going to be the image
which is gonna be the flag so we put an
image let's make sure that we imported
image here at the top so it's a source
require and from my assets folder look
at the image of the Indian flag and
let's style the image to give it a
height of 24 and a width of 24 with the
resize mode of contain and they were
getting the flag like we expected now
let's put in another view here for the
tax input we want two parts of that text
input the first one should be this text
here which is a text view and the other
one should be the text input
so let's style this view it's a flex
direction of Rho flex 1 so it takes up
the rest of the space that's available
over here and that inside that we'll
just put in the text so there we got the
text doesn't look like the way we wanted
to
let's style it you wait a font size of
20 and a padding horizontal of 10 that
looks better
below the stacks let's put in a text
input
let's tell the text to input with a flex
of one again font size of 20
let's print placeholder enter your
mobile number and for Android phones is
put in underlined color Android equal to
transparent there we see we're getting
the text just like the way we want it so
now we have the building blocks in place
in the next video we'll start animating
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
