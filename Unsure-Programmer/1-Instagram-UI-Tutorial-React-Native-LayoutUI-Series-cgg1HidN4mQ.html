create the UI of the Instagram app using
react native this is how the app would
look which is quite similar to the
actual Instagram app so as you can see
we have all the tabs that are there in
the app obviously have not set up all
the tabs yet it's only the feed tab that
I've set up and all the icons are also
similar to the real app just a reminder
that this is just the UI of the
Instagram application and not a
functional Instagram app so let's begin
so as always to begin with I've got an
empty react native project that I
created with Expo first things first
let's install the libraries that we need
so we're going to be installing native
base my favorite UI library to create
react native apps and along with that
for navigation we need react navigation
so let's install those it's a NPM
install native base and the next thing
we're going to be installing is react
navigation so npm install react
navigation once that's installed we'll
just run npm install once again just to
ensure that all the dependencies that
are required are installed so now once
that's done let us refresh our project
and we're good to go so let's start with
the apt rjs and create a stack navigator
come to the top here and import the
stack navigator next let's create the
stack navigator
so we got the navigator abstract
navigator inside that will have only one
screen which is called the main screen
and it's gonna point to the screen which
is also gonna be called main screen so
let's create the main screen the first
create a folder called components and
inside that will create the file main
screen dot yes here I'll just import
some boilerplate code all to do is
return a text field which says main
screen
so let's import the main screen into our
app now and let's display our stack
navigator
so get rid of this view from here and
pass in abstract navigator that we had
created let's save that and reload our
fan there we see we getting the main
screen text that we have displayed so
let's start by setting up our navigation
bar
we'll come here to the main screen dot
yes import icon from native this and
we'll modify the navigation options of
the react navigator so here we'll say
static navigation options and that will
put in a header left here we'll set up
the icon for the camera
pass in the title which is gonna be
Instagram and we put in a header right
which will be the send message icon so
let's save that up as you can see we've
got both the icons so let's just add
some styles to position them correctly
so it's a style padding-left of 10 and
on the other one will say style padding
dived of 10 now let's set up our tab
navigator at the bottom so here on top
let's first import the tab navigator
from react navigation
next let's create the tab navigator who
is a constant app tab navigator here we
have to create five dams
so you have just created the five types
the Home tab search tab add media tab
likes tab in the profile tab now we have
to create the files for these tabs so
inside the components folder
I'm creat a new folder called apt and
navigator so inside the app tab
navigator will treat the files the first
one is Home tab door Cheers
next is Search tab dot yes add media tab
note is like stabbed or j/s and the
profile tab no chiz so we have a five
files created here as always I'll just
import the boilerplate code inside them
I'll show you one of them so this is
just going to be called add media tab
and all it does is returns the text add
media tab similarly for the other files
I'll put in the same stuff now I need to
import these files in our main screen so
come to the main screen here on top
let's import all these in now that we
have all the files imported let's
display a tab navigator come here into
the render method and get rid of this
and display the app tab navigator here
once we save that out we can see her
that our tabs have come here however we
do not have icons for the tabs so let's
set up the icons so we'll set up the
icons in the individual files open up
the Home tab here just import icon on
top
and we'll be using the navigation
options to set up the icon so come here
with say static navigation options say
tab bar icon is the option on a set pass
in a prop call tint color which will
declare in the main tab navigator inside
here will say icon named iOS home style
will be color which will equal to the
tint color that we passed then here this
back it should be around bracket and not
a curly bracket let's save that out and
then we can see our home tab is showing
a home icon so Allah's copy/paste these
options and the import icon to the other
files and then we'll set up the icons
for those files so as you can see over
here we've got icons for all the tabs
but they're all the same so let's just
change the icons are now in the Search
tab we'll call the icon iOS search in
the add media tab we'll call it iOS and
circle in the likes tab
we'll call it iOS heart and the profile
tab we'll call it person
so that we can see we've got tabs
similar to the ones in Instagram but we
obviously don't want to show the text
below that so we just change some
settings in our app tab navigator come
to our main screen and here below the
screens we'll put in the properties so
let's say animation enabled equal to
true swipe enabled will be true tab bar
position just to ensure this fine rod as
well we will say bottom and then we need
to put in tab bar options so we'll come
in here will say tab bar options inside
that we'll put in the other options
which is active tint color we'll put
that in as black when the tab is active
inactive tint color which will be a gray
and show label will be false which will
remove the text and show icon will be
true which is required for Android so as
you can see that the text is gone and
icons are showing we also need to put in
one more property which is required for
Android otherwise the tab bar doesn't
show so inside the tab bar option will
say style and that will put in platform
select and that will select Android and
we need to put in the background color
of white otherwise it will show as a
blue we have two colons here scattered
of that and here we'll just put in a
comma and import platform here from
react native so as you can see over
there we've got our tabs here in our
tamper we've got the icons in our
navigation bar if we click these icons
here we can see a nice swipe animation
is coming due to this animation enabled
and also we can swipe here to make sure
that we change the tabs in the next
video I'll show you how to create the
component inside the field screen till
then you guys can try this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
