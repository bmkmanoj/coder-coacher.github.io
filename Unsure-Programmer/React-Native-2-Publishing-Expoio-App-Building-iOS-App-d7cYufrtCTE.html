had built a Android app and pushed its
binary to our remote servers using
export in this video I'll show you how
to build our iOS app starting out in our
project folder in the terminal we need
to make sure that we're logged in to
export so just type in exp log in it
already shows that I am logged in so I
will remain logged in as myself next run
exp build iOS so like in our Android app
we let Expo handle all our credentials
Apple will then ask for your user ID and
password and again it'll ask you if you
want to provide your own distribution
certificate but in our case we'll just
let Expo handle it for us also for the
post certificate will let x1 handle it
seems like I'm getting this error which
has multiple profiles found with the
same name let's try and change our
bundle identifier for iOS and see if
that works
so in app dot JSON I'm just going to
change this to two I think this is more
of an issue because I'd already uploaded
this app and I'm trying to do it again
also I'm just going to run local off
with a dash C again this removes all
credentials that existed earlier and
tries to build em again
and then we see a bill process is
started and there should not be an error
now and then we've got a link to our iOS
application bundle let's check that out
and as you can see the build is in
progress just one more thing I want to
point out here you might get another
error when you try and run this line of
code here exp bill is local auth - see
that's because when you were trying to
audio build your distribution
certificates might have got published
and you will get this error saying that
maximum number of certificates generated
so all you need to do is you need to
come to your developer console and here
when you come into all you will see
these certificates here so just select
them and click on revoke once these are
cleared then you can try the build
process again and there should be no
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
