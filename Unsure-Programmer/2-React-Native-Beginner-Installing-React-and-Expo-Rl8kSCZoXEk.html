extremely easy it is to get started the
react native there are two main ways for
you to create a new react native project
the first is from the official
documentation of react native here we
are in the official documentation in
front of you you see two options one is
a quick start and one is the building
projects with native code what we're
interested in is the Quick Start the
Quick Start would ask you to install the
create react native app module using the
node package manager this will require
you to have node installed on your
machine in case you do not have node
installed you can click on this link
over here which will take you to the
official website of node where you can
install the node for your particular
operating system once create react
native app is installed you can easily
create your react app and then test it
out on expo so this is the first way of
creating your app you type in this line
of code here to install the create react
native app module and then you can use
the create via react native app module
to create a new project however the
second and even easier way is to first
download the expo client from the expo
app set see here we are on the expo
website you can just click on the
download our tools button and download
the client for your particular operating
system the expo client is an all-in-one
solution for creating react native apps
and this is what we will use for the
rest of the tutorial you will require
minimal access to the terminal and most
of the time you won't even require to
access it everything can be done from
this in the UI interface of Expo so I
already have Expo installed so let's
open up Expo as you can see Expo has an
extremely clean interface we have an
option to either create a new project or
open an existing one so let's start by
creating a new project
let's just call it my new project which
is the default name and let's click
create and let export do its magic it's
going to download the required project
files and create your react native
package for you to use directly out of
the box no command-line tools required
and it can be directly done on the
simulator or your real device so there
we have it the project has been
downloaded and created all we need to do
here is click on device and click on
open on iOS simulator most of the people
on a Mac will have Xcode installed and
that's where it gets the simulator that
is trying to use from here
there you see the option of open and
expose in front of us
opens up give you a welcome to Expo
message and will tell you the things you
can do you an option to refresh copy the
link code at the expo home reload
disabled right live reload show
performance monitor topic the element
expector and debug remote javascript
which is an exceptional feature which
will dig into later as a now just click
on got it and there it is we have our
first react native app running on our
iOS simulator for those of you who want
to try it directly on your phone you can
just click on this share button here
download the export app on your iOS or
Android device and you can directly just
scan the QR code and the app will
display life on to your phone I know I
did say that you would not need to use
Xcode or Android studio but just for the
simulators you do need to have them both
installed for those of you wanting to
test out your app on Android just make
sure that when you come into Android
studio you have a particular type of
simulator installed basically in the AVD
manager what you need to make sure is
that the Android device that you install
has here the Google API is install with
it these are important for react native
to work as there are times in which it
does create a problem on devices that do
not have the Google API as installed
that's all once you have that set up you
can start the AVD from here and then you
can go into device and run on android so
now that we have the app created we're
going to open up the app folder in our
editor of choice in my case that editor
is going to be Visual Studio code here
we have this editor it's a beautiful
editor what is the name of the project
which we called my new project and click
on open as you can see these files are
opened up over here and we have one file
over here which is the apt or trace file
which were concerned about right now in
the app dot J's you can see the code
that's displayed on the simulator is
typed over here you can just get rid of
that code and this type hello and I just
saved the file over here as you see when
I save the file over here it's creating
an update over here there you can see
that the text is updated that's how
simple it is to get up and running with
Expo and react
next we'll dig into react native and
start building our first project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
