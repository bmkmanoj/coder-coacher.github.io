on how to use firebase with react native
let's begin let's first open up Expo
create a new project let's call it react
fire this the project is created as
always let's change this to localhost
click on host localhost and open this on
our iOS simulator so there we have the
app open up now let's open the app in a
favorite code editor in my case that's
Visual Studio code now that we have the
product open up next we need to install
firebase into our project solo open up
the terminal and type NPM install
firebase now ef5 is installed it seems
like we have some error in the npm
modules so let us run npm install
like I showed in my previous video there
seems to be some error with the app
entry dot J's file which gets fixed if
redone npm install once that's done
we'll just refresh the project and the
app should be working here now that we
have fibrates installed when you set it
up in our project coming to our app dot
yes we need to add some configuration
data which we can add to the top here so
I'll just paste that in and walk you
through it
it's basically here if you have a look
it says import all which is a star as
firebase from firebase this gives us the
capability of using all the firebase
methods in our application next we have
to initialize firebase so we create a
constant called firebase conflict inside
that we store all the information
regarding our firebase application which
is the API key the domain the page URL
and the storage pocket this will get
once we create the project in our
firebase console next we just run
firebase
initialize app with the firebase
conflict then we can run the firebase
functions that are available in the SDK
so let's go ahead and create a firebase
project open up the browser and head to
firebase tour google.com and sign in to
your account of create a new account and
click on get started
then go ahead and add a new project
what can I call it is the act 5 is leave
the country as it is and create the
project once you hear what we'll use is
we will say add firebase to your web app
as you can see over here the config file
is almost very similar to the one we had
copied there what we need from here is
the API key the auth domain database URL
and the project ID and we can copy in
the storage bucket as well so let's copy
that come back to our project and paste
it in there that's all we really need to
do and now we can use firebase in our
project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
