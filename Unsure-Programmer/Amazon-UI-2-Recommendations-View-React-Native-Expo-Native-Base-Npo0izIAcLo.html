of our Amazon app and this video will
concentrate on the content view I did
notice a lot of people having issues
with the UI related to the Android app
so I thought I'll just develop them
simultaneously fixing the errors as they
come along first thing we'll do is we
start by fixing this issue with the
header so in our home screen come to the
top here an import platform and status
bar from the ACK native next come to our
styles and create a style here called
Android header inside that I'll paste in
a style basically what it does is it
says platform dot select selects the
Android platform and applies a padding
top which is equal to the status bar
height so that this moves down next come
to a header let's wrap this into an
array so that we can add our style put
in a comma here and ID style start
Android header as you can see the icons
have now nicely moved to the center now
it's time to add a swiper here below
this so forgot to tell you to install
the react native swiper we can do that
right now open up the terminal and type
in npm install react native swiper once
that's done you can continue the further
video in which we import the react
native swiper so that lets import a
swiper so it's a import swiper from
react native swiper come down here in
our content below this view let's put in
the sniper swiss a style is equal to
high 200 and also inside the swiper we
want three images so let's put in three
views with a flex of one
and inside that we'll put in images I've
already got three images in my assets
folder you can take any three images
that you want before we put the image
that's imported here so let's say image
from the AG native come down here you
need an image of source equal to and
require the image it's in my assets
folder inside that I should be having
three images but I already have two
swiper images so I'll just duplicate one
of them let's call it Swiper - so there
we have the image but it's obviously not
styled the way we wanted to so let's add
some styles to the image first thing we
need is a flex of one height of null and
width of null and a resize mode of
contain so there we getting our first
image let's just copy this image paste
it in here and I'll just name the second
one Swiper three and let the last one be
Swiper - only now we want the Swiper to
be playing automatically for that we
adhere to Swiper has a proc called
autoplay and we'll just set that to true
and then we can see how Swiper is
working now we need to add the card item
here at the bottom which holds our
recommendations for that let's import in
card here at the top so we need God card
item now come down here below our Swiper
so card inside that let's put in a card
item and native base has a property
called header here so let's put in
header this will be the text on top
let's put in a text the text will be
your recommendations so your
recommendations are showing up next
below the car item we'll create a custom
item which will display our particular
recommendations so for then let's create
a new component feel first create a
components folder inside which will
create a recommended card item dot J's
just import some boilerplate code here
let's call that recommended card item
so inside the recommended card item will
import certain things from native base
this will import god card item right
from native base let's get rid of this
view here let's put in a card item
inside that let's put in a view which
has an image of style height of 90 width
of 90 and the source of the image again
for my assets folder and we'll say
recommended one and it seems like my
machine is having a bit of a hard time
running to simulators so I'll just close
the Android simulator for now I'll just
use the iOS simulator once we're done
I'll run it on the Android device and
show you that it's working see here and
recommended card on top let's import
image in and save that out before we
create anything more in this let's go to
the home screen and import that he act
component in here so it's a import
recommended card item from components
recommended card item come down here
below the card item put in the
recommended card item and there we can
see our image
let's pass in some props to this so it's
the item name is equal to you can hear
your life item Creator is equal to
Louise here item price is equal to let's
put in $10 savings is equal to 2.5 and
image URI is equal to let's require it
from the assets folder we'll get the
first image which is recommended one and
let's also pass in a rating which is
equal to 5 let's save that and use this
props here let's get rid of the image
here and in the source
let's put in this dot props dot image
URI and now we can see the image is
still there below the view let's put in
a write component here and inside this
let's put in the name of the item so it
put a text and we'll say this dot props
dot item name and below that we put in
the item creator's name so it's a text
this dot props dot item creator and let
us style this so to the right will give
a flex of once that takes up all the
remaining place give it in a line items
of flex star so that it comes to the
left give it a height of 90 and a
padding horizontal of 20 next with style
the item creator by giving it a gray
color and reducing the font size to 11
that looks much better
you'll also put in another text which
has the item price so it's a this dot
prop store item price lets style this as
well so it's a font size of 14 font
weight of bold and a nice red color that
looks like just what we want the last
thing you need to add is the savings so
let's put another text which has another
text inside it first one we'll say you
save and in the next one we'll put in
this dot props not saving and since we
didn't pass in the dollar sign there
we'll put in the dollar here and save
that so let's style you save over here
let's give it a style color of gray
again font weight of 300 and a font size
of 11 and the 300 should be in quotes
that looks much better
let's paste it out by putting a space in
here and now we just need to put in the
star rating so that lets import the star
rating component we'll say import star
rating from react native star rating
we've already installed that in the
beginning if you remember and here we'll
just say star rating close that out now
we need to pass in some props first we'd
say disabled is equal to true because we
don't want the user to be setting the
stars will say max stars is equal to 5
rating is equal to this star props dot
rating we'll put in a star size
as 12 and we'll put in a full star color
of orange so that when the stars are
full it shows orange and also when it's
empty we leave it as orange is equal to
orange and there you can see we are
getting our star as well so our
component is ready it's just that I need
to change this width to 60 which that's
what we want and now we come out to the
homescreen and duplicate this and as you
can see we've got three items let's just
change these images and there are images
I've also updated before we change this
other content I'll just come here style
the header a little bit so this style is
equal to we'll give it a border bottom
width of one and a border bottom color
of a nice gray they were getting a line
and also to the card let's add a style
which gives it a margin so it's a style
margin left of five and a margin right
of five so the card is nicely spaced
from the edges we can just make the
second one uncharted for the Creator
we'll put in Sony price we'll put in
19.99 savings we'll put in 17 and star
rating will have to be 5 for UFC we'll
put in eaufc 3 in creator we'll put in
EA sports in the price let's make that
44 and savings will be 6 with a rating
of 3 so their components are nicely
updated I just asked this out on my
samsung s 8 plus and it looks exactly
the same what were left with is one more
item at the bottom I'll show you how to
create that and then we'll modify our
drawer navigate on the side so that it
opens on pressing this button and that
list looks like the way we wanted to
look thank you once again for watching I
hope you guys like this please like and
