application and I won't ready to submit
it to the App Store as always submitting
things to the Apple Store is always the
tedious process
let me help break it down for you so
assuming you've downloaded your IPA file
from the link that Expo generates for us
we need to go into our iTunes Connect
account so head to iTunes Connect or
Apple comm from there select my apps
here click on the plus button select new
app we'll select the platform as iOS and
we'll call the app react news - primary
language will select English UK and in
the bundle ID you should see another
bundle ID which is below this wildcard
ID which should look similar to the ID
in your app drawer JSON so it should
look identical to the bundle identify
you had put here in my case it's not
showing the bundle identifier because
while I was trying to record this video
I created the app by mistake and Apple
does not allow you to delete an app once
it has been created even if you are not
submitting it to the App Store so if I
had to do this again I would have to
create a new bundle identifier and build
the app again so just to save time
just select the bundle identify the
shows below this and for the SKU is just
a unique name for the app we just call
it react news - and then click create
once the app is created you can select
the app and you'll be taken to the app
information page here we already have
the name of the app the privacy policy
and the subtitle are optional let's
select a category in my case it's called
magazines and newspapers and the
secondary category is optional click
Save here and then head to pricing and
availability here let's make the price
free and the rest of the details are not
important
come to prepare for submission save this
out first come to prepare for submission
here we need to put in some app reviews
and screenshots so what we do is we
select the 5.5 inch display and let's
choose the files
I already have the screenshots here so
I'll just select the 5.5 inch screen
shots let's save that out so apple also
wants you to add an app review in my
case I don't have an app preview that
meets the resolution requirements for
the 5.5 inch display so we'll head into
the view all sizes in media manager
inside here what we'll do is we deselect
the 4.7 inch display from here to put in
separate images and an app preview so
I've got screenshots of my 4.7 inch
display I'm just gonna drag those in you
can get all these screenshots and app
reviews from the simulator itself and
also let's put in the app preview so the
resolution for the 4.7 inch display is 7
15 to 1 3 3 4 and for the 5.5 inch
display you need 1 9 to 0 into 1 0 8 0
next let's save this out let's head back
to the app it's coming down here for the
promotional text you can just put in
this is the coolest news app you can put
in some keywords that you need news
latest news will just be a little lazy
here and the description can be anything
about the app it's mandatory to have a
support URL so in my case I'll just put
in my website so the app and the
marketing URL is optional next it
doesn't work on iMessage or the Apple
watch and here we need to upload the
build so since we already have IPA
created we need to upload the pill using
this application called the application
loader so I'm assuming most of us have
Xcode 6 or later open up Xcode click
here on the top on Xcode go to developer
tool and select application loader sign
in to your Apple account
and then choose your IPA click open next
and that's it it'll create your bundle
and upload it to iTunes Connect this
process can take sometimes close to
seven to ten minutes if you don't want
to use Xcode you can also download the
application loader as a separate
application and upload the bundle you
can just click here on this button and
we'll start the download for the
application loader so the application
loaders job is complete next just come
here to the activity menu and you will
see a section which says all builds
under that you'll see our first build
that's created and you have the details
of the build come back to the App Store
prepare for submission and back here
we'll click this plus button it allows
us to select the build and click done so
as you can see our app icon has already
come in expo you have to provide this
iPAQ icon for it to display here
otherwise you can upload the app back on
yourself as well and the copyright I'm
just going to put in my name and sign in
is not required in my app and here I've
selected manually release the version
and save that out then here you can see
you can click on submit for review when
you click on submit for reviews it gives
us an error here and it says you have to
add at least one screenshot for the iPad
as well so we just choose a file and
then have screenshot for the iPad I'm
just gonna put that in I've noticed
mostly when you get a response from the
app store team they would have tested
your app on the iPad and not on an
iPhone if your app works both on the
iPad and the iPhone it's good to have
the iPad images so iPad image has been
updated but we've lost all the other
data that we'd fed in so I'll just pour
in that here so after adding the data
instance submitting the app we should
have some errors we come down here we
see it says to submit an app with
Academy magazines and newspapers you
must offer at least one auto renewables
subscription also here it says you must
also add a content rating so let's edit
this and I'll just fill this in click
done
next let's save this out and had to app
information here let's change the
category from magazines newspapers to
education and save this out head back to
prepare for submission and let's submit
for review again so last thing that we
need to do is we need to set up the
export compliance content rights and
advertising identifier so export
compliance select no for content right
select no and for the advertising
identifier export by default uses yes so
you must select yes Thep because if we
select no we'll see we get an error so
there you can see it already says your
app is using the advertising identifier
so just select yes
next is magnet you to select this
attribute this app installation to a
previously served advertisement and also
attribute an action taken within this
app to a previously served advertisement
only select serve advertisement within
the app if you actually serve
advertisements also select limit ad
tracking in settings in iOS and now we
are ready to go click Submit and your
app should be submitted for review and
there you can see we were finally done
with this video and our app is in the
App Store for review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
