next thing we need to do is we need to
write the code that connects our layout
with our firebase database so let's open
our firebase console and go into our app
inside I have what we do is we click on
authentication and click on setup
assignment method here let's enable
email password authentication that's all
we require to do in the firebase console
let's come back to the code editor here
as you remember from the first video of
the series we hid added firebase to our
application and we imported firebase
here at the top also before we start let
us create one more button here which is
going to be the sign up button so just
copy this button down here call the Tex
sign up and change the type to primary
there we have the sign up button ready
this make it a little better that still
change the color of the text from black
to white
I'm just gonna paste that in here that
looks better and we're ready to go so
first let's create the constructor
method which should hold the state is
coming in to the top above the render
method let's create the constructor
passing the props and always call super
props when creating the constructor
inside this let's set the state first
one will be email second all with
password here we'll create two methods
now when we sign up user should take the
email and the password second will be a
login user method it should also take
the same parameters now let's set these
two methods on the buttons coming here
the first button which is a login button
will say on press is equal to this star
login user and pass in the email and the
password users entered so we say this
dot state dot email comethis told state
our password
coming here to the signup button in the
one press we'd say this dot signup user
would say this dot state dot email and
they start state dot password so we've
added the methods to the buttons there
is no place for updating the state of
the email of the password so let's do
that in the input method of email we
draw a non change text method which will
take the email and update it to the
state by using this dot set state and it
for an email
then on the other input method you do
the same thing let's say on change text
is equal to password they start set
state password for Theon change text
methods to basically is anytime a user
enters anything in the email of password
text fields the particular states are
updated simultaneously next let's write
the code for the signup user and the
login user methods so when the user
clicks the signup button you should try
and sign up the user in the firebase
database what we do is we put a try and
catch block here so the catch block is
basically handling any error inside our
try block and passing it off here for us
so we'll just to consult or log error to
string in the try block let's run the
method that firebase provides us to
create the new user for that we'll just
run a small check to see if the password
entered by the user it's greater than 6
characters or not so you say if this dot
state dot password dot length is less
than 6 alert to the user
please enter at least 6 characters and
with this return so that the rest of the
method does not run otherwise if the
password is above 6 characters we can
just run firebase dot dot create user
with email and password and pass in the
email and password so let's test this
out let's put in the email address put
in the password and let's try and sign
up coming out to a firebase database
just refresh this we see that the user
has been added so now that the user is
signed up let's try and lock the user in
to see if the user is login with that
username and password so again inside
the login user function let's create a
try block and a catch block
now let's come to the tribe lock and
lock the user in so it's a firebase dot
dot dot sign-in with email and password
passing the email and the password this
will return a promise trust so we can
say dot 10 function get the user consult
or log the user so basically that should
return us the users details and we log
these in we should be able to see it in
a console so let's try that let's put in
and show programmer and 3 to gmail.com
put in the password open up the expo
client clear this out and click on login
and there we can see and there we can
see we've got the data back there we've
got the API key we've got the user's
email ID we don't have any other data of
the user yet so that just shows that
this is the user's data that is returned
to us now we can use this data to take
the user to some other page and create
do whatever we want to that data
this is just a basic implementation of
Horror creator sign up in a login method
using firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
