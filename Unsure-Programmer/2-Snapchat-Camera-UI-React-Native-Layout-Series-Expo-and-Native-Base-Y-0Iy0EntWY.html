basic UI of a snapchat application in
this part we'll build the camera UI so
what we want is the moment the user
opens the app it should have the camera
just like the snapchat application so
let's create a new file here say now
root folder will create a new folder
called components and inside that will
create a new file called camera Roach's
that is create a basic class and let's
call it camera component come back to
the apt rjs and here inside where we've
got the camera text let's get rid of
that put in our camera component here
and let's import camera here at the top
as well so it's import camera from go
into our components folder and camera
wrote yes and as we can see we're
getting the text camera component from
this file now we're going to be using
the camera component that expo provides
us see on top let's import certain
things swill import camera and
permissions from expo inside our class
let's set up a state switch the state is
equal to let's call it has camera
permission and set that to null and also
let's set the type to camera dot
Constance dot type dot back this is
basically the back camera which is going
to open up by default next we need to
ask the user for permission to use the
camera that will do inside the component
will mount method so we'll create a
asynchronous component will mount
inside this let's create a constant
called status and we'll store the status
from asking the user for the permission
so we'll say permissions dot ask async
and inside that will say permissions dot
camera in here I missed in equal to next
once the user is granted or denied
permission we have to set that so we'll
say this dot set state and we'll update
the house camera permission depending on
whether the status was granted or denied
so if status is equal equal to grant it
we prepared return true otherwise we'll
return false also I just realized that
I've spelled this wrong this should be
has camera now let's display the camera
so inside the render method let's get
rid of this return here let's store has
camera permission into a constant it's
not all let's check if has camera
permission is equal equal to null that
is the user didn't select allow or deny
the usages exited the box when it came
up will turn an empty view so it's a
return view else it has camera
permission is equal equal to false then
we return text which says no access to
camera otherwise the users allowed the
use of the camera and we should display
the camera so let's put in a view here
inside that we'll put in the camera so
let's give the view of Flex of one
and also give the camera flex of one we
also set the type of camera to the back
camera so if you remember here at the
top in the state we've set that so let's
say this dot state dot type let's save
that and I forgot to return this so
let's put in return here so as an answer
with camera or getting a blue screen
that's because in the app dot jeaious if
you remember we had set these styles dot
slide default in that we basically
adjust to find the content to the center
and the align items are Center with this
background color so let's get rid of
that here and let us give this a flex oh
one so now we got a black screen
basically this is the camera that's
displaying but on the simulator you will
just see a black screen when you test it
on your phone you will get the camera
now let's style the camera screen so in
camera or jeaious we'll start by
importing certain things from NATO base
so we imported the container content
header item icon input in button you
will see we'll be using all of these in
our app and also we need a couple of
icons that are available in the material
icons which are provided by Expo so
let's import those also so let's call
that material community icon and we'll
import that from react native vector
icons these are provided by Expo and
inside that we need the material
community icons so first let's create a
header here so inside the camera
component
let's put in the header we need to make
the header transparent so that the
camera is displayed through it so for
that we'll make the header absolutely
positioned so it's a position:absolute
give it a background color of
transparent position zero from the left
zero from the top and zero from the
right
let's give it a Z index of 100 so that
it's always on top and let's save that
out let us have a look at what we're
trying to achieve so we're trying to
create this header on the top here right
now so native base provides us is the
neat search bar inside the header so
let's say let's put a search bar here
and we'll make it rounded as well now
inside the header what we'll do is we'll
make this snapshot icon and the search
bar in one box and we'll make these two
icons in one box so we put in a view and
we'll put in a flex direction of row so
let's put in a view here let's give it a
flex direction of the row and we'll give
it a flex of four because you want the
icon and the search bar to take up more
space than the other two icons and then
let's put in our icon
so we'll say icon name logo snapchat
let's style it give it a color of white
let's close out the icon so there you
can see we're getting the icon next we
need to put in an input which we'll put
inside an item field again the item
should be transparent so that you can
see through it so it's a
background-color:transparent beside the
item we'll put in an icon this one will
be called iOS search and again style it
to be a color of white
as you can see that the icon is a little
small so let's increase the size font
size of 24 and a font weight of bold
that makes it a little bigger
but they seem to not be aligned for that
let's come to the header and let's give
it a line items property of center that
makes them vertically aligned along with
this icon we need an input let's make
that a self closing tag and here let's
put in a placeholder let's call that
search and let's set the placeholder
text color to white and then we can see
we're getting the search text as well
now let's set up these other two icons
so let's create another view outside
this view again we give this view a Flex
erection of row and a flex of two inside
that let's put in the first icon this is
called iOS flash and let's style that
with a color white and a font weight of
board let us close out the tank so there
we have a flash icon and I'll just copy
this icon for the camera icon let's
rename this to iOS reverse camera and
save that out as you can see that the
icons are very close to each other so
here what we'll do is we put in just a
file content of space around so that
they're nicely spaced and inside the
icon we'll put it an on press the type
of camera so we'd say on press is equal
to here we'd say they store said state
we say type and we use a conditional to
change the type so it's a distraught
state dot type if it's equal equal to
the back camera that is camera dot
constants dot type dot back then change
it over to the front camera
otherwise change to the back camera next
we need to get these icons that are
there at the bottom for that let's
create another view which will be
outside the header so let's say view
give it a flesh direction of row again
will say justify content space between
so that the icons are equally spaced
horizontally let's put in the first icon
see here we're gonna be using the
material icon that we'd imported so it's
a material community icons the name of
the icon is could be message reply and
let's close that out let's style the
icon color again is going to be white
we're just gonna give it a slightly
bigger font size 36 as we can see this
icon is going out on the top left we
want it to be here right at the bottom
so for that what we need to do is we
need to come here to the main camera
view and in this style here what we'll
do is we'll say justify content space
between and as we can see that the icon
has gone here right at the bottom also
to this view let's add a padding here so
we'll say padding horizontal of 10 now
we'll give it a margin bottom of 15 now
let's put the other icons so we're just
gonna need an icon name and this is
gonna be called iOS images and I'll just
paste the styling and the third icon is
again gonna be a material icon so let's
copy that and that one is called Google
Circles community communities so there
you can see we're getting our three
icons but here we need one bigger icon
here which is on top of this one so we
put this middle icon into another view
by default it has a flex direction of
columns will desist I'll is equal to
align items Center and I just put in the
icon that's also a material icon so I'll
just pasted in here and it's gonna be
called circle outline and the font size
is gonna be much bigger of 100 now as
you can see these icons have moved up
with this icon so to fix that what we're
gonna do is we're gonna put in the line
items here and say Flex end so that they
move to the bottom so as you can see
we've got all the icons that we need for
our snapchat app and if you test this
out on your mobile device you'll see
that you press this button and the
camera flips and also right now if we
swipe to the right we can see stories
comes up and we swipe to the opposite
direction we get chat if we swipe down
we get the search screen and we swipe up
we get the memory screen I hope you guys
like this and try this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
