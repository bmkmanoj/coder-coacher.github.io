today's video I'll be showing you how to
create the tinder swipe deck animation
so here in front of us we have the app
open as you can see when you swipe to
the left you'll get that text on the top
indicating that you dislike the image if
you don't swipe enough and let go the
image falls back into place if you swipe
to the right you get the like text at
the top and again if you let go it falls
back to its place if you swipe enough it
will animate out and as you can see the
image behind nicely zooms in and the
opacity of the image also changes so
this is what we're gonna be working on
this should be really fun to build and I
hope you guys like this so let's begin
there's just one thing to keep in mind
over here that the animations of the
simulator might look a little buggy
however if you test them out in your
actual device they will work perfectly
smoothly this has been tested both on
iOS and Android so to begin with in
front of me I have an empty react native
project that I've created with Expo on
top here the first thing I'll do is I'll
import some images these images I
already have in my assets folder you can
use any five images all I've done is
create an array of objects and each
image has an ID and a URI
so let's first set up the UI of how the
image is going to look so in the render
method let's get rid of this view over
here create another view of star equal
to flex of one inside this view will
create a header a Content view and a
footer so the first one is gonna be the
header we just give it a style of a
height of 60 then we'll have a view in
the middle with a style of flex of 1 and
below this we'll have another view with
a height of 60 so this is the header
this is the footer and this is the
content view so here in our content view
is where we'll render our images let's
see how the image is going to look for
that let's first import in dimensions
here from react native and let's get the
height and width of the screen so it's a
constant screen height
is equal to dimensions not get window
dot height similarly we can get the
screen width and we'll also import an
image and animate it from react native
animated is the library that can be
using to animate our view so inside the
content view let's create another view
which is going to be an animated view so
animated dot view lets style that view
give it a height equal to the screen
height minus 120 which is the sum of the
height of the header and footer so that
it comes between them and a width equal
to the screen width inside this view
we'll put in an image let's get the
first image from our users so it's a
user's 0 and get the URI as we can see
the image is not fitting in so let's put
in some styles so you're in a flex of 1
a height of null and a width of null and
we'll also put in resize mode equal to
cover the image tries to fit in nicely
let's put in a padding of 10 here on the
parent so that it spaces out nicely from
the edges and also lets give the image a
border radius of 20 so that's looking
exactly how we want it to look now that
we have i image ready we can move this
into a map method so that we can display
all our images so here let's create a
new method called render users I know we
don't have any users and only have food
images but let's just still call it
render users see here will return users
dot map the first one be item the second
one will be the index and inside this
will put in another return here let's
copy this animated view from here let's
paste it in here and instead of
hard-coding the image let's say item dot
uri and let's call render users here
so now instead of stacking up our images
are displayed one below the other
so let's position the view absolutely so
that the images get stacked so let's say
position:absolute and now we can see i
emitters are stacked above each other
let's get rid of this error here to
prevent that error from coming up we
just need to give each item a key so
just say key is equal to item down ID
because her ID is unique and save there
are also right now our last image which
is a fifth image it's showing up here in
the top instead we want the first image
to be at the top for that all we need to
do is on our map method just type
reverse so if we save and refresh that
we see that we're getting our first
image in the top now it's time to start
animating the image so come here at the
top let's import in pan responder from
react native above render users let's
create component we'll mount inside this
let's say this dot pan responder is
equal to van responder dot create and we
need a couple of methods here the first
one would be on star should set pan
responder to parameters which is the
event and the gesture state set that to
true then the next one is on pan
responder move that is when the user
pans across the screen the same two
methods as a parameters we leave that
empty for now and the last one will be
on pan responder release with the same
two parameters so on star should set pan
responder will be true by default so
that the pan responder becomes active
when the user clicks inside on pan
responder move we will set the gesture
that the user does on to a particular
value which will just create an on pan
responder release will decide whether to
toss the image or to bring it back to
its original position so let's create a
constructor here and as always let's
call super let's create a new value
called this dot position which is going
to be a new animated value so animated
dot value
XY and will also set a state so let's
say this dot state is equal to we'll set
a current index which will be the index
of the card that's showing in front of
us starting with zero in a pan responder
move method will say this dot position
dot set value set the x value to gesture
state dot the DX position and the Y
value to gesture state dot dy this
simply sets the X&amp;amp;Y panned values to
this position object
let's leave the on pan respond release
empty for now and let's attach the pan
responder to our animated view so an
animated view over here reduce the
spread operator to pass it in so they
stopped and responded or panhandlers and
also in all styles we'll pass in our
position so we need to turn this into an
array and what we'll do here is we'll
pass in the transform property and say
this dot position
dot get translate transform so that the
x and y values are translated on to the
x and y axis let's save that and refresh
it and as we can see now we can drag our
image around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
