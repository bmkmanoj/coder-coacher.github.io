video is on react navigation like most
of you know react navigation can be used
to navigate between screens in our react
native app however react navigation
provides us with three navigators to
navigate between our app one is the tab
navigator one is the stack navigator and
one is the draw navigator in this video
I'll show you what is the normal way of
structuring your app using these three
navigators in combination with each
other so here in front of us we have our
first main screen which has two options
one is the login and one is the signup
button if you click on sign up it will
take you to the signup screen clicking
on the login button will obviously take
you to the login screen here once the
user enters the details
I usually click on complete login which
takes the user to a dashboard over here
which not only has a tab navigator at
the bottom but also has a draw navigator
on the top which can be opened by this
button also this draw navigator is
common to all the tabs clicking on the
logout button will take the user back to
the main screen once you have this
strong navigation flow setup you can
build any app on top of this so let's
begin so here in front of me I have an
empty react native project that I
created with expo we'll start by
installing react navigation so open up
the terminal and type NPM install react
navigation but we'll install a
particular version of it that version is
1.0.0 beta 11 I saw some errors with the
latest version coming up allows trying
to record this this is one version I
know that works you could just try the
latest one and it might just work for
you once that's done there are times
when you will get an error which is a
red screen for that just run NPM install
again to get rid of that error and then
just restart your project and you should
be good to go so starting with the first
screen in airports yes we'll first
create a stack navigator so on top here
let's import the stack navigator
this will be the main Navigator of our
app so here we'll say contact navigator
actually let's call it app stack
navigator is equal to a new stack
navigator which will have a first screen
which will be the welcome screen and the
screen that it points to will also be
welcome screen it's easier this way to
just name the screen the same as the
route the next screen is going to be a
login screen which points to the login
screen again and similarly we have a
sign-up screen that points to the
sign-up screen so let's quickly set
these up you'll first create a new
folder called screens and inside that
will create the three files first one is
welcome screen is login screen dot yes
and sign-up screen dot Cheers I'll just
import some boilerplate code here
all it does is returns the name of the
screen I'll post a link in the
description on how to get this
auto-generated snippet for you once
these these feelings are created come
back to the apt or chairs and let's
import them in and here we're just gonna
have to name this login screen for a
typo so now our app stack Navigator is
set up we want this to be our root
navigator so here let's get rid off this
view and let's pass in the app stack
navigator here this will make the
welcome screen the first screen there is
here so let's come to the welcome screen
the welcome screen is where we'll have
the login and sign up buttons so let's
just import button here from the top get
rid of this text and put in the button
the first one will be the login button
and the second one will be the signup
button and they have to have a on press
on it
this will point to the login screen and
this will point to the sign-up screen on
our welcome screen we obviously don't
want a header so let's get rid of that
header by saying static navigation
options is equal to header of none there
we see our header is gone let's click on
the login button it takes us to the
login screen here we do want to have a
header so that the user can click back
and go back similarly on the signup
screen we'll also have the header which
allows the user to go back
so in our login screen now let's put in
another button which takes us to our
dashboard so come to the login screen
and here let's important button in again
I'll just copy this one I will say
complete login and as of now we don't
have that screen setup so it doesn't
know where to go so here from the login
screen we want the user to go to the
screen which has the tab navigators and
the draw navigator so that means we need
to have a draw navigator as one of our
screens of our stack navigator so let's
create the drawn a vagator inside our
screens folder let's create a new file
call that draw navigator
so let's import in some boilerplate code
as always yeah let's call this app draw
navigator that's important draw
navigator here
also let's get rid of this class as we
don't need it let's create a Const app
draw navigator which is equal to a new
draw navigator with the first screen
called homescreen and it will point to
the homescreen so let's create this file
inside screens a screed homescreen on
shares and let's import homescreen
inside our draw navigator simple
homescreen from home screen now in app
dot J's let's pass in the draw navigator
as one of our screens of our stack
navigator
so it's import raw Navigator from
screams draw navigator and here let's
put in draw navigator also now inside
our login screen we know where to go so
let's change login screen to draw
navigator now let's test this out
clicking on login complete login takes
us to the home screen so though our
navigation is working there are a few
bugs we need to fix firstly swiping
should only bring up the draw navigator
and not take the user back to the
previous screen so for that in our main
stack navigator let's put in some
navigation options put in a comma here
and say navigation options we will set
gestures enabled to false
that'll make sure that at least when
were in our draw navigator I'll swipe
only brings up our draw navigator and
not the previous screen also this draw
navigator should not get hidden below
this tab navigator on the top and this
back button should change to a menu
button we also need to get tabs here at
the bottom so flap what we'll do is
inside our draw navigator let's import
in another stack navigator let's create
that stack navigator here let's call it
in a stack navigator be a new stack
navigator that will point to our tab
navigator
and the screen that we pointed to is a
home screen tab navigator which we are
yet to create so basically we have a
main stack navigator which has a draw
navigator inside it which again has a
stack navigator inside it the reason for
having another stack navigator inside it
is so that this header menu is local to
that particular tab navigator and does
not come above this draw navigator so
let's create this home screen tab
navigator
so our screens will create home screen
tab navigator dot yes so let us import
the boilerplate code call this home
screen damn navigator let's report the
time navigator here so we'll say import
tab navigator from react navigation
let's get rid of this classroom here and
say Const home screen time navigator is
equal to new tab navigator so let's say
screen one points to a screen name
screen one let's give it some navigation
options so that it has a tab icon and a
tab label so it's a tab bar label is
equal to feed and tap our icon
is equal to Ayane Khan's name MD compass
size of 24 close that out let's import
Ayane cons here so let's say import
Ayane cons from yeah native vector icons
/ Ayane cons and similarly we create
screen to which I'm just gonna duplicate
here which points to screen screen - and
also this should not be in courts
so let's create these two screens so
inside a screens folder let's create a
tab navigator folder and inside that
let's put in screen one ojs import some
boilerplate code which has screen 1 and
similarly let's create screen 2 dot yes
call it screen 2 so here if you have a
look we have a folder called tab
navigator inside which we have two
screen screen 1 &amp;amp; 2 let's import these
screens in the home screen tab navigator
let's say import screen one from that
navigator slash screen 1 and import
screen 2 from tab navigator slash skin
do let's import to Home screen tap
navigator inside of draw navigator so
here let's import home screen time
navigator from home screen time
navigator and also now our home screen
instead of pointing directly to the home
screen should point to this in a stack
navigator which has the home screen tab
navigator so here let's put it in a
stack navigator save that out now if you
click on the login button complete login
we see we have our two tabs screen one
in screen 2 however we are not seeing
the icons here so let's just fix that in
our home screen tab navigator I realized
I put these brackets wrong instead of
curly brackets that should be rounded
brackets
now if we save that there we see our two
icons are showing up now as you can see
here we have two headers over here so
let's get rid of the top header come to
the apt ah yes
inside this where we have the draw
navigator let's put in some navigation
options here so it's a header of none
now we see we're only seeing one header
at the top and we slide from the left we
get the draw navigator now what we want
to do is we want to display an icon here
at the top which we can click to open
the draw navigator for that let's come
to a home screen damn navigator as of
now I did exporting the default home
screen damn navigator directly but
instead of this we'll put this into a
class so it's a export default class app
damn navigator which extends component
beside this put in a regular render
method which has a return inside it and
that return is going to pass in the home
screen time navigator instead of default
exporting this let's change this to a
constant and save this out and
everything should still look the same
next we'll come here and add some static
navigation options with which we'll
configure our header button so it's a
equal to pass in this navigation prop
and then return head or left pass in a
view with a style padding of 10 and then
we'll pass in an icon inside which will
be Ayane Khan's name is gonna be MD menu
on press will be navigation not navigate
drawn open and let's close that out as
you can see I had already imported ionic
ons here at the top you can just do that
and then we can test this out they were
seeing the icon it doesn't look the best
let's increase this size and then we
have icon if we click on it we see our
draw navigator opening up now that we
are passing this homescreen tab
navigator as a view here it's children
will not be aware of the fact that it's
a part of our navigation system and this
store props nor navigation will not be
available to it react navigation advises
us to connect this to their router but I
just found that a little too complicated
what we can do instead is just use
screen props so what we'll do is we'll
say screen props is equal to collar prop
navigation and set that to this dot
props dot navigation now inside our
screen suppose we go to screen one we
can put in a button here will say button
title is equal to let's call that logout
I will say on press is equal to we can't
use this store props or navigation but
we can use this dot props dot screen
props not navigation dot navigate and
then go to suppose the welcome screen
now let's test this out and then we can
see you are back on the welcome screen I
know this has been a slightly long video
but I hope it has covered the main ways
of using these navigators together
though my recommendation will be that in
a normal app you usually need a stack
navigator with either the draw navigator
or the tab navigator it's rare that you
would want to use both of them but in
case you do this is how you can do it
