navigation bar and we'd also added the
animations to go between tabs now it's
time to create the component which is
going to be the feed component of fire
so in an Instagram app in front you have
images that come here and you can scroll
through them so let's build that what
we'll do is we'll create a new component
first let's call that a card component
but this is going to look like a card
and we've created that inside our
components folder so let's pull in some
boilerplate code and let us import that
into our home tab symport card component
from card component and let's display it
over here by removing the view we'll put
in a container side that we'll put in a
Content which is a scroll view inside
that we'll put in our card component
let's import these two items here first
so that's importing the container and
the content
so as we can see our card component is
getting imported here also let's do one
thing here let's get rid of these a line
item Center and justify content and put
in a background color here of white and
add this style here to the container and
as we can see our background is become
white over there now let's head back to
our card component and let's import some
things we're going to be needing first
from me to base so we need the card the
card item thumbnail body left right
button and icon from native base you'll
understand what they do once we use them
so here inside the return get rid of the
view and let's put in our card inside
the card we'll have a car item inside
that will have a left component which
will have a thumbnail the source of
which will point to my profile picture
I already saw that into my assets folder
you can use any picture that you like
and then we'll put in my name inside a
body tag which is gonna be
and we'll use this component called note
inside text which is going to be the
date so I'm just hard-coding this in
right now so that we can complete the UI
so there you can see we've got the image
we've got the name and we've got the
date so the card in the card item
basically give us this whole box that's
outside and left ensures that we have
the image to the left thumbnail makes
sure that the image does not exceed the
size that we required to be and body is
also making sure that we have the text
to the right side of the image this
saves you a lot of time that you don't
have to setup the Styles yourself next
we put in another card item here inside
that we'll put in an image which should
be the source of the main image that's
put in so we'll say require and just put
in the first one that I have there and
here we're gonna have to put a style to
the image so I'm just gonna give it a
height of 200 we set a width to null and
we set Flex to 1 this will make sure
that it stretches exactly to this size
of the phone while maintaining a height
of 200 and we have an imported image so
that's important also here the card item
has another property which is going to
be called card body and yes the
commercial peda as well refreshing the
app again so you can see you've got the
image nicely placed in the middle here
now below the image we need the icons so
let's add them in here we'll put in
another card item inside that we'll put
in another left and we'll make buttons
here the property of transparent inside
the buttons we'll put in the icon the
first one is gonna be called iOS heart
outline I will give it a color of black
so since we need three icons let's just
copy these in so we'll make two copies
of this I'm gonna make this icon iOS
chat bubbles outline and the last one is
going to be called iOS send out line
seems to be taking up too much space so
let's put another style here and give
them a height of 45 that's much better
also it show how many likes are there on
the image so let's put that in below
this for another card item now you're
used to it so we'll put in a text here
inside that we'll just put in one zero
one likes I will style this to have a
height of 20 so there you see we're
getting the likes and the last thing is
the description that the user puts in on
the comment that the user puts in so
let's put it in our last card item put
in a body and then we need a text we
will insert some random text let's save
that out so there we have the text but
usually the text also has the name of
the person putting it in so Varun should
be shown here again so I put another
text inside this the ACK native allows
us to nest text fields how's his style
give it a font weight of save our 900 so
that it looks quite thick and the text
inside it will be my name in small caps
also they'll just put in a small space
so that you can see it looks like an
actual Instagram post so since we want
to reuse this even for the UI let's just
make some changes here we'll come here
the render method will create a constant
called images which will store all my
images here usually we'll get them from
the database let's duplicate this so
that's how I mean my images in my assets
folder and now what we'll do is we'll
pass in props over here instead of
actually putting the Imogen since tight
sauce will get rid of require and we put
in the images array inside that in the
props will pass in the number of the
image so it's a prop start image source
I'll show you our set that up and also
what we'll do is we get through the
likes here will pass the likes in from
props so let's save that we should get
error as of now and back in the home tab
inside the card component I'll pass in
the image so I'll say image source is
equal to 1 and likes is equal to 1 0 1
for the first image this is duplicate
this put an image source to image source
3 and let us change up the likes once we
save that out we should see I image is
there and I made a very basic mistake
over here inside the card component over
here we have to also require the image
and not only provide the path so I'll
just fix that quickly
now if you save that out we'll get an
error and there we have it finally I
Instagram is working and if we can
scroll we can actually see that it's
scroll just like that obviously the
performance is better on an actual
device than the simulator so I hope you
guys enjoyed this video I'll be building
a lot more you is if there are any that
you want me to build please let me know
I'd be more than happy to do that
