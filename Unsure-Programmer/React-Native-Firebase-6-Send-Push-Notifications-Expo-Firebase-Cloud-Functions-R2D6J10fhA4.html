Expo along with firebase to send push
notifications to our react native app to
send push notifications need to have
three things a client interface which is
our app a server where we can store the
user's data in our database and decide
which user to send the push notification
to and thirdly we need to have another
server which helps us send the push
notifications so for the server we're
gonna be using the firebase real-time
database along with cloud functions the
database is where we're going to be
storing the users token and the cloud
function is where we're going to be
deciding who to send the notification to
and for sending the push notifications
we're going to be using expose own
server to send the notification that's
the benefit of using X for that it
allows us to use its server to send
notifications without having to spin up
your own server so we're gonna be
building upon us Y to the list project
that we had created in the last video
the link for it is in the description so
here I have the project in front of me
the only change that I've made is I
change the name of the placeholder from
ad name to add note which is going to
make this app look like a note-taking
app in which users add notes and
everyone else will log into this app
we'll get push notifications for a new
note
so let's first import the permissions
and notifications from expoe come here
to the top next let's create a method
which will help us register the users
token in our firebase database so let's
call that method register for push
notifications in sync so basically the
aim of creating this function is to show
the user a pop-up to allow for push
notifications if the user allows it
store the token in the users database so
that we can retrieve it later come into
the expo Docs this is done for us I'll
just copy this code and walk you through
it
so the first thing it does is it uses
permissions to check what the current
status of the permissions is if the
existing status is not granted it'll
show pop up to the user on iOS devices
to allow for the notifications in case
of Android devices these permissions are
set up during the app install and may
not work during testing with expo next
if the user denies the permission for
push notifications the function will
just end if the user allows the
permission for the push notifications it
will get the token from the expo server
and store it into a constant call token
then all we need to do is we need to
post the token to our back-end server
from where we can retrieve it to send
push notifications for that we'll use
fire this so normally it'd be nice to
have a login flow created for us in
which the user enters an email or
password and logs in and then comes to
the screen where the user will be adding
the notes for now I've already created
two users in a firebase authentication
system and save their details in our
firebase database you can learn how to
create this authentication system in one
of my previous videos which the link for
which is available in the description so
once the user allows the application to
send push notifications will save the
export Oken here under the user's UID so
it'd be nice to have a login flow in
which you can log to use in and then go
to the push notification screen but here
we'll just lock the using using coal so
coming here to the top inside a
component in Mount it's a firebase dot
earth dot sign in with email and
password and we'll pass in the email and
password of the user this is the user
that I've created and then we say dot
then we'll get the user back from the
database and then we will call register
for push notifications async will also
pass in the user to this method and here
in this method we'll update it to take a
parameter called user so that the
current user is passed
coming here below now what I need to do
is we need to update the users data to
store the x-bow token on it so we freed
a variable called updates will save our
updates an empty object and then we'll
say updates point to the node that we
want to update the token at which is
export Oken and set the token there next
we call firebase tour database dot ref
go into the node of users dot child and
use the user parameter that we had
passed to extract the UID of the user
and their update the updates so this
will update the export ocol in the user
database when the user logs in but for
this we have to run this app on an
actual device and I can see there are
some typos here this should be updates
and this should be users and this should
be UID so now that we have all that
ready we can test this out on the phone
and see if it works
so here we have the phone in front of us
let's test the app out and let's scan
the QR code and then we see we get an
alert which says export would like to
send notifications easily gonna allow
and then we have to have in front of us
so data we should have been updated now
so let's cross-check that there you can
see the export oaken has been added to
the particular user now the last thing
that we need to do is we need to set up
a cloud function to be able to detect
when a new note is added and when the
note is added it will send a push
notification to the users that have
subscribed to the push notifications
open up the terminal in our project
folder we'll run firebase in it after
that we'll come down here to functions
and press base part is selected
see that javascript is a type of
language and you want to install the
dependencies would be yes once the
installation is complete if we come here
we will see we have a functions folder
created for us and inside that we have
an index for Jas there's one more
dependency that we'll install before we
start writing our function this
dependency will be installed inside the
functions folder it's called node fetch
it basically helps us make HTTP requests
so inside our terminal we'll go into the
functions folder and there we'll run npm
install node fetch now that that's also
installed we can start writing a
function right var fetch is equal to
require and will require the node fetch
module that we just installed we get rid
of this commented code here then we'll
say constant admin is equal to require
firebase admin this dependency was
installed automatically along with five
is Cloud functions and then we'll
initialize the app so I image to create
a function that will detect when an
entry is made into the contacts node if
our database and then send a
notification to all the users that are
that have subscribed to the push
notifications telling them that a new
node was added so the method that will
be creating would be called send push
notification and we call functions nor
database dot ref contacts ID check for a
on create event and get the event back
so basically this checks when an entry
is made under the contacts node run this
function what we'll do is using the
event we get the root of the database
by saying event don't date our raft on
route and we'll just create an empty
area here this array will store all the
push notifications that we create next
week say root rot child users dot once
value to get all our users from our
database
that way we'll get the snapshot for
database will loop over the snapshot and
get a child snapshot from it that is
once we've got the users we loop over
them and each individual user will be
your child snapshot then we'll extract
the token from them so we child snapshot
dot Val dog export token trying to
extract the export open from here next
we check if the token exists and if it
does we create the notification so it's
a messages stored push to I will pass in
the export orchid we want to send the
notification to this particularly export
token and we put in a body say new note
on it but let me show you this code here
since this is an asynchronous request we
are unsure of when this completes we
need to get this array and then send the
push notification to it so the best way
to do that would be to use promises
so here the top will return the main
promise by putting a return here and
inside here what we'll do is we'll say
return promise start all with the
messages so we get another dot then here
because we're returning a promise and
then work on the messages so you say
fetch using the node fetch that we had
installed then here we need to copy in
the expo URL that the expo documentation
provides us so if you come into the
documentation and go into the push
notification section we can copy out
this URL from here and paste it in here
next when you set up some properties
here
the first one will be method which will
be of type post headers overpass in
except which will be of type application
or JSON and content type which will also
be application or JSON / JSON and lastly
we need to put in the body of the push
notification which would have to be in
text form but here on top we had created
a JSON object so we need to convert that
into string before we send it out so
you'll say json dot stringify and pass
in the messages that's all we need to do
to set up our function we just need to
upload this function to our firebase
console before we can test this out so
open up the terminal go into your
project folder and run firebase deploy
so there a function has been deployed to
a server and now is the moment of truth
trying to test out a push notification
just a small node I'd like to make over
here is that firebase does not allow you
to use cloud functions with an external
API in the free plan you must sign up
for either a fixed plan or the blaze
plan which is a pay-as-you-go plan I've
noticed that even if you take a glazed
plan for testing purposes you won't be
charged anything so it's worth giving it
a try and my firebase console open up
what we'll do is we'll add a new node
under the contacts node so I'll say ID
of one and give it a name of upload
video because I really need to upload
this video now and if we click on add we
should get the notification so that's
added to our database and bam we get the
push notification on our phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
