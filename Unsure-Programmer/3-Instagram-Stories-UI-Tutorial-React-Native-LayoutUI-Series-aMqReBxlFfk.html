to create the stories header in
Instagram app as you can see you are
getting the thumbnails of the people
who've published stories and we can
scroll through this to see all the
stories that are available to us so
let's begin
so let's start from where we left off we
have a content inside which we display
our card component here inside the
content we'll create a header so that'll
be a view inside that we will put in a
text which has stories and we put in
another text it says watch all so that
doesn't look really nice that style that
a little so firstly we'll give a height
to our header so we'll give it a height
of 100 inside that what we do is we'll
put these two texts inside another view
I will style this view with a flex of
one flex direction of RO what we say is
justified content space between and see
if that out as you can see that looks
better we want the stories in the left
and the water all button on the right
what we also do is we will give this an
online items of center and we'll give it
a padding horizontal so that it's a
little away from the corners of cell so
that it's taking up the two corners but
it's taking up the whole space here so
what we'll do is we'll put in another
view here and we'll give it a style
which will be a flex as well but we
wanted to take more space than the first
one so we'll say a flex of three so you
can assume that's a ratio about one is
three so there you see the text has
moved up to the top C on the empty space
here we put in a scroll view which
allows us to scroll horizontally so
let's import the scroll view in first
come here and which is called view here
we need to display thumbnail of the user
so native miss provides us with need
component called thumbnail let's import
that in come down here and type
thumbnail and we'll pass in the source
so I've already stored thumbnails in a
folder the stories header thumbnails and
let's close that out so now we see we're
getting a thumbnail let's start that up
a little bit so if this tile is equal to
margin or azan to a 5 border color of
pink the border width of 2 save that out
and as you can see we've got a border
there and it's also got a margin from
the left let's just copy this thumbnail
a couple of times and as you can see
it's not exactly displaying as it should
so let's just make some changes to uh
scroll view let's put in some styles
here and some properties the first
property that we're looking at is
horizontal which is equal to true this
makes the scroll view scroll
horizontally next we'd say shows
horizontal indicator equal to false this
makes sure that when you scroll you
don't see the indicator that when you're
scoring right now you'll see me an
indicator on the side which will not
display let's first see if this are in
see how that looks and it seems as
spelled horizontal wrong here and as you
can see horizontally it's working
correctly
next let's just add some styles here so
it's a content container style and
inside that we'll say a line items of
center and we'll put in a padding start
of five and a padding end of five as
well to space out the first in the last
element and we save that out we see the
images come down a little so all do is
quickly I'll change up these images and
add a few more images
so there you can see we've got a few
other images and if we scroll this right
now we should see it's crawling so one
last thing I want to do over here is
make the stories and the water on takes
a little bold and put in a play button
over here so let's do that come into the
top what we'll do is we'll put this
particular text into another view and
inside this we will put in an icon so
its icon name we put in the MD play icon
we see the icon is huge and it's not
even fitting in so let's style the icon
give it a font size of 14 we also need
to star the parent view so it says style
flex Direction change that row and we'll
say a line items of center so there we
see the icon is displaying correctly
let's just make the text a little ball
now this will say style and we just use
font weight to make the text bold and
I'll just copy that into the other text
so there you can see it looks very
similar to the stories header in a
natural Instagram app obviously this
border in the app is actually a gradient
here we've just used one color for
simplicity so this is another short
video I hope you guys like this and try
this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
