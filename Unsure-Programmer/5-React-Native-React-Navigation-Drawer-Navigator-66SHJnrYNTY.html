navigator to our application you already
have a stack navigator if we go to the
home screen the home screen has a tab
navigator but usually most apps have a
main level or a root level draw
navigator which slides out from the side
so let's just add that let's come to the
app gorgeous here let's import the draw
navigator that's also imported from the
AG navigation coming down here we make
our route level component as the draw
navigator have drawn our Gator is equal
to draw navigator so what we can do is
the screens are gonna remain the same so
let's just copy the screens from here
and paste them in here comment out the
app navigator and here let's add app
draw Nevada let's add refresh as you can
see the header is gone now but if you
slidin from the left side we already
have a drawer over there you click on
the homescreen it takes us to the home
screen by this text is missing so let's
fix that now come to the login screen
now the login screen will become a stack
navigator which has the home screen
inside so let's say let's call that
login screen stack navigator and it
should be of type stack navigator here
this is importing this wrong so let us
import it will be import stack navigator
from the add navigation like we did
earlier you know the first screen would
be the login screen
and the second screen would be the home
screen
you know what we'll have to do is we'll
have to import the home screen and
so let's export the login screen stack
Nevada there it is we have the home
screen we click to the home screen
button it takes us to the home screen
and notifications tabs here coming back
we're back to the home screen and if we
just swipe in from the left we have the
drawer navigator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
