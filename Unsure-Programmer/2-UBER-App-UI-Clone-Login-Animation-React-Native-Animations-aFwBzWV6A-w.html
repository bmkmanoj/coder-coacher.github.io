of the application in this part let's
start with the animation the first thing
we'll do is we'll animate this uber logo
and this bottom layout when the app
first opens up
so this zooms in and this slides up
nicely for that we'll use the react
native animatable library that we're
installed so let's import that in here
so the way we imported is import all as
animatable from react native animatable
next we need to change up our fuse that
we want to animate so the view we're
looking to animate here is the one which
has the uber text in it so we need to
rename that and animatable view so the
way that's done is it's animatable dot
view is what we want to make it and then
we can add the animation to it so you
can see animation is equal to zoom in
iteration count is equal to one because
we only wanted to happen once let's save
that and as we can see that animation is
working similarly let's add an animation
to this bottom layout so here let's
change this view that holds the complete
bottom layout to an animatable view
and at this the animation that we lad is
sliding up and again alteration count is
it going to be one as you can see the
slide in animation and the zoomin
animation are working like we expect now
it's time to start animating the
individual elements a first man
animation is when we click here on this
text input we want this layout to
increase and take up the whole screen so
the first thing we want to do is we want
to disable this text input
so let's come down here in the view that
contains the text input and this text
will put in a property called pointer
events and set that none now if you
click here you can notice that only the
touchable opacity is working next let's
come here to the view which has a height
of 150 change this to an animated dot
view this is different from the
animatable view animated dot view is
provided to us by react native so we
come down here rename this view to an
animated dot view and on top here make
sure that we have imported animated
coming onto a touchable opacity that we
had created to surround the text input
we'll put in our own press method here
so we'll say on press is equal to it
should call a method called increase
height of login we had to create this
method so that's coming out of the top
and create this method increase height
of login and we'll do nothing here as of
now let's create a component we'll mount
inside this is where we will set the
default values of our particular layout
the first thing you want is this dot
login height I will set that a new
animated dot value of 150 as a default
value here where we had set the height
as 150 we'll change this to this door to
login height if we refresh that we see
that the height remains the same now we
can alter this value and animate the
height of the layout so come to the
increase height of layout method and
let's add our first animation method
so we'll say animated dot timing passing
what we want to animate which is this
dot login
and here we want to animate it to a two
value which should be the height of the
screen which we have to set up and we
have to give a duration as well which is
gonna be 500 milliseconds so for the
high come here to the top and import
something known as dimensions from react
native what we do is we create a
constant called screen height which is
gonna be equal to dimensions got cat
window dot height this will bring us the
height of the screen and we set that
here to the two value it's important to
start the animation now if we refresh
this and test this out when we click on
this we see that the height increases
obviously everything else doesn't look
as nice we're going to fix that shortly
so when the height of this view is
getting animated to the screen height we
also want to animate the get moving with
ruber text you want to make sure that
animation works in sync with the
increasing height animation so for that
we'll use the interpolate method
available to us in react native so let's
set up some values that we will animate
the first would be the header text
opacity for that we say they store login
height dot interpolate we start with an
input range I'll walk you through this
once I write this the beginning value
will be 150 and the ending value will be
the screen height and the output range
which will start from 1 and end at 0
what this means is when this height is
150 we want the opacity to be 1 and when
the height animates to the screen height
which is to the top we want the opacity
to change to 0 similarly we'll set up
other values like margin top so for that
let us copy this here and just rename
this to margin top we want the margin
top of the get moving with uber texture
change from 25 to 100 during the
animation now let's replace the
hard-coded values with these values so
coming down here let's change the
opacity to header text opacity and let's
change the margin top to margin top and
let's refresh this and test this out and
as always change the view to an animated
view so any of you wanna animate it must
be an animated view
today we see it looks just like it was
with the hard-coded values let's animate
this now and as we can see a header text
opacity has changed and it has
disappeared from the top now let's
create the header back arrow over here
so that's gonna be absolutely positioned
so we'll just put it on the top inside
of you we'll make it an animated dot
view because we want to try animate and
we give it some styles so it's a style
is equal to position of absolute height
of 60 and a width of 60 top of 60 and a
left of 25 with a set index of 100 so
that stays on the top and the opacity
that will give it is header back arrow
opacity we have to create this value and
inside the view we'll put in a touchable
opacity which is an icon inside it of
type MD arrow back and a color of black
let's import icon from native base here
this icon has to be in brackets and here
let's put in an on press method as well
which we will create later let's call
that decrease height of login let's
create this header back arrow value now
so here lets us copy margin top and
let's change this to header back arrow
opacity and we want the output range to
be 0 to 1 because first we don't want it
to be displayed and when the height
increases we won't change it to 1 let's
save that refresh this so as we can see
right now we're not seeing any back
arrow here on the left when we tap this
we see that that back arrow appears now
let's set up the method that decreases
the height so you already named the
method let's just write it here it's a
decrease height of login in order to do
is it is just do the opposite of this so
let us copy this
and changes the value to 150 in a
duration of 500 seconds let's save that
and refresh this now if you test this
out we'll see that the header back arrow
appears nicely when we press the header
back arrow it disappears with the get
moving with lewbert X coming back to
prevent this video from getting too long
I'll just stop this here in the next
video we'll finish up this animation to
show the keyboard moving up when we
click on this with a button that comes
on the right along with this text move
into the top and this text changing to a
mobile number till then you guys can try
this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
