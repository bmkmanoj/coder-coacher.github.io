the profile page so we had one main view
which was the stop view let's create
another view below that and now this we
will have two views inside it the first
one will be for these buttons and the
next one will be here for the images so
let's create the first view
let's give it a flex direction of row
let's add the icons in here
so they'll all be buttons so let's start
with the first button we'll have an icon
inside it first one will be called
iOS apps outline let's make the button
transparent let us copy this button so
we need four buttons the second one is
iOS list outline the third one will be
iOS people and the last one will be iOS
bookmark so as you can see this third
icon is not the same as this browse
unable to find the similar icon next let
us add some justify content here this
space this is around correctly so
justify content space around there we
see it's nicely spread out and we'll
just put a border top to this soap our
top with the one and
border-top-color:transparent we see
nothing gets highlighted that's because
we haven't set a state for the button so
let's set a state here let's create a
constructor
and let's set up the state call it
active index and let's set it by default
to zero so let's add an on press on the
buttons will say on press is equal to
they start segment clicked and we pass
in the index of the particular button
and also we can use the active prop to
indicate which button is active they
start state on active index if it's
equal to zero then that means this
button is active also we'll style the
icon when the button is active so let's
put in a style here with the conditional
so this style is equal to put an area
inside that you will say this dot state
dot active index if it's equal equal to
zero then don't do anything it will be
highlighted blue by default otherwise
give it a color of gray now let's set
the segment click method so it's a
segment clicked pass an index here and
all this method will do is set the state
update the active index to the selected
index now what I'll do is I'll just copy
all these things from this button into
the other buttons so just to save time
I've copied everything in and I've just
updated the counts here made this one
for the second button two for the third
button and three for the fourth button
so here you can see it's showing by
default that the first button is
selected and the others are dimmed gray
if we click the second button the second
one becomes active and if you click the
third one the third one becomes active
now depending on which button is clicked
we want to show some data here so come
here below this view we'll put in a
method here which says this dot
intersection
let's create this method here so it's a
render section this method will check
for which index is active and display
the data so we'll say if this dot state
dot active index is equal equal to zero
there should be if we'll return a view
it should have a text inside it saying
this is the first section so as you can
see it shows this is the first section
if you click on the second one nothing
is shown so what we want to do is we
want to show the images there should be
in boxes like this so I'll just import
some images in here so I just created a
variable images and inside that array I
put in the images these images are there
in my assets folder now inside that
under section method we'll just add some
props to our view switch this style is
equal to Flex direction of row since you
want the images to display side by side
and we put a flex rap to it which is rap
so that when the image overflows it is
wrapped into the next line instead of
going out also to keep our code clean we
call another method here which is this
store render section one and inside that
method we will process I amateurs let's
create a method render section one
inside render section one will basically
use a map method to map over you to the
images and return a view so it's a
return images dot map beside that will
pass the first parameter is the image
second one is the index and for each
image will return a view
each of you must have a key and the key
will keep it as the index now I a mr. I
have three images per row so one image
must be 1/3 of the width of the device
so let's get the width of the device for
that let's import dimensions over here
from react native and let us draw the
dimensions in two variables width and
height equal to the dimensions not get
window so here we want each of you to be
equal to one third the width so it's a
style is equal to make it an array
inside this we first set the width it
should be equal to the width of the
device divided by three also since we
want the image to be a square we'll set
the height equal to the same that is
width divided by three so let's save
that out and pass in the image now so
we'll say image style the image what we
need to do is give the image a flex of
one and set the width to undefined and
the height one defined this will make
sure that it takes up all the space
that's available to it also let's pass
in the image which will be source and
pass in the image there which we get
from here so may have to refresh this to
see it and that we see we're getting all
our images however we're not getting
this nice border that we get in between
so let's fix that for that we'll use the
modulus function so here we'll say if
the index mod 3 is not equal to equal to
0 then set the padding left to 2
otherwise set padding left to 0
so these are basically numbered as 0 1 2
3 4 5 so 0 mod 3 will give us 0 so this
will get no padding 1 mod 3 will not be
0 and we get a left padding 2 mod 3 will
not be 0 as well so we'll get a left
padding so basically these two columns
will always give not equal to 0 and we
get padding to the left from both these
columns whereas the first column will
always give 0 and we will not get a
padding to the left so let's save it and
try it out as you can see we've got a
left padding on the two columns for the
bottom let's just put in a margin bottom
of 2 and there we can see we're getting
a neat margin at the model so first I
have a set up but if we click on the
second tab we get no data to come back
at the first one i image a show-up
so let's just set up another tab so in
our render section method we put an else
if statement so it's a else if this dot
state are active index is equal equal to
1 then return we created a card
component earlier which displays the
post
so we'll say card component will pass in
the props for it which is image source
is equal to 1 and likes we'll just put
in a flat hundred we'll just copy this
two more times change the image source
to 2 &amp;amp; 3 and let's also import the car
component so say import card component
from card component if we save that out
and refresh it we see other we need to
put in a view here we can't put the
components like that so you have to put
them inside of you and save that and
refresh it again and if we go to the
second tab there we see we're getting
all our posts click on the first one you
get the first tab again so that's about
it for this profile tab I hope you guys
