display this data in an application so
what we do is once you've got the data
we'll check if the data exists and then
we'll set the state accordingly
we'll set the beer data state equal to
the data and also we set another flag
which is beer found then set that to
true we declare the beer found property
on the state as well and we'll initially
set it to false also Axios gives us a
cache method in case as an error so if
there's an error that means we probably
didn't get the beer back what we do is
we'll set the beer found state to false
next we need to display the beer data in
our content over here
so inside content what we'll do is we
got a method called render content this
method will check if the data was
actually found if the beer was found and
then show the data accordingly so it's a
blend of content we will check if this
that state dot pure data is found then
what to do is you return a particular
view the text saying
this dot state dot be audited or named
else just alert saying we are not found
so let's test that out
we search for Corona and as you can see
we get the name of the bear here what
will be nicer is if we can move this out
into another component of its own so
let's do that let's copy this and over
here let's put a component called search
body let's create the search body fan so
inside search create a new file call it
search body no js' we'll go into search
body import a boilerplate code call it
search body and here is where we will
place the data though we do not have
access to the state inside the component
we'll have to use props to get the data
and we have to pass the props from our
parent element so you can say bear data
this dot state or bear data and pass it
down to the child and also we have to
import search body here at the top
so let's toss that out again and there
you can see that the beer is found and
the data is shown but right now there's
an arrow that will chase if we search
for a beer that does not exist we should
get an error which says we are not found
as you can see we're not getting that
error here that's because instead of
this dot state dot beer data we should
actually be checking for this dot state
dot pure fun even because even when beer
data is an empty object it passes this
as true and this is what runs instead of
this section of the code running
whereas this dot state dot beer found
will return a boolean to us either a
true or a false and the correct block
will run let's see if this and try this
out so we entered a beer that does not
exist you open up the console as you can
see we're getting beer not found the
reason is printing on multiple times is
because the state is being monitored and
every time the state changes it tries to
test this condition whenever the student
condition comes false this part of the
code is run now all we need to do is
format the data that were displaying so
come to the search body here let's
import certain components from native
base and what we need is a list item
along with the content then here what we
can do is
and we'll put in a list item inside that
let's tie them at the property of item
divider
and we can get rid of this view from
here and along with that we'll put in
another list item so the item divider
will act like a heading say on top
clutches I had the first one let's call
that name and here I'll just paste this
in here it's basically we're data dot
name and you give us an arrow right now
because we haven't stored the props
create a variable called bo data and
store the props into that that's quickly
test this out and they were getting the
name along with the name of the pair
surprising me in the latest version of
knitted paste there's this bug that's
coming in which is not giving us the
correct margin from the left so there's
a quick and dirty fix for that and that
is just wrap this into a list first and
style it as a background color of white
and that's looking nice now so instead
of just entering all the data and I'm
just going to copy the data in and walk
you through it
so there are pasted in the data what
we'll do is we'll use the default button
from native base because we don't want
much styling sorry from react native
because we don't want much styling let's
test that out now and there you can see
we're getting the name name is a beer
the category the description the rating
which is all just getting the data from
the API and extracting it so on top here
if you have a look the list item style
equal to flex Direction row and justify
content space between is basically being
used to keep the name of the beer to the
left and the favorites button to the
right so there are two views inside the
first one
the name of the beer the other view is
the button next we have the category
which is beer dated or style or category
named then we have the description which
is beer dated or description then we
have the reading which is bearded or not
EB v then we check if the beer is
organic or not so as you can see it's
checking a beer data is organic is equal
equal to yes only then show yes
otherwise say no and if it oh it also
checks if the beer data description is
available only then show the description
otherwise show no info also what's
missing is an image of the beer and this
add to favorites function this add to
favorites function is something I'll do
in the last part of the series you guys
can also try it out if you guys have an
idea of how to do it let us add the
image to end this video so I'll just
copy that in it's a list item of type
item divider the style is flex direction
we've taken it as a row justify content
is Center so that we can Center the
image that is put inside for that we
need to also import image into react
native so let's do that once that's
imported we're getting the image from
this part of the data of the API so
let's check what that data is if we go
into it so if you look in here they're
under labels we have icon large and
medium what we're using is large what
you have to keep in mind is when you're
using a remote image it is mandatory for
you to set the height and width of the
image yourself so there we have it a
nice and simple app we complete it is
react native in less than about 40
minutes some little changes can be made
right now make it look a little better
and add this favorites button which will
complete in the last video I hope you
