to update the about field on the me tab
for the particular logged in user by the
end of this video what will be able to
do is take on this field put in anything
like I love programming and click on
return and you will see that this has
got live updated into our database we
can confirm this by going into our
firebase database and seeing that here
it's got updated at the bottom we've got
an about node and either programming so
let's begin let's first set the delegate
for the text field control drive from
the text field to the me view controller
and select delegate coming here let's
implement the UI text field delegate
class so uitextfield delegate coming to
the about tab select the editing did
endmethod and control drag from here and
create a method called about did and
editing inside this what we will do is
we will send the data entered by the
user the text field to our database and
update it under it about node which is
inside the user profile step so let's
see how we're going to do that which is
self dot database left the database
stuff that we had created on top dot
child user profiles go to the user
profiles node dot child self tour logged
in user rod uid let's force unwrap this
dot child go to the about tab and set
the value entered by the user which will
be self dot about dot txt this will
update the data in a database also if
you do one more thing when we click on
the text field the keyboard will come up
but we have to create a method to hide
the keyboard once the user clicks enter
so let's see how we're going to do that
it's going to be a simple method which
is called text field should return and
we say text field dot resign first
transport
I will say return truth this will
basically help us hide the keyboard so
let's try this out so here we have the
meetup in front of us let us click on
this that changes to I love firebase
click return the keyboard get cereal and
the data should have been updated in our
database let us confirm that there we
have a firebase database and there we
can see be about node has been created
let's change this to programming for n
click return then we see there is a live
update to that and the about field is
getting updated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
