native so today we'll be learning how to
navigate between screens in a react
native app most applications are more
than one screen there has to be a way to
be able to navigate between these
screens in a nap in react native this is
done through this module known as react
navigation which is also recommended by
the guys at react native react
navigation is a cross-platform module so
it can be used both for iOS and Android
to be able to create a navigation
interface for those of you that are only
interested in targeting iOS react native
comes in built with a navigator iOS
module which you can use to do that
however in this video we're going to be
sticking with react navigation so let's
open up expo and create a new project
let's name the portrait stack navigator
their product is open let's open up our
favorite text editor my case that is
Visual Studio code and let's open up the
project that we just created let's
quickly test this out to see that if
it's working so there we have it the app
is currently working now let's install
the AG navigation opening up the
terminal within the project folder what
you have to do is you to type NPM
install save the act navigation the save
flag will make sure that it gets added
to our package store JSON file once
direct navigation is installed what we
also need to do is we need to run NPM
install in the folder because react
navigation requires some dependencies
which are missing and this will make
sure that they get installed that way
now that our dependencies are installed
we can just refresh the Apple here let's
come to our app purchase here on top
let's import react navigation so what we
want inside react navigation is the
stack navigator so we will say import
stack navigator from the act navigation
inside the default class app let's
remove this view component from here
coming here at the bottom what we'll do
is let's say constant app navigator is
equal to stack navigator and let's
create two screens let's call the first
one login screen and in and it needs to
point to a screen home screen
these here are the names
files that we are yet to create and here
what we do is we'd say apt navigator now
let's create the two files so let's
create a new folder here let's call it
screens create a new file inside screens
let's call the first one login screen no
js' and let's just return over here a
text field saying this is the login
screen so here you may have noticed that
I quickly typed out a lot of the code
it's just basic boilerplate code which
is created into a snippet when I create
a new screen so here at the top which is
important react component from react
next we're importing a view text and
style sheet these are important idea
fault whether we use them or not we
usually always need view and a text
field also next the name of the class
that were creating and then we need to
export the class that we're creating
here we just added that this is the
login screen which is a text similarly
as create the home screen
and add a texture that says this is the
home screen
now that we created the two screens we
need to import the two screens into our
apt rjs so that apertures knows that
they exist so is a import login screen
from
so what we did here was we imported the
login screen dot JS file from the
screens folder into the app purchase as
you can see we do not require to mention
the extension of the file that we're
importing and we named that file login
screen this could be any name but it
makes sense to just name it the name of
the actual file
similarly we imported home screen dot
J's from the screens folder and we named
it home screen now these two names are
provided here to the stack navigator in
which we have named two screens so
inside the stack Navigator we have said
that we want two screens one is the
login screen one is the home screen the
names over here on the left are the ones
that are referenced by the methods of
the stack navigator where they point to
other names of the files that we
imported so we imported the login screen
so the login screen here inside the
stack Navigator points to the imported
login screen and the home screen inside
the stack Navigator points to the
imported home screen now if we refresh
the app we should see the login screen
there you see the login screen is opened
up but there's no way for us to go to
the home screen so let's just create a
button on the login screen that takes us
to the home screen here in the import
let's import button and here with all
the text let's add that but it means our
own press property and it needs a title
go to the home screen and here inside
the on press we will use
props not navigation or navigate and go
to the home screen this is a method
which comes from react navigation it
allows us to navigate to the screen name
this screen name is coming from here is
the name given here and this name home
screen is coming from the name we've
given here when we imported the file so
let's see if it works there you see this
is the home screen and the back button
automatically gets generated if we click
on that it takes us back to the login
screen so this is a basic intro into
using the stack navigator in the next
video we learn how to add tabs at the
bottom along with the stack navigator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
