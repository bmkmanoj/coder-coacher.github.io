how to integrate facebook login for
firebase application for iOS so we'll go
on to the firebase website which is five
is removal calm will have to sign in
once you sign in and get the screen and
you can just click on get started
free this is gonna take us to our
console once you come to our console we
need to click on create new project
given in to your project for this
tutorial or gonna name this my app and
we leave the team country as a default
takes a few seconds with this app to be
created once the app is created you are
taking to your application dashboard
where you have all all these features
that are available that you can
integrate with firebase first thing we
need to do is we need to add firebase to
iOS application so we click on add Iowa
add five this to iOS app the first thing
we need is the iOS bundle this we will
get by going to our Xcode project so we
go to Xcode will have to click on create
new project it should bring you to this
screen select a single of your
applications and give your application
name we leave in my app only for
simplicity and ensure that Swift is
selected the name of the app does not
need to be the same as your firebase app
this is just for simplicity we click on
next we want saving around desktop for
now and the first thing that opens up
the page it gives us the bundle ID so we
copy this bundle ID come back paste it
here now when you click on idea it's
going to download the Google service
info dot P list file for your
application which you have to include
into your Xcode project so you click on
add app as you can see that it has
downloaded the Google service info dot
pedis file you can go here to our
downloads and oh I already had one from
an earlier project so I'm going to get
rid of this one and this is a new one
that was created or email me back to
Google service info dog pls and it asks
us to move the Google service in folder
police file you just downloaded into the
root of your Xcode project open up our
export project and drag this file
into a project me select copy items if
needed now we come back here and it is
one continue now we need to install the
firebase dependencies which can be done
by something known as cocoa pods to
learn more about cocoa pods you can
click this link so now we will copy this
and we need to open our terminal CD into
our project directory so you got a CD
desktop and we will see it into my
application here you can see that
application is there and we can create a
new pod file to drink porn in it
this creates our pod file is here now to
open the pod file we will use the Nano
editor and here below pods my app we
will add the pod firebase
now the next thing we need to do is pod
install which is pod install it will
install it 5s dependencies now once that
is done the important thing to remember
is disk reads and dot XC workspace file
for your application use this file
fulfill all future development on your
application currently we're using the
default X core application that we
created but it wants us to use the other
one which is I'll show you here if you
go to our desktop my app this is that
new father that is clear so we're going
to close the project here and open up
this one as you can see there is a pause
section that's added and our own
application is here time back here
continue and now we need to connect
firebase when I have starts up for that
really important is and we need to put
in this line of code fire app correction
Fi our app dot configure into our did
finish launching with options so let's
do that
Xcode my app app delegate import
firebase and did finish launching will
have F IR f dot configure and that's
that's it that's what we required for
the configuration now what we do is we
will open up the documentation and go to
the site go into the docs and go into
the get started guide for iOS so this
this portion is we have already
completed what we need to do is go to
the authentication section introduction
and go down it shows you all the
different ways that you can use
authentication what we need is federated
identity provider integration click on
the iOS tab for Facebook and it'll tell
you before you begin you must add this
pod so again open up item
or terminal of your choice nano into
your pod file add the dependency oops
and save that and pour it stuff so okay
and we have that installed we can go and
cross-check that you know parts we have
five days author across not says if you
haven't connected your app to a five
days project to survive this console
which is already been done on the
Facebook for developer site get the app
ID and the secret for your app and
enable facebook login from your firebase
console so first let's do let's get the
I app ID and app secret oh wait let's
first go into the five days console
again and go drive and go into opt it's
gonna give us the option set signup set
up sign-in method click on face edit
this and we need what we need is
released the app ID in the app secret
key what we do is we'll go to Facebook
developers which is developers at
facebook.com/ you'll have to create an
account here I already have an account
and I've signed in I will click on hover
over my apps and click on add a new app
and we select iOS as a platform and we
name our application Maya
and she'd need to put in email address
and for simplicity we named this put
this in his lifestyle and he'll create
app ID and I mean is not on the
waterfalls here
shut up is created we can follow this
QuickStart guide but will rather go
through the doc documentation later for
now we need the app ID which we can get
and by going to my app and when we come
into our dashboard we should see our app
ID right then copy the app ID equal to
five days
and paste the app ID here you also need
the app secret key for that we'll have
to enter in our Facebook password which
is already there so you can click on
show and it shows us the app secret key
we pop you guys come here and this and
we need to remember one more important
step which is to complete setup and this
order it redirect URI to your Facebook
app configuration so copy this URL go
back up suppose go back to your Facebook
developers page and click on add product
and we I'll get started on facebook
login and we need a best where an old
redirect you arise and we save changes
coming back to firebase and Facebook we
need to enable it as well so click Edit
and click on enable so so that is
enabled and free commander documentation
authentication introduction you
shouldn't have closed that yeah
so once we have that we have to we can
authenticate the firebase integrate
Facebook login into your app are
following the developers documentation
which we can see from here if we go into
Facebook developers documentation now
already on the docs page click on iOS
SDK and get started is first thing you
need to do is download the sdk and unzip
it into your documents slash Facebook
SDK folder in my case I've already done
that in an My Documents folder you can
see Facebook as sneaky you get these set
of files once you download it we've
already created a new Facebook app and
now when you configure the Facebook app
for iOS which is by going to the
settings in the dashboard we need to na
put in the bundle ID bundle ID and we
didn't able single sign-in so let's go
into app dashboard and settings we
already have an iOS application and we
we don't so we select add platform we
select iOS and if we're in a bundle idea
which again is what we put here paste
that in here and single sign-on of it
should be yes that is done we save the
changes and coming back to the
documentation
it tells us add the SDK to your Xcode
project open the document / Facebook SDK
and drag the Coquette framework so we
open up Xcode again open up a Finder
track this Coquette framework into the
frameworks folder if in case of
frameworks folder does not exist you can
create it and we deselect copy items and
mean it because we don't want the app to
blow it's gonna just reference it from
the document section and you need to add
this one more line to your film print
settings and the framework search path
in the build settings so we open our
explore again my app billing settings
framework search paths and you open this
up double click it and click on add I
taste this in and when you change this
username put your username folder on
your computer my case it's not followed
so like this you can see this by going
into here and you see you can go into
Macintosh which we users and you can see
the name that now once that is done we
can click out of that and go back to
eclipse now we need rex configured Xcode
project this was given in the QuickStart
once we created a Facebook app and we
need to copy this into our info dot
plist file which is side my app in for
oculus right click this and open a
source code at the bottom paste this in
before we make any changes of that for
iOS users only we need to whitelist the
Facebook apps so we copy this and paste
this below a previous space so what we
need now is we need the Facebook app ID
over here if you follow the QuickStart
it already has the app ID installed but
is not much a deal-breaker
so we copy this and paste this in here
we again paste on the app ID in here and
we also need the name of our application
which would match exactly of what on him
is that we given on Facebook so it's my
app and we save this now once that is
done you need to connect your
application delegate for that we have
this line of code but as you can see
that this is not in Swift in is in
Objective C and unfortunately Facebook
does not have the documentation
available in Swift as well but this is
very beautiful website called objective
to Swift comm which lets you convert
Objective C very easily into Swift click
on convert now paste in the Objective C
code on the left and click on convert
there we have it just copy that come
back to Xcode go into app delegate and
it tells us to paste in our deed
finished with launch did finish
launching with options method and as you
can see we're getting an error here
under solver in fact that's because need
to import our Facebook SDK now you get
and you should see that
coming back we also need to add a
handler function which handles any of
the errors that are there so we need to
also add the open URL method copy this
go into swift v paste it here
coming back here we can just paste it
below you our application rather and
giving us a medal okay we'd save 2.0 it
asked we had to put in a best mark now
that's been done you can ignore this
other area we come back to the
documentation we need we haven't this is
this is optional this section if you'd
like to log events on your Facebook
developers page you can do this but
firebase is gonna do this for us anyways
but I mean still just do it for
simplicity but post this in word it and
where does it want us try at it and it
wants us to add an application did
become active was this year this is done
coming back to the documentation now
what we need is we need to add facebook
login
we've already now we've already done the
general setup what we need to do is drag
the facebook login kitna earlier we in
only track the pocket now we also need
to log in kit we've got a Facebook SDK
and we died it selected and put it into
the same box folder like we did before
remember these are our copy items have
needed and test with that now we need to
add the button so what we'll do is we
need the facebook login button you just
copy this line of code here copy it
totus 55 paste the same
what this does is it gives us code for
the for creating the facebook login
button we come into a view controller
because we'd want this to happen from
our view controller and we paste this in
here
we'll also do one thing that we'll put
this man for outside so that it's
accessible as you can see it's giving us
an error so we can import his book login
kid and the error is gone
now with the login button you have to
also ask for permissions so we look for
permissions there we have it and we
paste the permissions in before the
Putnam is ready
these are the default set of permissions
available if you want to give I mean you
need if you want other information about
the person you're gonna have to add to
add it into the given in for review
before it can be added into your app
also what we have to do is since we're
adding the button in we can also tap the
login button clicked method and the
tiddle logout method that if you can see
if you come here is to get notifications
or login results or logout events
assign a delegate to facebook login
button that confirms to facebook login
button delegate so let's click on it
what it tells us is that we need this
method is mandatory and we also need
this Methodism which is mandatory
and we oven we have the login button did
logout and the login button methods
which are mandatory so we get the login
button method which is given here before
that we need to put in you need to
implement the facebook login button
delegate which will ask us which will
give us an error until we implement its
methods the login button we could find
it here it's a reload to us and we will
for now with the Sprinter user logged in
you also need implement the logout
button the login button did logout and
will print in use a dead log out as we
can see when we go back to the firebase
documentation it's it asks us to set the
delegate to self which is the view
controller within which it is acting
that we must do so will you come back
put this in here and wait we do is wait
for himself so explicitly access it and
what this client code is doing is it is
just centering the button this line of
code is giving us permissions and this
is setting the delegate and this line of
code is adding the button to the actual
view
as you can see the example of the login
button is also given here but the logout
button is not mentioned so as of now if
we go and we just run this application
we should see the login button on the
page on the simulator and there we have
the login button which if we click on it
it should take us to Facebook and says
you have already your app will receive a
public profile friends listen email
continuous balloon and as you can see
it's logged in and you click on logout
click on on clicking on log out logs
alter the user and in the next video I
will show you a more practical
implementation of how to integrate the
facebook login along with the firebase
authentication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
