uses firebase react native and swipeable
lists basically the thing is it's a
contacts app in which you can add a new
contact then you can swipe the contact
to either delete it
Oh view its information they'll take
advantage of the firebase real-time
database and store our details in that
database
so let's see how we're going to go about
this so here I'm starting with an empty
react native project the only thing that
I've done here is I've configured and
imported firebase into this project for
those of you that are unfamiliar with
how to do that they can refer to my
previous videos of this series I've
added the link for that video in the
description next before we start we just
need to install one UI library that
we're gonna be using
it's called native base it gives us some
nice components that help us design our
application all we need to do is type
NPM install native this since I've
already installed it I'm not going to be
doing this once native place is
installed we can import components from
native bits like we do it from react
native let's are creating a layout so
let's get rid of this view over here and
let's put in a header inside the header
we'll have a contact
an item inside that I'd put in an input
once a placeholder is equal to add name
and let us say that so that doesn't seem
quite right let's fix that let's get rid
of the padding and the justified content
here from the container save that and
then we can see that the add name input
has moved to the top we'll also add one
style here to the header this is for
Android devices mainly basically we say
margin-top is equal to status bar dot
current height and as you can see over
here status bar has automatically been
imported by visual studio code for me
this fixes a glitch on Android devices
of header getting hidden above the dock
next let's add a button to the input
field so make sure that you important
part in here from native this coming
after the input and below this and a
button inside that will put in an icon
of name equal to add these icons are
also provided to us by native base so
let's import icon here at the top and
save that out there you can see we've
got a nice and button over here now
let's start creating a list
let's first important is true from the
AG native here
coming side the component let's create a
constructor always called super props
inside and create a constant BS which
will be a new list view dot data source
row has changed and when our one is not
equal equal to r2 so this is the basic
syntax of creating a list view data
source next let's create a state so this
start state that's a list view data is
equal to a variable called data which
we'll just create and we will say new
contact and leave that blank so let's
create that variable here
and you make it an empty array next
let's start reading the list so come
here below the header create another
content inside that what we'll do is we
need to put in a list this list is
different from the list view which we
import from react native so let's import
that it's a part of NATO base but also
important list item which will display
inside the list the whole start leaving
the list let's change this constant to
an object so that we have access to this
inside our render method
come here inside the list let's load the
data source to read this dot d s dot
clone with rows like we did above this
dog state dot list view data as of now
list view data as empty as we haven't
populated this array let's put in two
names and now we need to display this
data here so we put in a render row
method passing the data inside that will
load a list item
safe text data make sure to put that
data in brackets as you notice unless
the still empty that's because we're
using the list that native base provides
us and that's a swipeable list what we
need to do is we need to create the left
and right buttons as well then display
when the row is swiped only then will we
get the data of the list displayed to us
very easy let's do that first let us
correct this typo here there should be a
capital S in the data source so coming
here let's false at end of the left
button which will be render left hidden
row side that we passed in the data
button give it a proper full so that it
stretches and inside that we'll put in
an icon of the name information circle
similarly we render the right button so
let us copy this paste it in here call
this render right hidden bro and in the
button and icon let's put in trash and
let's make this a color of red that
bring in a crop of danger also you know
put in the values for the left and the
right opening values for the buttons
outside the bracket if we left open
value is equal to minus 75 and right
open value is equal to minus 75 as well
this is to display the side buttons
let's save that out and there you can
see we're getting our two values that we
put it and let's wipe this as we can see
we get the I on the left side every
swipe to the left we get the delete
button so in the next video I'll show
you how to connect these buttons to
apply this database and make them work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
