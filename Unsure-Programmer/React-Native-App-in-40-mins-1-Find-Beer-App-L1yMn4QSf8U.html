react native today we will be building a
complete react native app from scratch
using export this app we'll be building
today will allow us to search beers from
a remote database and display the beers
in our application things that we need
in today's tutorial will be node.js that
has to be installed on your machine
along with react native and export for
those of you new to react native and
expo i have a video linked in the
description that will help you install
it so this is the app in front of us you
can click on search beers it takes us to
another screen where we can enter the
name of the beer we want to search so
let's enter Corona it searches the data
for the beer from the remote database
and brings it to us which we format and
display on our screen we'll also build
this functionality of adding the beer to
our favorites by clicking on this button
here and then we can access the beer
from our favorites a shout out to the
guys and brewery door DB whose database
I'm gonna be using I'll also help you
guys set that up in this tutorial so
let's begin so let's start by creating a
new project open up expo click on create
new project now we call the project fine
beer so there we have the project
created let's quickly come here and
change this over to localhost so that
our app refresh is much faster and let's
test this out so that we can see that
the app is working let's open up the
project in our favorite code editor in
my case that's Visual Studio code so
let's first install the dependencies
that we require for this project
the three main dependencies that we use
the first one is called the Acme
vacation it's to create a navigation
system within our application that
consists of the stack navigators in the
tab navigators the next dependency is
called Axios it's a library that helps
us make HTTP requests there are some
inherent benefits over the tea
fault fetch request that's there in the
act Nader so we've used this library the
last one is a UI library called native
base basically it has inbuilt components
which make our life easier in styling my
application so let's open up the
terminal within the folder of our
application let's install native base
next we'll install Axios and lastly
let's install react navigation there are
three in dependencies are installed we
can confirm that by coming into Visual
Studio code and going to the package
store JSON now we see AG zeros native
base and react navigation are installed
now that we have our dependency is
installed let me just walk you through
what the app is going to look like so
here I've just made a file called folder
layout well basically I want to have two
main screens in our application which is
the home screen and the Search tab
navigator screen the home screen is
going to link to the Search tab
navigator which inside it will have two
tabs on as the search tab and one is the
favorites tab in a folder layout what we
have is we have the assets folder
already created for us over here in that
there'll be a home screen folder which
will contain the background image for
the home screen and we'll create a
components folder which will have one
home folder for the home screen and once
search folder for the search term
navigator screen and similarly matching
the layout of the screens we have a
search tab file and a favorites tab file
for each screen these are the files that
you see over here are basically reusable
components which we split out from the
Search tab file so let's start creating
our folders so the root let's create the
first folder which is components inside
components we'll create two folders
which is the home folder and the search
folder inside the home folder we'll have
the file home screen dot J's
and inside the search folder we'll have
the file search tab navigator dot yes so
let's leave the file so that will add
the further files as and when we need
them so let's start with our root file
which is the a Porteous this is the
entry point for any app here we can get
rid of the styles and also the export
default class what we do is we'll import
the stack navigator and let's create our
app so we have a root level stack
navigator which has two screens first
one is a home screen the second one is
the search term navigator screen we have
to import these two to just do
and let's export the app now let's open
up the home screen inside the home
screen let's create a class called home
screen here we can we're just importing
react and component from react and view
tags and style sheet from react native
here we just pass a text which says hi
from the home screen and the search time
Navigator will do the similar thing and
we won't return anything here because we
cannot access the screen yet let's test
this out so there we have it it's saying
hi from the home screen some of you may
get a red screen here with this error
cannot find entry file nor underscore
modules so what you basically need to do
is you just run npm install inside your
app folder if that doesn't work which is
it ii start or export project close out
the simulator and share the app on the
simulator again that should do the trick
it seems like it's some issue with the
mo version of node that you have in your
machine so now let's go ahead and build
a layout come to the home screen dot j s
get rid of the hi from the home screen
and add a button here let's import the
button from native base
let's add the text search beers also
let's make this button block and let's
set the style to white so a button is
created let's add a style sheet here
let's create a class called home screen
view give it a flex of one and justify
content of flex n let's add this to the
view and this will be style here so
there you see a button is coming right
at the bottom just like we wanted if we
click it nothing happens so for that
let's or add an on press draw button
we have mountains here when we click the
button it navigates us to the Search tab
navigator so it uses this dot props or
navigation or navigate and search that
damn navigator which it gets from here
so let's test it out as we see it takes
us to the Search tab navigator coming
back to the home screen
now we need an image as the background
image what I've done is I've already
copied the image into the assets folder
and called it home screen background
like we discussed for you I'll leave the
link of the image in the description and
you can download it let's get the image
so we need to require the image from the
folder here we need to create another
view and we need to position the image
absolutely so that we can get the image
as a background so let's put a view here
inside the view wheel at the image and
we'll give a style to the image flex of
1 and height of null and width of null
and here the parent what we do is give a
position of absolute top of zero left of
zero and a height and width of 100% make
sure that the percentage design quotes
and here the background should be in
curly brackets and as we can see we have
an imported image so let's import image
here we'll import it from react native
itself and as you save this out we can
see our background images come but we
have this header bar over here which we
do not need at least for the home screen
so let's remove that react navigation
has some properties that we can set to
change the behavior of the header so
let's set that set the header to none in
the navigation options and there you can
see we have the image coming up we have
the button if we click the button it
takes us to the search term navigator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
