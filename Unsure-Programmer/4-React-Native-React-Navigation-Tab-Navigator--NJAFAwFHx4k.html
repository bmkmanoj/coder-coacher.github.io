navigator to application let's now add
some tabs to our application for that
first let's import tab navigator so tab
navigator is also imported from react
navigation like we imported the stack
navigator earlier next we'll have to
define the tab navigator let's call it
home screen tab navigator here we have
to create a set of screens so let's call
the first screen the home screen and
this point to a screen named home screen
and let's call second on notifications
and it points to a screen call
notification so you already have a home
screen created over here let's also
create the notification screen and let's
put in a view here which has a text
which just says this is the notification
screen we need to make sure that from
here we also change this to export our
home screen time Navigator so let's save
that in test route
so here when the user now goes to the
home screen it should show the home
screen that navigator there we have the
home screen we have a home screen tab
and a notifications tab so as you can
see right now the tab navigator looks
very basic the agnya navigation does
allow us to add a lot of customizations
to our time navigator we just add one
basic one right now so coming here we
can just add it we say animation enabled
equal to true
here now we'll see when you come here
clicking on the tab shows that nice
slide animation so now we know how to
structure our basic app we have a stack
navigator inside which we've added a tab
navigator which is how most usual apps
are so the next videos we'll build on
something and create a new app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
