workshop which is the Android studio
program I suggest you watch me so that
you can have a sense of what the process
looks like and then follow the text
version instructions at your own pace
also keep in mind that these are large
files you're going to want to have a
strong and stable internet connection
for students with slower and more
unreliable internet you might want to
consider finding a wired internet
connection also if things are taking a
while to load or download and you're
getting bored feel free to go to the
next node which has a quick review quiz
game that you could do while Android
studio is downloading I've created the
walkthrough for how to download Android
studio onto different operating systems
I have instructions for Windows and
instructions for Mac computers I'll give
you a moment go ahead and click on which
one applies to you
okay I'm going to be installing Android
studio on a Windows machine please note
that this screencast is done on April
7th 2015 and I say that just because
sometimes the screens or the icons that
you might see while installing Android
studio could change depending on what
version it is we're going to give you a
text version to go along with this
screencast and since it's easier to
change the text version than to go
through re-recording an entire
screencast that will be a little bit
more up to date than the screencast well
alright so to start off go ahead and
open a web browser and go to the Android
studio website it's linked in the
instructor notes you do not have to type
this in alright so once you've arrived
on the site you should see a big green
button that's pretty obvious that says
download Android studio for Windows so
go ahead and click that alright and
that's going to take you to these
license for Android studio you're
welcome to go ahead and read that I'm
going to scroll to the bottom sign my
rights away and then click this download
Android studio for Windows button
alright we did want to download this so
we do want to keep it I'm going to press
keep okay and if you look right here
this is a little bit less than a gig of
data and that's about equivalent to
downloading a movie file of reasonable
quality so you can judge how long this
will take based on your internet
connection okay once it's finished
downloading go ahead and double click
the file we did in fact want to run this
so click run yes we did want to load to
make changes all right and now we're at
the Android studio setup wizard this is
going to guide you through a collection
of screens to set up Android studio and
pretty much always we're going to just
select the defaults all right so I'm
going to hit next
I want all these boxes checked note that
this requires three point eight
gigabytes of space and we only download
about a gigabyte so after this there's
going to be even more downloading I'm
gonna hit next it's a license agreement
here you can go ahead and read it if
you'd like I'm going to go ahead and hit
I agree
oh yes I agree more okay I'm alright
with all of these standard install
locations alright going to say next on
the emulator setup we'll talk about this
later
sure let's make a start menu folder and
going to hit install which will bring me
to this screen of course if you like
staring at loading bars feel for you all
right it looks like it completed I could
go ahead and take a look at the show
details and I'm not seeing anything here
about huge errors so that's good all
right I'm going to go ahead and click
Next
okay so the install looks like it
finished we click finish this is the
little loading screen for Android studio
when it starts up okay now this is
asking if I have some settings from a
previous version of Android studio and
I'm pretty sure that you don't so you
probably want to hit the I don't have a
previous version of Android studio or I
don't want to import my settings and go
ahead and hit OK it's just going ahead
and downloading a few more components
for me now once you see this screen you
know that you've got Android studio up
and running but the real test to see if
you did everything correctly will be if
you can make your first app using it
alright so this completes the
installation video and now you're going
to do this process on your own alright
I'm going to download Android studio on
a Mac note that this screencast was done
April 6 2015 and the reason I'm saying
that is because sometimes this process
will change we will always provide you
with text instructions for the install
process and we will keep those
instructions up to date so if things
look a little bit different here and
there
don't worry check out the text install
structions alright and with that little
mini now let's get started ok so the
first thing you're going to do is click
the link in the instructor notes below
to get to the Android studio homepage
don't try typing this out just click the
link in the instructor notes once you're
here there's going to be a pretty
obvious button that says download
Android studio and it should say for mac
go ahead and click it at this point
you'll see a license agreement you can
read it if you like and then go ahead
and scroll down click the key Fred it
and then click this download Android
studio for Mac button ok so it's started
downloading here for me now you should
be able to see that this download is a
couple hundred megabytes once it's
downloaded go ahead and double click it
you should see this big beautiful screen
that says Android studio and it is with
most applications you're going to go
ahead and click Android studio and drag
it into your Applications folder that
will copy over after you successfully
done that you can go ahead and double
click
Android studio which will try to
actually open Android studio you might
get a warning about it being downloaded
from the web but we did mean to download
this and we did mean to run it so go
ahead and click open alright and this
little screen should appear to load up
the installation process alright and
here we are at the Welcome wizard what
follows is going to be a list of screens
and licenses and you pretty much just
want to keep the defaults click Next
this is a screen asking me where my java
development kit is now we just installed
that and it's actually making a guess
about where it is if it isn't guessing
you can click the detect button and if
that isn't working you can try
navigating your filesystem to go exactly
to where you downloaded it if you're
having trouble with this step it
probably means that there were issues
with downloading the Java development
kit you might have downloaded the wrong
file or just something might not be
configured right try going through the
instructions again or checking out the
troubleshooting documents everything
seems to be working here so I'm going to
go ahead and click Next now we're not
doing anything too crazy so I'm going to
choose a standard installation here are
some of the licenses that I was talking
about go ahead and click on this first
license and say accept they'll accept
all these licenses down here you'll have
to click on the next license set here
and also hit accept and this will let
you finish the Android studio setup
wizard ok when I click finish it's
actually going to download a lot of
stuff and when all this entails is
downloading a couple gigs of data which
is sort of a huge amount of stuff to
download so be patient this might take
some time if you're getting bored of
staring at a loading bar you can go
ahead and click to the next video where
we have a little review game to go over
some of the stuff we've already learned
if you see this window go ahead and type
in your password and the candy cane
stripes here mean that this is close to
done awesome and once you're done you
should see this screen hopefully there's
a lot of positive language like
successfully installation pass
successfully created if you see any
errors here it could mean that there are
errors with the installation but things
look good so I'm going to go ahead and
click finish now once you see this
screen you know that you've got Android
studio up and running so
but the real test is going to be seeing
if we did everything correctly enough
that we can create our own apps using it
all right so now you've watched me do
the steps once I want you to go ahead
and download Android studio yourself if
the downloading is taking a while but
you still want to be doing Android stuff
feel free to move on to the next node
where we have a review game to pass the
time while things install</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
