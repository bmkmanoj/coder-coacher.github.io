machine the first one here on the left
is the one that we introduced in the
first unit and it is not allowed to use
the if-better function so this is
something that is although as we
discussed it has some differences to
your standard computer it's more or less
close to your normal computer and here
on the right side we have the RAM with
the if-better function and this of
course is a much more powerful machine
so as you can see it's buzzing with
computational power here and this is
totally unlike your standard computer
because it has this guessing function
here built in and of course if somebody
asked us to build this sort of Ram
machine at least I would turn them down
immediately because it's not clear at
all how we should write such a function
it seems far too powerful and at least
to me frankly also a bit mysterious so
that's also basically the difference
between the two machines because here on
the standard Ram it's very clear what
each of the functions that it has does
actually if you know what the machine is
currently doing then you can always
predict what it will do next because for
every instruction is very clear what it
does given certain variables or inputs
and not so with the RAM that uses C if
better function well actually most of
the time unless this function is used
it's still clear what happens next but
every time this function here is called
we don't really know what's that going
to happen next it seems as if only this
function here kind of knows or if you
put it in another way if you go through
an algorithm that is written on a
standard Ram then you can basically go
through it step by step by step by hand
and say how it's going to behave for
this Ram over here you could also go
through it step by step by step but once
you encounter this if-better function
here you could not really say what it's
going to do next you would have to try
different cases and so in order to
better distinguish those two models
there's a special terminology in
theoretical computer science called
determinism and non determinism and this
standard Ram machine because we always
know what's going to happen next is
called deterministic and surprise this
one over here is called non
deterministic now it's very important
that you familiarize yourself with those
two terms because
we're going to use them a lot in this
course and just to make you think about
them a little bit more I would like to
do a little quiz with you so what I
would like you to think about is if
you're using the if-better function in a
program and we run the same program code
multiple times
can we get different solutions if we are
running it on the same input or will we
always get the same solution so if you
think that non-determinism can produce
different solutions on the same input
using the same code then please check
yes otherwise check No</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
