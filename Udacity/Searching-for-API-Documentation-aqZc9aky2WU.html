local host server let's try seeing if we
can get information from other servers
out on the internet let's say I want to
try to access the API for SoundCloud an
online audio distribution platform that
enables its users to upload record
promote and share their originally
created sounds in order to figure out
what requests i can send to the
soundcloud server i will go to their
developer website and search through the
documentation to control and protect
their resources soundcloud requires
developers to register each application
they want to create that will
communicate with their api once my
account is created I'm provided a client
ID and client secret I can embed these
credentials into my requests in order to
successfully access the SoundCloud API
now searching through the documentation
I see the resources that are available
for me to access along with some
examples on how to create request to
access this information many of the
posts put and delete methods are
protected with access tokens since my
app would need permission from end users
in order to post information to
SoundCloud on their behalf so for now
I'm just going to build a get request to
view the contents of a playlist with the
following playlist ID I must also add my
client ID so SoundCloud could recognize
that it's my application trying to
communicate with the server I can build
the request using curl or postman send
it off and see that I received their
successful response if i open the
permalink URL provided in the response i
can also see the HTML page that contains
display this information in my browser
in this next video you'll be able to
delve into some api's on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
