the mean divided by standard deviation
in other words the number of standard
deviations that the original value is
from the mean then a negative z-score
means that the mean is greater than X
that must mean that X is somewhere down
here so that doesn't necessarily mean
that the original value is negative
though it could be it does mean that the
original value is less than the mean the
original value is less than 0
it basically says the same thing as this
first one that the original value is
negative and this one the original value
X minus the mean is negative must also
be true because for the z-score to be
negative then this is going to be
negative because the standard deviation
is always positive just to review
remember when we calculated standard
deviation we squared all the deviations
so all the deviations are then positive
because if you square anything negative
or positive you get a positive number
and then we just took the average
squared deviation which is still
positive and then we took the square
root which is still positive so remember
that the standard deviation will always
be positive which means that if the
z-score is negative then this numerator
must be negative and that must mean that
X is less than mu</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
