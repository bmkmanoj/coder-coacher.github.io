to say the DNA and life in general is
really just organic chemistry that
crawls
I thought analogy but once we started
talking about chemistry as DNA it's just
a little mad yeah it's true the the
details and chemistry can be a little
complex especially if you don't have the
chemistry background and really those
details are out of the scope of our
course so what we're gonna do is replace
the chemistry with symbols or our
letters to make things easier I mean I
like it it does seem a little easier and
just looking at the letters I think I
can see a pattern Oh what kind of
pattern do you think you see well if I
look at one side I think I can judge the
letters that are gonna be on the other
right yeah that's actually really good
and important sometimes when we discover
a new genome and we don't know much
about it yet we want to know what it's
made of being able to count the number
of adenine thymine guanine cytosine x'
the a's t's g's and C's the letters of
DNA can actually give us information
about how many genes might be in that
genome so take a look at the strand here
now if I don't give you the other side
can you tell me what percentage of the
whole DNA structure is guanine or G's
now this can get a little tricky so if
you get stuck take a look at the base
pairing rules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
