alternative is actually a top q-learning
which is what you described you
basically take which everything have the
most associated with it the most value
okay yeah okay the most value and that
works pretty well again those are the
kind of things that you would probably
come up with if you just spend a little
bit of time just say well what are the
obvious things that you could do both of
those make sense it of course also has a
problem and that problem is that the
agent there are several problems but one
that isn't necessarily obvious is the
agent that happens to have given the
most Q value to a particular action may
also give very nearly the same q value
to all the other actions as well so it
doesn't actually have a strong
preference it just happens to have put
high value on everything and so you're
not really doing much for it either
meanwhile may every other agent might
for example like the second action for
that particular agent and so it makes a
lot more sense to take the second action
but you can't because by a quirk of fate
the other action got slightly more value
to it for just that one agent so it
starts to feel a little bit like a
negotiation right which is why there's
something called negotiated w learning w
there so this is a lot more complicated
and I can't write it down in just a
fancy little equation like that but what
negotiated w learning basically boils
down to is the agent with the most to
lose gets to figure out what the action
is so you sort of minimize loss rather
than maximize an average or pick the
best thing so you look at the the sub
agent that basically what you do is
instead of looking at the things that
everyone thinks might be good and
averaging them or doing a max over them
you look at the things where the
difference between the big choice though
the maximum choice and the minimum
choice are really large and let that
agent make a decision and you sort of
waited across all of the actions it can
be arbitrarily complicated but basically
you don't want any agent to lose as
opposed to having agents win and all of
these have their strengths and all these
have
their weaknesses and they're all very
kind of cool and under different
circumstances greatest mass makes sense
in other circumstances top makes sense
and negotiated is good for other
situations and you can come up with lots
of other things the key thing is that
you need to do arbitration the problem
with all of these though all of these
methods and any other methods that you
come up with is that they're terrible
and in fact they're impossible what does
that mean you say well what does that
mean I'm going to summarize it simply
this the very first example you gave you
said or the very first response that you
gave to me when I described greatest
mask you learning as you said Oh what
you're really doing is you're voting and
voting is definitely not impossible ah
but as you know there is an
impossibility result for voting and that
is arrows impossibility result and if
you don't know what arrows impossibility
result is for voting then you need to
stop what you're doing right now and go
look it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
