the last quiz you may have mentioned
using a relative layout I know we did
but I want to introduce you to another
way that you can build a layout for our
app that will be more ideal using nested
view groups nested view groups means
putting view groups inside other view
groups that way you can build more
interesting and complex layouts like
these let's see how you would build up
one of these layouts say for example you
have a vertical linear layout with three
views an image view and two text views
what if you wanted to overlay some text
on top of this image well with a linear
layout you can't overlap views but with
the relative layout you can so we can
replace this child with a relative
layout instead then we can put the image
view inside this relative layout this
image view is now aligned to each edge
of the parent relative layout so there
you see an example of a relative layout
that's contained within a larger linear
layout you can have many combinations of
view groups within other view groups for
instance you can have a relative layout
as a root view for an app that can
contain a couple of views like an image
view and two text views you can also add
a linear layout as a child of this
broader relative layout this linear
layout itself can contain other children
like to image views you can nest as many
view groups inside other view groups as
you want however be careful because the
more nesting that you do the more
expensive it will be for your app to
layout on the screen the relative layout
in particular is a very flexible layout
but can be very complex to calculate the
position of each of these views relative
to others so it's recommended to not
have too many layers of nesting within a
relative layout I pulled some examples
from real-life google apps to show you
some cases where it would be useful to
use nested view groups the Google now
app shows you cards of relevant
information based on your current
situation like the current time or
current location if you like a certain
team like the Red Sox good choice then
it can show you the score for the latest
game to build up the layout for this
card you can imagine using a vertical
linear layout because the information is
displayed
as rows however the first item in this
vertical linearlayout is not just a
single textview it's made up of multiple
views in fact you would build this first
item as a horizontal linear layout made
up of an image view and two text views
same for the second item in this
vertical linear layout you would build
it with a horizontal linear layout
containing an image you and two text
views another card in the Google now app
shows relevant stocks that you may be
interested in I wish the Google stock
was still at that price anyways you can
also build out this layout adds a
vertical linear layout because you can
imagine the rows here except these
middle entries aren't just a single text
view they're made up of multiple text
views for this line item relating to the
Google stock price you could use a
horizontal linear layout and fill it
with four text views same for the other
stock prices as well these horizontal
linear layouts are children of this
broader vertical linear layout in the
Google Play Music app you can of course
listen to music while this looks like a
complicated layout to build you can
actually break it down into smaller view
groups that you recognize this pattern
feels like a vertical linear layout with
three different children this first
child can be built using a relative
layout because the views are relative to
each other
this second child can also be built
using a relative layout because the
views are overlapping each other
and this third child here looks like a
horizontal linear layout made up of five
different buttons again we can use
nested view groups to build out this
screen this is just one way to build out
the layout you can build it in many
other ways as well in the Google Maps
app earlier we saw that there are
detailed pages for individual locations
like restaurants you can't build out
this screen with just a single linear
layout or a single relative layout you
need to nest a bunch of view groups
together on a broad scale we can see
that the information is almost organized
into rows so we can use a vertical
linear layout as the parent view one
child could be this whole out here
another child could be this row of
buttons another child would be this
description and so on but within each
child is not just a single view we have
multiple views this child in the broader
vertical linear layout is made up of
three individual
views so you can use a horizontal linear
layout with equal weights to each view
so that they get spread out evenly this
child in the broader vertical linear
layout can also be made up of a
horizontal linear layout with an image
view and a text view if you keep
scrolling this page you see more
information on the restaurant again I
can imagine the individual rows of
information here using a vertical linear
layout for all this information still
works and again some rows are more
complex than just a single text view
this row shows a bunch of available
times where you can make a reservation
and it's made up of three different
buttons that you can arrange using a
horizontal linear layout this row of
pictures can be built using a horizontal
linear layout as well and actually
within this horizontal linear layout
this first child is not just a single
image view it's an image view with a
text view so you could use a relative
layout to build out this first child so
you can see how there can be view groups
within view groups within view groups
there's actually more view groups beyond
just relative layout and linear layout
there's also frame layout and grid
layout we're not going to have time to
cover those in this course but I
definitely recommend that you go out and
learn about them on your own because
sometimes those would be better than
just using a relative or linear layout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
