our pendulum and this is our pivot point
well when I pull back the pendulum it's
gonna trace out this circle now of
course I'm constraining myself to small
angles so let's get rid of most that
circle but when I pull back by pendulum
by an angle of theta well let's say this
pendulum has some length L that's the
distance from here to here well we can
do the same sort of ratio that we did
way back in unit 1 when we were
measuring the circumference of the earth
this angle theta when compared to the
entire angle of the circle 2 pi radians
is in the same ratio as this arc length
which I'm going to call X - the entire
circumference of the circle which is 2
pi times the radius or L if this isn't
clear let me just explain this one more
time what I'm saying is the ratio of
this angle to the entire 360 degrees or
two pi radians of a circle
well that's identical to the ratio of
this distance to the total circumference
this angle to the total angle is the
same as this distance to the total
distance what I'm trying to do is
replace this theta so I'm going to solve
for theta when I do I get theta equals x
over L now we're making progress let's
see what happens well now I have the a
is equal to minus G times x over L
having made that replacement or put
another way a equals minus G over L
times X minus something times X we have
simple harmonic motion in our pendulum
wonderful now I'm going to ask you a
very hard question because it's gonna
have you put together a lot of the
things we've been talking about so we're
trying to design a clock we want a
period of one second I want to know how
long should our pendulum be if we want a
period of one second don't forget that
this something here becomes Omega
squared enter your answer here in meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
