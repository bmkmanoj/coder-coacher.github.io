procedure here the first thing we want
to do is build a list of all carrier
values we could do that by hand it might
actually be a little bit easier to do it
that way just by looking at the HTML we
then need to build a list of airport
values now there are a lot of values
here so what we probably want to do is
actually write a little script that will
actually pull those out okay so all
pages are going to have exactly the same
list for both of these so we can just
use the browser to download an example
page and pull those values out next what
we need to do is make HTTP requests to
download all the data I'll talk about
why we want to download it all in just a
minute then what we want to do is parse
the data files the reason why we want to
do it this way is because in building
our parser we want to make sure we're
working with data that isn't going to
change and after the fact once we do a
little bit of data cleaning we may
discover that the reason why we've got
some dirty data is actually because we
have a bug in our parser much easier to
figure out where that bug is if we've
still got the original data we were
using to parse I should also point out
that it really doesn't make sense to
download the data over and over again as
we're figuring out how to parse it
something else you might want to keep in
mind is that for years prior to the
current year the data isn't going to
change so there's no reason to retrieve
it more than once so this is actually a
bit of a best practice when you've got a
situation like the one we have here and
when you've got a scraping task it's
often going to look something like this
you really want to grab all the data you
need first and then do your scraping in
a separate process so what we have for
this particular problem is essentially
three different steps we first have to
build all the values we're going to use
to make HTTP requests we then need to
make all the HTTP requests and download
the data we need and then finally we're
going to parse the data we want out of
those data files shaping it into the
particular pieces of data the particular
items that we want to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
