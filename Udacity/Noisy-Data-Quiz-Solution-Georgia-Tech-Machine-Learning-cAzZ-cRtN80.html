think well I could work through it I
don't actually have the number yet okay
let's do that
so all right so in a world where this in
a world where this has the hypothesis
that actually matters we're saying that
X comes in the hypothesis spit that same
X out and then this noise process causes
it to become a multiple and the
probability of multiple is this one over
two to the case so the probability that
that would happen from this hypothesis
for the very first data item the one to
five would be 1/32 that's the
probability that a one would produce a
five by this process okay how do you
think how do you figure that out because
it's cuz the K that we would need the
multiplier would have to be five and so
the probability for that multiplier is
exactly 1 over 2 to the 5 which is 1/32
okay and so then I would use that same
thought process on the next one which
says that it's doubled and the way that
this particular process would have
produced a doubling would be if with
with probability 1/4 and the next data
element would have been produced by this
process with probability 1/2 because
it's K would be 1 and 1 over 2 to the K
would be 1/2 okay I like this alright
the next one would be 1/8 because it's
tripled mm-hmm
and the last one is also a multiplier of
5 just like the first one - that would
be 1/32 as well mm-hmm all right but now
we need to assign a probability to the
whole data set and because you told me
that it was okay to think about each of
these things happening independently the
probability that all these things would
have happened is exactly the product
right so I'll multiply 1/32 and 1/4 and
1/2 and 1/8 and 1/32 so that's like
factor of 5 plus 2 is 7 plus 1 is 8 plus
another 3 is 11 plus another 5 is 16 and
2 to the 16 is 65,536 so it should be 1
over oh you already wrote it 65,536 yeah
that yes it's absolutely correct Michael
well done okay so that's right but you
did it with a bunch of specific numbers
is there a more generic
their general form that we could write
down yeah I think so cuz I was doing
something pretty pretty regular once I
fell into a pattern so I took the D and
divided by X so D over X tells me the
the multiplier that was used so that's
like the K so D over X gave you the K
and it was one over to do that okay so
one over to do that and it was then the
product of that quantity for all of the
data elements so all the I so product
over all the eyes of that okay but we
have to be careful because if it was the
case that for any of our excise the D
wasn't a multiple of it that can't
happen under this hypothesis and the
whole probability needs to go to zero so
they all have to be divisible otherwise
all bets are off
okay so in other words if divide mod X
of I is equal to zero then this formula
holds and it's zero otherwise
exactly okay sounds good okay great
Michael so that's right and that was
exactly the right way of thinking about
it and now what we're gonna do next is
we're gonna take what we've just gone
through the sort of process of thinking
about how to generate data labels for
you know noisy cases and we're gonna
apply it to what I think you will find
would be a pretty cool derivation so I'm
good awesome excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
