quite work out for us we want to keep
asking the user to enter a value less
than 100 and we want to keep doing it
while they enter a value greater equal
than 100 but really what we want to do
is we want to go through the loop once
and then do the check and then if the
check failed go through the loop again
and so on the key is we want to go
through it at least once the way to do
that in Java is to move the while
statement the wild condition to the
bottom and to add the word do to the top
if there were two on the top the wild
condition on the bottom and this is
called a true loop let's look at a
program that uses it so here's our
program it has the do loop that you've
just seen so we keep asking the user
please enter an integer less than 100
until they do in other words we stay in
the loop while the input is greater
equal than 100 and then this program
doesn't do anything with it it just says
thank you for entering a value of less
than 100 let's let's run this program so
you can see it in action the program has
started it asks for an integer less than
100 will be annoying and put in 200 we
get another prompt that would be
annoying again and we could do this
forever
or not and now the program simply says
thank you for entering 190 that's the
most common reason really to use the do
loop for input validation and the reason
you need the do loop is simply you've
got to get at least one input from the
user
before you know whether to complain or
not so this is the situation where
you've got to enter the loop at least
once before you know what to do that's
exactly the point of the do loop the do
loop enters the loop at least once
whereas the while loop might never enter
the loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
