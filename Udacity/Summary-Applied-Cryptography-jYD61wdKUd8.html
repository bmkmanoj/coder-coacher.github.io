this brings us to the end of unit 2 our
main focus for unit 2 was how to use
symmetric encryption to solve problems
for the first part we focused on this
key they need to generate a random key
which is a very hard problem and we saw
that we could use physical randomness if
we had enough available to do this but
there's no way mechanically to produce a
perfectly random key but we could use a
pseudo-random number generator built
using encryption to take a small amount
of random data and amplify that to
produce more pseudo-random data and we
saw how to use a symmetric cipher to
take a small amount of random data
produce a sequence of values that appear
to be pseudo-random we also looked at
the problem of how to encrypt a large
file or a large message and that brought
us to look at modes of operation for
using symmetric ciphers and we talked
about the cipher block chaining mode the
counter mode and the cipher feedback
mode all of which have different
advantages and disadvantages we also
looked at how to do fair coin tosses
remotely and that led us to the need for
cryptographic hash functions and we saw
how to use those to check user passwords
in a way that doesn't require to keep
any secrets on the server and we also
saw how to use hash chains to make it so
those passwords never needed to be
reused the big problem we haven't
addressed yet is how to establish a
shared key if we want to use a symmetric
cipher to allow two parties to
communicate well they have to agree upon
the shared key beforehand if you think
about most ways we want to communicate
today that's very difficult if you visit
a secure website you don't have a shared
secret with them to begin with but you
want to start communicating securely
with them despite not having a shared
secret and for most uses of cryptography
today this is a really big problem we
can't assume that we have a shared
secret with every website that we want
to use we need some way to establish a
shared secret without having one to
begin with that's the main topic of unit
3 I hope to see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
