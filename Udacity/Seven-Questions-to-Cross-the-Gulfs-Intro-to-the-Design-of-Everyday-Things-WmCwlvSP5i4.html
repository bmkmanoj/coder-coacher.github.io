Gulf of evaluation involves users asking
themselves a series of questions for
each of the seven questions indicate
whether the question occurs at the
user's goal the action done to the world
the Gulf of execution or the Gulf of
evaluation what do I want to accomplish
or what is my goal what action can I do
now how do I do it and after I've taken
action what just happened what is what
just happen mean am i okay with what
just happened
have I accomplished my goal it's
important to note that typical behavior
is not about going through all stages in
a linear fashion we tend to weave back
and forth when trying to accomplish a
goal and not all of the activity in the
seven stages of action is conscious
goals tend to be conscious but even they
may be subconscious the seven stages of
action that are made up of the Gulf's of
execution and evaluation provide a
helpful checklist for designers to use
when creating something and next Don
introduces important design rules that
are linked to the seven stages of action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
