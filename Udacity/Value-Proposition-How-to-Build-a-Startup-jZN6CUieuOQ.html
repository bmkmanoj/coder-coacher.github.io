cover value proposition what is it
you're building and for who what pains
and gains are you creating for what
customer segments and more importantly
what's the Minimum Viable Product that
results from all this knowledge so
you're all familiar with the business
model canvas and hopefully by now you've
actually taken a shot and try to fill
out the canvas for your own idea in your
own startup but today we're going to
talk about the first box value
proposition value proposition is just a
fancy word in the business model canvas
for what is it that you're building what
product or service are you building and
by the way we're going to ask later for
who are you building it and what exactly
does it solve for those people so let's
take a look at value proposition as I
said it's not just about your idea or
product one of the things that's hard
for founders to realize there's actually
a customer at the other end and so while
you're thinking this is the greatest
thing since sliced bread
the whole idea about customer
development is to get you out of the
building and tell me whose need or
problem you're solving it's about
satisfying a customer need not just you
thinking what a great idea and that
can't be repeated enough so today well
we're talking about value proposition
value proposition works hand in hand
with who your customers are which we'll
be talking about in the next lecture
understand that this relationship
between what you're building the value
proposition and the customer is what
makes startup succeed or fail on day one
right there and we give that those two
boxes those two relationships a special
name we call that product market fit and
when you hear the phrase product market
fit just simply visualize the canvas and
go oh that's another fancy word that
says is what I'm building needed or
wanted or passionately desired by a set
of customers on the other end and if I
don't have that then the good news is
about the customer development process
is it allows us to keep
searching without going out of business
and so what you'll find is we'll be
iterating back and forth doing things
called pivots and iterations as we kind
of discover what customers really want
versus what we think we're building for
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
