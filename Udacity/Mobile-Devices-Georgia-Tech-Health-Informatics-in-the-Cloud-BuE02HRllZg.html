available from low-cost wearable devices
like the Fitbit Activity Monitor or even
sensors embedded in smartphones when
combined with apps on the phone they can
create a patient self-management system
that often includes the ability for
family members or caregivers to monitor
the status of an elderly relative
they're becoming more sophisticated over
time and the US Food and Drug
Administration is currently grappling
with the degree to which they should be
regulated as medical devices a live
course smartphone case that can monitor
a patient's heart beat is a good example
of a sophisticated device that has been
through the FDA process this process is
designed to assure things such as the
devices are safe they won't injure the
patient they accurately measure what
they claim as compared to earlier
devices they're manufactured properly
and that the manufacturer keeps records
so that patients with a potentially
defective device can be readily
identified</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
