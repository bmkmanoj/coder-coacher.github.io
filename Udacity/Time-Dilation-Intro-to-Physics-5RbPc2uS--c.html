given a name yet but we're going to call
time dilation you'll see why in a minute
and we have these equations relating the
rights of which different clocks tick
actually this number V over C I'm going
to stop writing V over C instead of
going to use this number or variable
beta to represent the ratio of a frame
speed to the speed of light and as long
as you're polishing things up let's go
one step further and instead of writing
T prime like this let's pull the T out
and give this quantity in parentheses
its own name and the name we're going to
give well we've seen alpha and beta it's
time for the next Greek letter is gamma
so now our complicated equation becomes
T prime equals gamma T so actually you
know what to understand what's going on
here we need to understand gamma a
little better so first let me tell you
without giving you much proof and I'm
sorry for doing that that V the speed
that we can move our that our frame of
reference can remove well it hasn't
upper bound it can't go any faster than
C can't go faster than the speed of
light so we can go as slow as 0 stopped
or up to the speed of light which means
that beta is between 0 and 1 so it can't
be equal to the speed of light I want
you to tell me what's the minimum and
maximum value for gamma so for gamma min
is the lowest possible value of gamma
was it as low as we want can it go to a
negative a billion is the lowest
possible value zero or as the lowest
possible value one likewise for give'em
max it's the highest possible value that
gamma can be is it 12 or can gamma max
grow as large as we want so it's two
questions select the best answer for
each</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
