know this information up front right at
the beginning of your pregnancy early on
is that something that's important to
you in the process was that something
you were happy to know about or do you
wish you kind of couldn't find out maybe
until later I'm going to skirt that a
little bit and I'm going to talk about
it in third person because it's such a
personal choice I'm going to tell you
that I have friends that have fallen
into all of these different categories I
have one friend that buried three babies
in five years because they kept coming
up with that twenty-five percent chance
I have one friend who has to advertise
children so they came up with that 25
the other twenty-five percent twice and
I have friends that have said well we'll
never get pregnant because we don't want
a dwarf child we went through so much
ourselves we would never want that for a
child I have friends that say I'm scared
to death of having an average-sized
child which I don't understand because I
teach high school you know that is not a
big deal and I have these great friends
in LA whose son is I just told you is
six foot four so you know this this
choice that we are now given access to
this technology maybe is is very very
powerful I'm going to tell you a quick
story we had a regional conference in
Los Angeles about a year ago three women
all in their 20s all kind of grew up
together by default I mean not
necessarily the same town but because
there have been little people of America
members all of their lives all pregnant
now they all have had the testing one of
them did not want to have the testing
for religious reasons but far along into
the pregnancy decided I don't want to go
through the baby showers I don't want to
decorate a nursery unless there's a
reason to so it's not going to change
anything about the pregnancy I'm going
to go through the pregnancy but I need
to know and so she knew she was carrying
a double-dominant and there she was with
a smile on her face with the other two
women
one of whom had already buried a
double-dominant and was on her second
try and knew that that one I believe was
going to be average size and in the
third young woman knew that she was
having a heterozygote dwarf and there
they were all happy and talking and I
just the strength that the girl had that
knew she had a double-dominant inside of
her was just amazing it gets a little
bit more sad so the baby lived a few
hours they waited the three months they
were told to wait they got pregnant
again and again had a double-dominant
and kept it and that's their own choice
and aren't we lucky in this country that
we have choices knowing everything you
know now as yourself and with the
current technologies even maybe thinking
about the possible advances in
technologies that will have in the
future in your lifetime or even possibly
you know beyond that would you change
would you choose to be different and
sort of as a variation of that you know
if you could choose this for your
children how would you I think Mike my
first answer is we call it the magic
pill you know if you had been able to
take a magic pill to not be a dwarf and
I think my response to that magic pill
would have been different depending on
what decade of my life you were asking
about I would most likely have taken
that magic pill in middle school and
probably high school prior to that I
don't think I really cared I was just a
kid I've never faced outright
discrimination in my job at Hunt's so I
think that magic pill may have been
taken between middle and high school but
after that you kind of get awfully
comfortable in your skin is do you think
it's harder to be born disabled or to
become disabled later on in your life
and the people that are really honored
and thinking I've actually it blows my
mind when they give me the answer that
I'm looking for which is this most
definitely it's harder to become
disabled because something has been
taken away from you with the exception
perhaps of being blind or deaf because
if you become blind later in life you
you know what things look like so you
can reference that when you can no
longer see them when if you become deaf
later in life you've learned how to talk
you can talk and I just I just want to
kiss them when they give me that answer
because they truly are thinking about it
and so when I think about our soldiers
that come home disabled I really feel
for them especially soldiers who were
big strong buff guys and girls and they
no longer are and that and I feel for
them and I'm so proud of them when they
turn that around and they become the
wounded warriors or the wheelchair rugby
team or something that they're putting
that energy and they're channeling it
into a different realm a positive realm
what what do you say to people who have
their own struggles and particularly
with your perspective how how would you
tell them to to what's the best way to
handle their struggle this is probably
trademarked but it does get better it's
a catchy phrase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
