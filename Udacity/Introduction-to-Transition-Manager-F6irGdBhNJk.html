4.4 kitkat
which introduced the scenes and
transitions API to see what's going on
behind the scenes let's look at a small
example when I tap this button the OS
executes a transition and needs to do a
couple of things first it needs to
capture the starting and end State for
every view in the scene and create an
animator that will interpolate between
the starting and end States so in this
case the end state is that the image is
gone the starting state is that the
image is visible so here's the code to
slide a view off the top of the screen
begin delayed transition takes a view
group and a transition type in this case
it's the root view in the slide
transition immediately after the call to
begin delayed transition transition
manager calls capture start States which
as the name indicates captures the start
states for all the views in the view
group before we've modified them after
that's done we modify the elements we
want to change or transition when the
frame is done transition manager calls
capture end States which does you
guessed it stores the end states of all
of the views in the view groups the
transition calls create animator with
these states creates an animator set and
executes sit the SDK comes with a bunch
of prefabricated transitions listed here
be mindful that all of them aren't
supported on all versions of Android so
if you require them you might be
excluding some users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
