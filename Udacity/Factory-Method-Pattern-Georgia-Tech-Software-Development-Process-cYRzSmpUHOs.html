pattern that we will discuss the factory
method pattern and I'm gonna start by
discussing the intent of the pattern and
its applicability as far as the infant
is concerned the factory method pattern
allows for creating objects without
specifying their class by invoking what
we call a factory method and what that
is is a method whose main goal is to
create class instances so when is this
pattern useful so when is it applicable
for example it is applicable in cases in
which a class cannot anticipate the type
of object it must create that is the
type of an object is not known at
compile time is not known until the code
runs a typical example of this are
frameworks so if you ever use the
framework you will know that normally
frameworks only know about interfaces
and abstract classes so the exact type
of the objects of these classes is only
known at runtime a second case in which
the factory method pattern is applicable
is when a class wants its subclasses to
specify the type of object it creates
and we'll see an example of this in a
minute
finally in factory model panners are
applicable when a class needs control
over the creation of its objects and in
this case a one possible example is when
there is a limit on the number of
objects that can be created a special
example it's a singleton if you're
familiar with the singleton singleton is
a class for which only one instance can
be created the factory method pattern is
perfect in this cases because it allows
to control how many objects get created
so in this case it would allow the
creation only of a single object and
from the second time and that it is
invoked it will just return the object
that was previously created let's go
ahead and see how this pattern actually
works and let's do that by discussing
the structure and the participants for
the pattern the structure that is
represented here using the UML notation
includes three classes the Creator the
concrete creator and the product the
Creator provides the interface for the
factory method so this here is the
interface for the factory method that
when invoked returns an object of type
product the concrete Creator provides
the actual method for creating the
product so this method is a concrete
implementation of this interface finally
the product is the object created by the
factory method so summarizing we have
the interface for the factory method the
actual
implementation of the summary method and
the object that is created by the
factory method when it is invoked so
let's look at an example of this pattern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
