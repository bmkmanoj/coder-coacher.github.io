based AI agents match methods to tasks
at the beginning this course we covered
several very powerful problem-solving
methods like generating test and
means-ends analysis but because they
were very powerful and very general they
also weren't necessarily the best for
solving any one problem we also covered
some more specific problem solving
methods like planning that addressed a
narrower set of problems but address
those problems very very well we also
covered several tasks in this class like
configuration and diagnosis and design
these tasks could all be carried out by
a variety of methods for example we can
imagine doing configuration with
generating test where we generate every
possible configuration of a certain plan
and then test to see which one's best we
could also do configuration by problem
reduction where you reduce the problem
down to the sub parts and solve them
individually and then compose them into
the overall solution in this way
knowledge-based AI agents match methods
to tasks in some cases we do the
matching we decide the generating test
is the best way to address this
diagnosis problem in other cases we
might design AI agents with their own
meta reasoning such that they themselves
can decide which method is best for the
task they're facing right now note that
this distinction between methods and
tasks is not always necessarily absolute
methods can spawn different subtasks so
for example if we're doing designed by
case based reasoning that spawns new
problems to address and we might address
those new problems as new tasks with
analogical reasoning orth problem
reduction this gets back to our meta
raising notion of strategy integration
in this way knowledge-based AI agents
match methods to tasks not only at the
top level but also at every level of the
task subtask hierarchy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
