we can be exposed to stressors and they
can be both pleasant and unpleasant like
vacations or marriage or death of a
loved one in both stressors can produce
negative emotional responses and
sometimes these negative emotional
responses can be difficult to control
and when we encounter a stressful
situation we engage in primary appraisal
which is our first reaction or
assessment of a situation however upon
experiencing the negative emotional
response produced by the stressful event
we can also engage in secondary
appraisal secondary appraisal is using
our self-assessment looking at the
resources available to help us cope with
the stressful event by engaging in
secondary appraisal we may be able to
reduce the level of negative emotions
that we experience so in the shower
handle example I showed you it nicely
demonstrates how I perceive the primary
event is very very stressful but upon my
secondary appraisal I was able to lower
my stress levels because I realized how
happy I was that the handle didn't break
off why the water was still running I
knew I really lucked out with that one I
also realized that things I needed to do
to make the problem go away such as
calling the plumber and this is a way of
coping with the situation so this again
demonstrates that it's a person's
perceived ability to deal with a
stressful event or stressor the results
in a negative emotional response to
stress if however I was a handy plumber
myself and the shower came off
I wouldn't perceive the event is
stressful at all I would just fix it
myself
because I would have the skills I needed
to solve the problem
now I might still be a little stressed
about the things I need to do to get the
handle fix but not as much as I could be
because I figured out how I want to
solve the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
