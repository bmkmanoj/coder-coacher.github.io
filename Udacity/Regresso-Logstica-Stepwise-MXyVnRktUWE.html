the hotel underscore log 1 this is where
we threw all the predictor variables
into the logistic regression trying to
predict that redeemer field and now what
we're going to do is still in a stepwise
tool the stepwise tool takes one input
from the logistic regression model
object and the other input from our
original estimation data set we now need
to name what we want to call the model
which I'll call stepwise underscore log
for a logistic stepwise regression now
as you can see like we mentioned before
there's different search directions we
can either use a backwards and forwards
search or backwards only by default I'm
going to choose the backwards and
forwards in combination now before
remember we mentioned that there is a
couple different ways to determine that
best of this stepwise model when it
should actually stop and that's off of
this AIC or the bi c values AIC is
generally accepted as a better measure
of model quality than BICS but however
the bi c is available to be used as a
quality measure if you want to but the
AIC is selected by default so I'm going
to keep it as that if you want to read a
little bit more about these you can find
some information about the AIC and the
bi see in the reading notes the last
thing I want to do is I want to bring it
up browse tool after this stepwise
regression report output now we're going
to click run and we're going to view the
output now what you can see in the
results is we have a very similar result
that we saw on the logistic regression
as you can see we removed the income
field and the customer segment field yet
we kept the large categorical variable
of region if we go to the bottom we can
see that the r-squared is quite similar
to that we saw before in the full
logistic regression that we first ran
yet we reduced many different variables
from this overall model we still have
many different variables that are still
statistically insignificant since they
don't have those stars over on the right
hand side now that you see how easy it
is to fill it out in a stepwise
regression I want to ask you to build
one out yourself in the next
