native JavaScript promises they started
showing up in browsers around the end of
2014 but polyfills for promises have
been around for much longer actually
jQuery which is a obviously a very
popular library implements its own
version of promises but they have some
serious issues so I definitely recommend
reading up on them in the instructor
notes if you want to use them the first
version of angular uses cue style
promises these are mostly the same as
native promises but have some slight
differences angular 2 however will
actually be taking advantage of native
JavaScript promises once again check the
links in the instructor notes to learn
more as of this filming right now in
December of 2015
native promises are safe to use with
every major browser except for Internet
Explorer and Opera Mini you'll need to
make sure that you include a polyfill or
some other kind of fall back on your
production sites there are some new API
s that are also taking advantage of
promises for instance they're the
recommended strategy for interacting
with the new serviceworker api service
workers are a total GameChanger they
allow you to add a powerful layer of
control between your app and the network
and that means that you can actually
create apps that work offline seriously
it's amazing and you should check the
instructor notes to learn more in the
next quiz you'll be using another new
API called the fetch API it uses native
promises to simplify XML HTTP a little
XML HTTP request that's really hard to
say substantially so let's go ahead and
do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
