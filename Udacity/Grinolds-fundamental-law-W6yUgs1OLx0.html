a method of relating performance skill
and breath and investing so for instance
you might be a very skilled investor
meaning that you can pick stocks well
but you might not have many
opportunities or breath to exercise that
skill so granola felt that there must be
some equation whereby we could combine
skill and breath to create an estimate
of performance he developed a
relationship he called the fundamental
law of active portfolio management I'm
going to state it here at the beginning
of the lesson and then spend the rest of
the list and trying to justify it and
show you why it makes sense and here's
his expression performance is equal to
skill times the square root of breadth
so we need some measure of skill and
some measure of breadth so if you want
to improve your performance you can
improve skill or you can find more and
more applications or methods or
opportunities for applying that skill so
as an example breath might relate to how
many stocks you invest in and skill
relates to your skill at choosing them
so again you can invest either in
improving your skill or in improving
your breath so performance is summarized
in something called information ratio
which is very much like the Sharpe ratio
that we've discussed before but it
refers to the Sharpe ratio of excess
returns in other words the manner in
which the portfolio manager is exceeding
the markets performance skill is
summarized in something called
information coefficient and breadth is
just how many trading opportunities we
have
okay so we'll expand on this more and
more as we go through the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
