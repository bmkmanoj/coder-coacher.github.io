that all these possibilities on the
Gaussian over here link to a gaussian
that lasts like this and this is a
really interesting two dimensional
Gaussian which you should really think
about clearly if you've also project
disc outs in uncertainty into the space
of possible locations I can't predict
the thing it's impossible to predict
where the object is and the reason is I
don't know the velocity also clearly if
I project this Gaussian into the space
of X dot and it's impossible to save
with the Rosset is a single observation
or a single prediction is insufficient
to make that observation however what we
know is our location is correlated to
the velocity the faster I move the
further on the right is the location and
this Gaussian expresses this if I for
example figure out that my velocity was
two and I was able under this Gaussian
to really nail that my location is V
that is really remarkable you still
haven't figured out where you are we
haven't figured out a fast be moving but
we've learned so much about the relation
of these two things with this tilted
Gaussian and to understand how powerful
this is
let's now fold in the second observation
at time T footstool this observation
tells us nothing about the velocity and
only something about the location so if
I were to draw this as a Gaussian it's a
Gaussian just like this which has me
something about location but not about
the velocity but if in our x prior from
the prediction step with the measurement
probability then me wrecklessly I get a
Gaussian that sits right over here and
this Gaussian now has a really good
estimate what my velocity is in a really
good estimate where I am if I take this
Gaussian and predict one step forward
then I find myself right over here
there's exactly the effect we have over
here as I update this I get a Gaussian
like this I predict right over here
think about this this is a really deep
insight in how common filters work in
particular
we've only been able to observe one
variable we've been able to multiple
observation to infer this other variable
and the way we've been able to infer
this that there's a set of physical
equations which say that my location
after time step is my old location plus
my velocity in this set of equation has
been able to propagate constraints from
subsequent measurements back to this
unobserved variable velocity so we're
able to estimate the rassa T as well
this is really key to understanding
Kalman filter it is key to understand
how Google self-driving car estimates
location of our cars and is able to make
predictions even if it's unable to
measure velocity directly so there's a
big lesson here the variables of a
comment later the often called States
because they reflect states of the
physical world like we as the other car
and our fastest-moving they separate
into two subsets the observables like
the momentary location and the hidden
which in our example is the velocity
which I can never directly observe but
because those two things interact
subsequent observations of the observer
variables give us information about
these hidden rables so we can also
estimate what these hidden variables are
so from multiple observations of the
places of the object location we can
estimate how fast it's moving
this is actually true for all the
different filters but because common
filters happen to be very efficient to
calculate when you have a problem like
this you tend to often use just a common
filter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
