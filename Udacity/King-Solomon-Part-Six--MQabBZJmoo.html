real but that's not that's not the truth
it could be the truth we didn't know
that all right we went to mechanism to
work either way that's right okay so all
right so let's go to the bottom again so
if if B is the real mom B has a value of
V real which is bigger than V fake which
is a vaise value hmm so when be
announces the value mm-hmm be probably
should announce be real mm-hmm because
again bees going to want to spend that
or wouldn't wouldn't want to not get the
baby having not spent that amount right
never regret for that and so b is going
to basically be truthful right and say
what what bees true value is which in
this case is V real at that point a has
a choice a can say yes and it's going to
have to pay more for the baby than the
baby's worth to a because V real is
bigger than be fake or say no and walk
away having paid the fine but begets the
baby but at a very high price but it
doesn't matter because F is still bigger
than 0 I see so now what you're saying
is so so that is a little bit weird and
asymmetrical right so B gets the baby
for v real but if if it was a who had
the baby then a is going to get the baby
for V fake which is less right but it
doesn't matter the point but your point
is that it because of this fact because
of the fact that if a lets it get this
far knowing that a is not the mom is
going to it's going to cost a defined
right and a will not get the baby so
that means a doesn't want it to get this
far which means when asked the question
having thought it all through mm a will
just say no so in fact by saying this is
the process we're going to go through
huh when asked the question both will be
truthful in fact all the questions will
be truthful all the way up to 2 question
1 what all the questions so any question
that's asked is going to be answered
truthfully by this design that's right
I'm sorry using all the way up to your
going counting backwards that's right no
well oh I see up to one yes up the
screen to one right so yeah that's
exactly right without knowing what V
real and VF a car but with everyone
understanding that the baby is valued
more by the real mother than the fake
mother this mechanism the set them in
such a way that it makes no sense for
the fake
other whoever it is to ever let it get
this far ever let it get to step 3 mmm
so as a result when forced to ask the
question the fake mother has to bail
kind of before it gets the three because
otherwise fake mom will lose clamor
therefore this mechanism will in fact
elicit the true values of the baby and
will allow King Solomon to know the
right thing because of this King Solomon
knows that they will answer truthfully
and we'll find out who the real mother
is and the only person who loses in this
is the poor person with a sword Oh again
I'm so sorry and there you go so I think
that that's a pretty interesting example
of how you might kind of do mechanism
design that is that is really
interesting yeah and so so I slipped in
and and called it a bid at one point
because it sort of reminds me of what
people do in auction design right when
when auctions are designed is often the
case that you want to set up an auction
so that people reveal their true values
for the for the goods that are available
and that yeah that they'll bid their
true values and that the winner you know
the one who valued the most will
actually end up winning at the end of
the day right you try to set up a
structure so that people will basically
pay what it is they really want or at
least we'll announce what it is that
they really want there are lots of
variations on this and in fact some
version very similar to this is sort of
what eBay does but without babies the
baby in this case is the prize you baby
you baby wait a second we have a website
let's go get rich I think that's illegal
big it depends but I was just going to
say that if you switch the A's to bees
and the bees 2 a's then eBay is baby I
do not understand how you do stuff like
that oh but I'm impressed all right okay
so here we are so yeah auction and by
the way you might think that this would
be a natural segue to talking about
auctions but that'll be our third class
that will never actually do seem fair at
least for being honest we're bidding our
true value that's true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
