character followed by a star or a
question mark that's a little more
complicated I won't ask you to do that
yourself
I'll show you let me walk you through
this first thing we're going to do is
we're going to break up the pattern into
three pieces the pattern was something
like a star exclamation point and so the
first part is P which is a single
character that comes before the star the
second part is the operator which is
either a star or a question mark and the
third part is the rest of the pattern
everything else after the star of the
question market that's two cases if the
operator is the star well we're gonna
just give up and call another function
here and we're gonna have to write that
function but rather than do it in line
we'll call it which we'll need because
it's going to be end up being a
recursive function so we'll call match
star which says match P any number of
times followed by pattern against the
text if the operator is the question
mark
then if we can match the first character
P against the text and match the rest of
the pattern after the question mark
against the rest of the text then we
return true but if we can't do that then
it's also okay if we can skip the first
character P not match the first
character P and go ahead and match the
rest of the pattern so this matches when
the first character matches this matches
when the first character fails that's
all there is to do with match but now we
have two promises to keep we have two
right match one and match star again
feel free to try them on your own if you
want but I'm going to go ahead and show
them to you match one is pretty easy so
we're matching a single character P
against the text if there is no text a
single character can't match against it
so we return false otherwise if the P
was a dot that matches anything so we
should return tree true or if the P is
exactly equal to the first character of
the text then we should return true now
here's match star we have a character P
we want to match any number of that zero
or more and then match the rest of the
pattern against the text so how can we
do that well
one way we can do it is by matching p0
times so that's just matching the
pattern against the text or we can match
p1 time against the text and then do a
match star of P followed by the pattern
against the rest of the text after the
first character notice that it wouldn't
do here to do a recursive call to match
we want a recursive call to match star
so because we want to say we're matching
either exactly zero times or one time
followed by zero or more times that's it
and if we go ahead and run the test and
print out the results we find that all
the tests pass and I should say that the
subset of the regular expression
language and the approach we use to
solve it I owe a lot to rob Pike who
wrote a very nice essay on how to do
this and here's a URL link to it and
you'll be seeing Rob in an interview at
the end of this class in in the final
unit so that should give you some idea
of what regular expressions are how to
write programs to process them and a
little bit of the power of what they can
do now in this program a regular
expression was just a string and it was
easy to deal with because all we had to
deal with was the first character of the
string the second character of the
string and so on but regular expressions
can get more complicated they can have
nested structures that are more like
trees than strings and so in the rest of
this unit we'll be dealing with an
internal representation of regular
expressions based on trees that will be
different from this you can still have
inputs in the form of strings that gets
translated to into into trees but we'll
be dealing with the tree structure from
now on so this should give you an intro
and a review that's good enough to
handle the rest of the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
