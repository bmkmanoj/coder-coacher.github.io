command printf is a shell command for
printing formatted strings if I run it
on its own it just prints out what I've
put here which is an HTTP request you
can print if anything like this it's
kind of like echo but it's a little
smarter it can do things like turn back
slash and into a line break whereas echo
would just print out the backslash hands
by themselves and NC stands for netcat
and it's a handy tool for manually
talking to Internet services here i'm
giving a command that will connect to
the Wikipedia web server but NC doesn't
know anything about HTTP in particular
instead of Wikipedia I can use it to say
hello to the local host SSH server on
port 22 I can't speak SSH personally but
can't see what it says or we could use
it to say hello to an email server such
as gmails we get little greeting here
from google com smtp which is the email
protocol so we'll be using NC or netcat
as a sort of network Swiss Army knife to
connect to various servers and later
even to act as a server itself now let's
take another look at this here in the
middle the vertical bar here is a pipe
it's the standard UNIX way to say take
the output of this program and feed it
in as the input of that program so we're
taking the output of printf which is a
string that forms an HTTP request and
we're using that as the input to NC NC
takes that input and sends it over the
network to the address and port that we
tell it to and displays the output</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
