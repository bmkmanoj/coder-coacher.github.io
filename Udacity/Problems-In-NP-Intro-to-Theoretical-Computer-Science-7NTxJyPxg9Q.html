together and just look at the problems
that are in NP then there's a lot of
different possibilities for the
properties of that problem so either the
problem if it's an NP could be in P or
this NP complete or it might even be
something else now we haven't really
talked about this something else here
but there are some problems which are
believed to be somewhere in between P
and NP at least if P does not equal NP
of course one example here for example
would be factoring to large numbers now
if your problem is np-complete there are
still very very many possibilities your
problem could be fixed parameter
tractable your problem could have an
approximation algorithm and that
approximation algorithm might either be
a Pete as a constant factor
approximation algorithm or also
something else and again we haven't
really talked about this something else
but for example there are some
approximation algorithms where you can
have a logarithmic approximation factor
and then there are randomized algorithms
Monte Carlo algorithms and Las Vegas
algorithms and there's many many other
things that we haven't touched upon so
really a lot of different complexities
now one final thing I should mention
there are two notions here especially if
you talk to somebody who has studied
theoretical computer science they will
nitpick you about the NP completeness
because NP completeness is technically
only defined for a decision problems so
if you're talking about optimization
problems and you want to be very correct
then you should call that problem an
np-hard problem but many people use
these terms interchangeably and actually
when you're working in practice on hard
problems it doesn't really make much of
a difference at least in my opinion but
it's not the most precise way to say it
so decision problems NP complete
optimization problems NP hard what would
happen if we were able to show that P
equals NP would then each single class
we have shown here become p or would the
classes separate and what I mean by this
is could we then show that not every NP
complete problem is fixed parameter
tractable or not every NP complete
problem has an approximation algorithm
and more than one of these here can be
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
