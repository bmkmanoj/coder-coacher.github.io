value inequality did you get negative
seven to nine if so great work let's see
how we got that answer when I see an
absolute value with the less than I know
that we're going to have an intersection
which is going to leave us one region to
solve this absolute value inequality I
can set it up as a compound inequality
negative 2 is less than or equal to X
minus 1 over 4 which is less than or
equal to 2 so here's our two cases we
have negative 2 is less than or equal to
X minus 1 over 4 and we have X minus 1
over 4 is less than or equal to 2 we can
solve this compound inequality all at
one time first thing I want to do is
clear my fraction to clear my fraction
i'm going to multiply through by the
least common denominator which is for
when i multiply through by four i have
to multiply 4 by negative 2 which gives
me negative 8 and it multiply 4 by x
minus 1 over 4 which gives me x minus 1
and i have to multiply 4 times 2 which
is eight the next thing i need to do is
isolate the X in the middle so I have to
add 1 to all three parts and i get
negative 7 is less than or equal to x
which is less than or equal to 9 and I
can draw this on a number line if this
is 0 and this is 9 and this is negative
7 we know that X has to be greater than
or equal to negative 7 and X has to be
less than or equal to 9 so I fill in the
region in the middle and that gives me
the interval from negative 7 to 9 with
closed brackets remember we use closed
brackets when we have less than or equal
to or greater than or equal to let's try
another one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
