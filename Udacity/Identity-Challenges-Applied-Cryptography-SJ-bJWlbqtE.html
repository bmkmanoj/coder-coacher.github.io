Alice spends a bill to see how to solve
the double spending problem so at the
end of this protocol Alice will have a
message like this where each one of
these identity pairs is one of those
pairs of hashes to spend the bill
Allison's to build a Kathy and Kathy
sends a challenge back to Alice and what
the challenges is a list of em random
bits these will tell Alice which parts
of the identity she needs to open so in
order for calc knee to accept the bill
what Alice has to do now is for each one
of these validate one part of the hash
so if Kathy's challenge bit was zero
what Alice has to provide is is the zero
part of identity one and remember what
identity one is is the hash of the zero
part of identity one concatenated with a
hash of the one part where the property
we need is that these two values X or
Dallas if the challenge is 1 then i'll
send the one part of the corresponding
identity and so on so now Kathy can
validate these hashes so she's going to
check that this matches the value sent
by Alice and we'll do that for all the
identities if they all match Kathy
accepts the bill when she deposits it
she sends these I values to the bank so
suppose Alice tries to spend the bill
again this time she'll send it to Doug
Doug will do the same protocol he'll
make a challenge send that challenge to
Alice get back foot I values but they'll
be the ones corresponding to his
challenge and he'll do the same check
before accepting the bill and now Doug
can deposit the bill sending along the
same I values so now what does the bank
have well it has both parts of one of
the I values as long as one of these
challenge bits is different the bank
knows there was double spending because
it saw our K value twice it also knows
the identity of the person who obtained
that bill because it can X or the 0 part
of identity 1 which have received from
Kathy when she deposited the bill with
the one part of that identity which the
bank received from Doug when he
deposited the bill so now the bank can
tell the police to arrest Alice for
double spending a bill so to see that
you understand all this the question is
if Alice spends a bill twice
and M the number of identities included
in the bill is 10 what's the probability
that she gets caught</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
