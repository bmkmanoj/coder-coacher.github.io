orders that he had gotten from the
school and from mr. Belvedere but in the
end he finally had a moment to relax he
had visions of little children running
around with glasses wipers and nozzles
and of course of his new friend what a
nice old man he felt so excited and so
satisfied that pretty soon his products
be keeping the classes of people all
over the world nice and clean but he
realized he'd left out one major detail
he hadn't yet set the price for his
wipers or for his nozzles in terms of
the equation that we came up with for
his total future earnings he hadn't
picked a value for W yet or 14 n
remember that W equals the price per
wiper blade set and n is just equal to
the price per nozzle grant thought long
and hard about how much he wanted to
charge for each wiper blade set and for
each nozzle but finally he came to a
decision he set the price per wiper
blade set at thirty dollars and he set
the price per nozzle at twelve dollars
now these might look like kind of steep
prices but hey green had worked really
hard on both of his products and they're
actually pretty intricate designs takes
a lot of work to make nozzles and wipers
this small that aren't just going to
break their first use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
