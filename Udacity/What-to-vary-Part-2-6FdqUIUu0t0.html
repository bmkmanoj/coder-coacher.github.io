duplication quite a bit but for more
targeted layout adaptations we can get
even more fine-grained using all those
resource qualifiers we learned about we
can vary everything from number of
columns to heights and widths to margins
and spacing and beyond let's take a look
you could use the w 600 DP qualifier to
vary an integer resource changing the
number of columns in a grid of items an
integer resource is basically a number
with no units like pixels or DP or
anything like that on a phone you could
have one column which is basically the
same as a vertical list and on a tablet
or with the W 600 DP qualifier we could
bump it up to three columns this
approach works for both grid view and
the grid based layout manager is bundled
with recyclerview when switching from a
list type presentation to a grid you'll
likely want to use a different layout
for each item to do this you can access
your column count integer resource from
code in your adapter and use that to
decide which layout to inflate it's
worth noting that in addition to integer
resources there are also boolean
resources so you could have a boolean
like multi-column which defaults to
false but in w 600 DP gets set to true
and then you could decide to use a tile
versus a card type list presentation
another super powerful technique is to
just very specific metrics like paddings
margins or even button widths and
Heights here's our same UI but this time
we're defining the toolbar and content
view once and specifying Heights and
margins that change on a 600 DP wide
screen this technique is really really
powerful and lets you minimize code
duplication quite a bit here's another
example a full with button on a phone
might get too wide past 400 DP so you
can create a dimension resource called
button width that's match parent on a
phone in exactly four hundred DP once
the screen width is larger using the w
400
qualifier note that simply typing match
parent wont work in dimension resources
because it's a special value negative
one that doesn't have any units here's a
quick trick that works around that
limitation just put this item tag in
your dimensions file that's equivalent
to the integer value negative one then
you can reference it in other dimension
values like so using at domen match
parent and hey remember key lines from
once and three on smaller devices the
standard key lines are sixteen dip and
seventy-two dip but once you get to
larger sizes you can start using the
standard tablet key lines of 24 dip and
80 dip this too can be done with varying
dimension resources in this example
we're telling the toolbar to inset the
title from the left edge of the screen
to the second key line so we're going to
inset it by 72 or 80 dip depending on
which device we're running on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
