set your marketing goals you don't want
to waste your time on things that you'll
do nothing with later this is why
setting your goals is so important
consider this please tell me which way
to go from here that depends a good deal
and where you want to go I don't care
much where then it doesn't much matter
which way to go
you're sure enough to get somewhere if
only you walk long enough you need the
goals that are realistic and attainable
it's fine to spend a few minutes

answer here but we still encourage you
to try it if you don't have your own app
