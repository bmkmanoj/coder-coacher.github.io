Hellman key exchange algorithm first we
observe that the shear key meaning the
shear secret that is computed by both
users a and B itself is never
transmitted further the local secret of
user A or B itself is also not
transmitted that is the local secret XA
is kept to user a and this local secret
XP is kept to user be in summary no
secret value is being transmitted on the
other hand the values yaa and YB are
transmitted then the question is from
why a which is alpha raised to the power
of X a mark you and given that alpha and
q and why a unknown can anniversary
compute XA the security assumption here
is that this good logarithm when large
number is involved is very hard that is
given y alpha and q it is extremely hard
to compute the value of x or it is not
practical to compute X because Q is very
large prime for example q is ellie's 300
bit long on the other hand if this
conjecture is not true that means
anniversary knowing why a and knowing
alpha and q can easily compute XA which
is the local secret to user a this would
mean that the adversary can compute a
sheer secret key as they shared between
user amb that's like user a because now
the adversary knows the local secret of
user a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
