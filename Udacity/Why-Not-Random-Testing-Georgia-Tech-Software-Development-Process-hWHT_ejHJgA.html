pick our test the inputs randomly so to
do what what it's called random testing
and what that means is that we pick the
inputs to test just as we pick a number
by running a set of dice randomly and
this will have several advantages first
we will pick inputs uniformly so if we
use a uniform distribution as the basis
for our random testing we will make no
preferences in other words all inputs
will be considered equal of equal value
and what that means in turn is that
random testing eliminates designer bias
so what does designer bias mean designer
bias is the problem of making the same
assumption when we read the
specification and we interpret it and
when we develop test cases which means
that the developer might develop code
assuming a given behavior of the user
and we might write tests making the same
assumptions and the problem of course is
even worse if it's the same person that
develops the code and writes the test
cases with random testing the problem is
gone because we just pick randomly what
our inputs will be so why not doing
random the problem is that when testing
we are looking for a needle in a
haystack actually multiple needles in
multiple haystacks if we want to be
precise so random approaches are not
necessarily the best way to go about it
because we might just be looking in all
the wrong places so let me show you this
using a different representation for the
haystack what I'm showing here is a grid
and imagine this grid just expanding
indefinitely outside the screen and this
grid represents the domain for the
program so each box in the grid it's
squaring the grid it's a possible input
so what happens with bugs is that bugs
are very scarce in this grid maybe there
is a bug here so that means that there
is a bug that an input in this point
will reveal and maybe there is another
bug that will be triggered by an input
over here so imagine this spread out
over this infinite grid it's very
unlikely that just by picking randomly
we will be able to get to these two
points fortunately not all is lost
there is a silver lining so we need to
look a little bit more depth into this
grid</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
