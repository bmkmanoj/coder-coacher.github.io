to work well we need a mapping we need
encryption to be invertible given that
the output is mod n we have output
values that the possible values here
would be from 0 to n minus 1 we need to
know that this mapping Maps each message
to a unique ciphertext otherwise they
wouldn't be invertible if two messages
mapped to the same value then we
wouldn't know which to decrypt to that
would definitely be the case if we have
more than the modulus number of values
that would mean that we've wrapped
around and we've definitely used one at
least twice but as long as m and n are
relatively prime
we should generate all the different
values so we can use each of these as
different messages but we should be very
careful what if the value M is 0 if M is
0 no matter what the exponent is we
still get 0 as our result that's not a
very good encryption function if the
result doesn't depend on the key same
thing if M is 1 we still get 1 as the
output and in fact it's dangerous for
any small value to use this encryption
and one reason you can see that and
we'll talk more about this later is the
key is public we're assuming that the
adversary knows e so if there's only a
small possible set of m values the
adversary can just try them all and see
which one maps so it's very dangerous to
use a small m as the input message for
RSA we'll talk more about that later
but first I want to talk about why RSA
is correct and then why we think it's
secure at least ones used in a very
careful way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
