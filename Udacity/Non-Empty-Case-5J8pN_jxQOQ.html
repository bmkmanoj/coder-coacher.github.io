we have to consider the the case in
which the vectors do have elements and
we're going to also break this down into
two more cases depending on whether or
not the first elements of x and y are
identical ok so the first case is yes
they are identical so in this case
determining whether x and y our
permutation boils down to whether or not
the tales of X and the tale of why are
permutations of each other and the tail
of a vector is everything except the
first element so we could say that for
this case in order for the output to be
a permutation on the input the syntax on
the that you see on the slide holds in
particular that says if the length of x
is greater than 0 that's our special
case and our second special case was
that the value in the first position of
x is equal to the value of the first
position in Y and the third condition is
if the permutation if the tail of X is a
permutation of the tail of Y then we can
conclude that in fact x and y are
permutations of each other so what we're
doing now we handle the case where they
were empty vectors and said they were
permutations and in this case if these
three conditions hold they are
permutations ok the other thing to note
is that what we've defined here is a
recursive definition now I warned you
before about recursive definitions often
leading to cases where the definition is
not meaningful now here I'm going to
give you a specific situation which you
are allowed to do that and we're allowed
to do that because it essentially is an
inductive argument ok the permutations
that we're using in our definition are
permutations on the tales of the input
and output ok and the tails are
everything but the first element and so
they're shorter and we also already have
handled the case where we got down to
zero length so we handled zero length
and we handled everything in terms of
its tail we have a well-founded
induction here and so in fact our
definition of permutation is in fact
meaning
we couldn't say that X is a permutation
of y if x is a permutation why ok that
wouldn't be a meaningful induction but
here because we're shrinking it at every
step it is in fact a meaningful
induction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
