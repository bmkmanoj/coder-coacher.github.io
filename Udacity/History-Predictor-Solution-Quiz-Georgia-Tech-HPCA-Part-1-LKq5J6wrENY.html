history predictor quiz in C a loop exits
at the beginning so the first loop will
do something like initialize I to 0 if I
is equal to 8 jump to done otherwise do
everything that is needed for an
iteration of the outer loop and then
branch back here the inner loop will
just do J equals 0
and then if J is equal to 8 go to some
label D 1 do something jump back here
and the label D 1 would really be here
after which we are going like this so
how many entries do we need we need at
least one entry per branch although in
fact we need one entry for each
instruction but at least we need to have
entries for branches so we have a branch
that does this here we have a branch
that does this here we have a loop back
branch here and we have a loop back
branch here so we are talking about at
least four entries in reality we need
many many more in order to do well on
all four of these branches we need to
see what is the longest history that any
one of them will have the loop at branch
is always taken so really we don't even
need a history for it even a single two
bit counter will do well on these two
but this one will be testing eight times
for 0 through 7 and stay in the loop and
then the 9th time it tests it jumps out
so really it has a pattern of length 9
which means we need an 8 bit history
with an 8 bit history we need 2 to the
8th 2 bit counters so that leads to 256
2 bit counters now what is the pattern
of this branch here it really is 8 times
it's not taken followed by a taken and
that repeats the inner branch does
exactly the same thing except it does it
many more times so if you look at how
many possible patterns we actually have
of length 8 we have a pattern of 8 not
Takens
we have a pattern of 7 not Takens
followed by a taken
we have a pattern of six not taken then
taken not taken etc so we are really
using only nine of these two bit
counters which again shows that a
predictor of this type with a very long
history will waste a lot of its many
many entries</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
