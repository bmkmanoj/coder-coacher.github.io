Eastern North Carolina in a really small
rural community about 50 minutes south
east of raleigh in a little town called
Grantham I was raised as an only child
my dad was a sheriff's deputy my mom was
a stay-at-home mom we lived a pretty
country a rural life you know we never
really traveled outside of the state and
I grew up as an only child thinking my
parents were my real parents which I
still classify them as my real parents
but yeah I didn't really any think think
anything about it until I got a little
bit older and sort of realized that you
know I don't really look like my parents
how old were you when that when that
happened uh I was probably you know
probably 11-12 when I sort of noticed
you know my parents have different body
shapes than me I always just sort of
wondered you know why is that and sort
of just put it to the back of my mind
although I didn't notice that my friends
parents and their siblings looked more
similar than I look to my parents mm-hmm
but again I didn't really question it
because I didn't really think anything
of it but that was really the only
exposure I had I never really understood
you know growing up what adopted mint
just because sex is not talking about a
lot in Eastern North Carolina and the
understanding of you know where you come
from from your biological parents wasn't
really ever brought up so the concept of
being adopted also wasn't ever brought
up so how old were you when you finally
actually sort of figured it out or
someone talk to you about it so it was a
really interesting story I was 14 and
like most people in Eastern North
Carolina was raised in the church church
was a big facet of everyone's life and I
went to Sunday school one day I was 14
and coincidentally was Father's Day
and in church that day in sunday school
lesson the teacher was talking about how
whenever you become adopted or whenever
you become a Christian you become
adopted into gods family and he then
looked at me and he said so why don't
you tell the class what it feels like to
be adopted sterling and that sort of
struck me so I had never heard that I
was adopted before like I said I've
thought that you know I look a little
bit different than my parents and then I
saw pictures of me as a baby with my
parents and so you know I just thought
about it on saying no I can't be adopted
and I remember there was a girl a
distant cousin of mine who said sterling
sada dot did those are his real parents
and so I sort of squashed it in church
although there was this rumbling anxiety
within me and then I went to the sermon
portion of church and I SAT between my
grandmother and my refer to as me ma and
my mama on the other side and I'll
leaned over to my meemaw and I was like
so am i adopted and she didn't look at
me she looked kept looking straight at
the pulpit and she's like you're gonna
have to ask your mother about that and
so then I turned to my mom and I was
like so I heard in something school that
I'm adopted and she's like well you are
and I just sort of froze right there in
the pew and I just wasn't shocked I
didn't really react your first and then
I just started tearing up and crying and
stood up and just sort of left I think
it's one of the sort of disadvantages in
a way of being adopted is this notion of
survivor's guilt where there's a big
disaster this is where the term came
from originally I believe there's a big
disaster and those that survived the
disaster feel guilty because they're not
the ones that been injured or killed and
when you're adopted you feel like I was
chosen you know
my parents for there are plenty other
people who are still in the foster care
system who weren't adopted and you feel
like you should be grateful you know
that you were adopted and you should be
thankful every day that you live that
you have a family that you know raised
you and supported you and and I am
thankful but you know anytime I question
being adopted who my biological parents
are that's like a twinge of guilt how
did that make you think about your
biological parents once you discover
this information what was going through
your mind about you know the scenario in
which you found yourself did you have
questions yeah I mean I think there's a
lot of fantasy that goes on with you
know who they could be like are they
like me do they act like to me do they
talk like me what are their professions
like what if it's like you know I
remember when I was a teenager like what
if it's like some European like royal
family who like ships their child off to
North Carolina and was reared by you
know some really awesome southern
parents that obviously came to mind also
like what if they're in jail or you know
you know not even live like you know
that that came into mind so I was just
always curious as to what they were what
they were like and also what was the
situation that led them to having to put
up a child for adoption I'm also just
sort of curious about their lives like
what do they like if I have any siblings
or not I mean that's always a question
of mine if there are any health
considerations you know there's a lot of
health diseases medical diseases that
have a huge genetic component and like
knowing that information is important to
me you know it's part of participation
we've offered you an opportunity to
actually submit a DNA sample and find
out you know if they're in the 23andme
program if you might find any genetic
relatives of yours you know what are
your thoughts surrounding that you've
you've submitted your DNA you submitted
your sample but you haven't seen your
ulch yet you know what are some thoughts
going into that about participating in
the program like that and what you
expect to see what you expect to find
and how that might make you feel you
know to be honest I thought about it too
much because again that fantasy play of
you know finding my biological parents
like finding the DNA that may match with
mine and seeing what percentage the
similarities are and being able to
contact them I don't want to disappoint
myself because I know that the the
highest likelihood is that there's
probably going to be some distant
distant cousin that has similar DNA to
me so I'm not really putting a whole lot
of stock until as far as finding
somebody but I am interested in seeing
you know the other facets of my DNA that
23andme will sort of alyssa days such as
risk for medical diseases and
pharmacological sort of ability to
metabolize drugs and respond to them
think that's a part of it and just
generic ancestry stuff are you excited
to see your 23 Emmy a result I am I am
I've been holding out they've actually
been available for a little bit now but
for the purposes of the interview I've
sort of held back I'm waiting on the
edge of my seat to see what they say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
