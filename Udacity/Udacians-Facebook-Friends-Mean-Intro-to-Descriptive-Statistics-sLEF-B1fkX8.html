do before we end this lesson as I said
before it's really important to know how
to use technology and that's why we had
you create a Google account so that we
can easily share real data with you to
analyze I asked all my co-workers here
at Udacity how many Facebook friends
they have and then I put this data for
you in a spreadsheet open this
spreadsheet and then copy and paste the
data into a new spreadsheet and then try
and find the average number of Facebook
friends I'll help you get started and
any of the blank cells we always start
our calculations with in equals there's
already a built-in function called
average that calculates the average so
you can write this and the spreadsheet
software will recognize that you're
trying to take the average then in
parentheses write your start cell which
is the letter and then the number that
corresponds to the location of that cell
for example C 32 then you'll put a colon
because you want to include all the
cells in between the start cell and the
end cell and then finish it off with
your end parenthesis and then push Enter
or return
this should give you the average once
you find it using the spreadsheet tell
us what you found what's the average
number of Facebook friends that my
coworker is at Udacity have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
