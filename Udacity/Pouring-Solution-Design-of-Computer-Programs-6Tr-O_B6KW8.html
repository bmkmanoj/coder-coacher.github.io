coding it up but before I do that I want
to introduce one more piece of jargon
which is if I'm at a particular state
and I decide that that's the one that's
the endpoint of the path that I want to
expand and I come up with the states you
can get to from there by expanding the
path and the steps that it takes to get
to those states I call that the
successors to this state so the
successors is a collection of states
that you can reach and the steps that it
took to get there here's my solution
it's a little bit complicated so let's
go through it step by step I'm saying
the input to this poor problem function
are x and y which are the capacity of
the glasses using capital x and y for
that then the goal which is going to be
an integer like 6 to say that's how much
I'm trying to get to and that can be in
either one of the glasses and then the
start state which I'm defaulting to 0
and 0 saying both glasses have current
level 0 but if you wanted you could
generalize the problem and pass in
something else as what we're starting
with and I'm using lower case X and
lower case Y to indicate the current
capacity of the glasses so here I check
and see are we done
before we even get going did you you
know give me a start state and said well
the goal is to have a glass with the 0
in it then we're done before doing any
actions so go ahead and return that and
what I'm gonna return is called a path
and the path is an alternation of states
and then an arrow which will give a name
to each action and then the other state
that it goes to and we alternate out
with States action States and so on so
here if there's nothing to do it's just
a state with no actions we're going to
keep track of the states that we've
already explored and that's going to be
a Sat we're going to keep track of the
frontier and conceptually that's a set
to but we're gonna pull the items off of
the frontier one at a time and so I've
made it an ordered list rather than a
set so I know which element of the
frontier do I want to explore
first and so a frontier the explored is
a set of states than the frontier is an
ordered list of paths and the only path
we have so far is the trivial path that
says we're starting at the start and we
haven't gone anywhere else yet so that's
what we start our frontier with while
the frontier is left while there's still
frontier States we haven't explored from
yet we pop off the first one so pop of
zero says take the 0th element of the
list so we're going to pull elements off
of the front of the list and push them
on to the end of the list then say the
current state is the last element of the
path so the path goes from one state to
the next and the last element of the
path is the current state so let's take
x and y from there then I've defined a
successor function that gives me all the
successor states and the actions we had
to get we use to get from there so there
should be six of those and then if we
say if that new state is not explored
then it's something new if it was
explored there's nothing left to do
we've already explored from there if it
hasn't been explored yet then add it to
the explored set make up a new path
which consists of the old path plus we
follow an action to get to the new State
if the goal number is somewhere in that
state so the goal is six and the state
is the two levels of the other classes
say six and three yes six is in six and
three then we're done we turn that path
as the the winner the path of each the
goal otherwise just add this path on to
the frontier and we'll pull out
something off of the frontier later and
if we go all the way through and we run
out of frontiers to explore from then we
can't reach the goal and we return fail
you could have failed be nun I decided
to make it be the empty list because all
the other things we were returning were
lists either way none or fail both are
equivalent defaults in Python if
statements so probably either one would
do fine and here's my successor function
so it takes the current levels of the of
the glasses and the maximum capacity of
the glasses and what it's going to
return is a dictionary of state action
and the state is just an XY pair of what
are the levels of the glass is going to
be and the action is how you got there
and we're just going to use strings to
represent those actions so that's just
something that we can print out there
otherwise unimportant in the operation
of the program and first I wanted to
check this this is a legal state that
the the fill level of X is less than its
capacity and same for Y and then I said
here are the six possibilities and the
the pouring is complicated let's do the
filling first so the filling says in
fill X up to its its capacity capital X
you can fill Y up to its capacity
capital Y you can empty X that'll become
zero you can empty Y it will become 0
and then the fill there's two cases if
the total amount of water is less than Y
then you can take all the water in in
the first class which is X and add it
into Y so you get y plus X same thing in
the in the other direction but if the
total amount of water is more than the
destination that you're trying to pour
it into then you can only fit pour as
much as will fill up the other glass and
we can see that this there's
conservation of water here the total
amount is X plus y minus this difference
plus this difference and I got the
definition of my program pretty much
just by following out the implications
of this diagram that we're going to keep
track of an explored set never try to
return there expand a frontier pop off
one element of the frontier add in the
new elements and check when we get to
the goal and then that was all kind of
generic for any exploration problem and
then for the specific water problem the
successor function and the way that was
laid out that was specific to what we're
doing with the glasses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
