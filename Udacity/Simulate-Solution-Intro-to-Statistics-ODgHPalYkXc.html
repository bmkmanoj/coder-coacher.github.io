randint to assign the true location of
the car and my initial guess called
guess one is also chosen at random and
you see these independent random choices
with equal probability and now there's
two possibilities either truth is
equivalent to gas or it isn't when truth
is equivalent to guess Monty will pick
one of the two other doors
Trista's implement this I would litter
Monty pick a random door using randint
and of course he might have picked the
correct door which contains the car
which is also my guess and when that's
the case I just rerun the random number
generator until it finally finds a door
that is not the true door or actually
not the guess and that's his pick so if
you look carefully this might run a
number of times but when returns he
picked one of the remaining doors with
50% chance in the else clause the truth
and my guests are not the same so Monty
now is to pick the remaining door with
probability 1 how do you get Monty's
choice now I'm going to do a little cute
trick I know that the sum of all doors
one plus two plus three plus six so if I
subtract from six the truth and my guess
I get the third door
so this equation six - truth - guess
will give us the number of the door that
isn't truth and isn't guess one to flip
my door I cannot do the same trick I did
over here I picked the one that was my
initial guess which is a subtract guess
one from six pick the one that isn't
Monty so it gives me guess
- and if that guess is the same as the
two door I increment K by one then I
return the final number over here so
this gives me a single simulation of
undo this n times so I add a loop for I
in range n move everything to the right
a little bit and then the simulation is
run n times
returning my desired ratio of the
successes over the total number of
experiments so let's run it well now one
at a thousand times they get a number
like 0.67 - there's not exactly 2/3 but
obviously there's some randomness
involved in the simulation if I increase
n to 10,000 I get a number of slightly
closer to 0.66 do it 400,000 I get zero
point six six seven four eight and that
is awfully close to 2/3 so
really interesting to see that the
switching helps put differently say I
use guess one as my final gets to
compare to the truth as opposed to guess
two and run this I get 0.33 one and the
interesting thing about gets one is the
reason why it works is all the code from
if truth all the way to here guess two
is now irrelevant so I can comment all
of this out here in the middle which
I've just done and just retain the
assignment of the truth which is a
random number assignment of guess one
which is a random number and then I'll
just check where these two agree and
clearly the probability must be a third
all the story about showing the open
door has no effect on this and that
little thing yeah that assimilated it
and when every 10 the original guess
that all the story about open door has
no effect on the chances of my guess
prove if the chances to be a third for
the original door and therefore
switching Gotha to 2/3
isn't that cool so this is the story of
Monty Hall and the very famous quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
