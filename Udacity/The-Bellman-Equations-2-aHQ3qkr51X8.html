of a bellman equation to bellman
equations and the way we're going to do
that is by noting that in that previous
derivation the way that we're thinking
about things is we capture this V here
as the repeating structure that starts
with the max max a right mm-hmm so it's
actually this piece this sort of
infinite piece here so the the whole V
consists of this sort of sub V in it and
this is why this piece gets substituted
with the V in the equation right yeah
that makes sense when you have an
infinite number of these things going on
forever and ever and I noticed an
infinite number of left parenthesis and
not enough right parenthesis oh no this
right bracket has traditionally
represented the balancing of all left
parenthesis all right that's that's from
Lisp yeah it's just a shorthand nice
nice little lip this see this nice nice
Lisp reference Thanks so but the thing
is because this is an infinite sequence
that's there's actually a number of
other ways that we can group this
infinite sequence so let me draw another
one okay so we can also group the
infinite sequence here and notice that
it repeats like this so this expression
after the max the starting from the R
and then moving forward repeats again
here and so we can actually make a new
equation that depends on that
substructure repeated so let me write
that out so the idea is that we can
actually just give a name to this big
outer brace so we'll call it Q si and
we'll say that it's equal to R si plus
the discount factor times the sum over
next possible States the probability of
getting there time yeah times max a 2 or
next max of and then there's that
repeating structure again so we can just
plug in Q of s prime a prime for that
this gives us another bellman equation
that instead of starting at the s point
kind of starts after the action has
started well wait if it starts after the
action has started why isn't in Q of a
ah okay that's a fair question so if how
could we have written the Q value of an
action the Q value at this point in the
sequence this way
that rate the reward for leaving that
state and taking that action plus the
discounted but you know value of the
future what's what's a problem with this
well I see two problems one is kind of
mathematical and one is sort of
semantics so mathematically it doesn't
make sense because where the S come from
in our FS come a yeah this is an unbound
variable right so that's an error we
can't have that and the second is when
you actually
write it that way if so here you're
arguing that Q is like B yeah right
so you asked me what the quality U and a
is but the value of an action is
meaningless except in the presence of
the state where you're taking an action
that's yeah that's exactly right so in
particular we're conditioning our reward
on both the state and the action so that
doesn't really make sense to even be
able to talk about what our future value
is going to be if we don't really know
where we started so so the idea here is
that we start in some state s we take
action a and then we proceed every after
mm-hmm okay so that make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
