welcome it's gonna be our last office
hours and it's been a ton of fun teeing
this class at first like to thank the
students and professor Norvig you to
this has been a great experience great
when we got four questions this week all
right first question comes from Horace
he and he says what steps should I take
after finishing this class to keep
improving as a programmer that's a great
question there's so much to do of course
there are other classes available until
you can search online you can see what
classes are coming up next figure out
what you're interested in and and just
have at it and then the other thing is
to do more programming on your own to
pick out a project and try to achieve it
try to complete something and that can
either be find some open source project
where you can contribute or just
something of your own something that you
always wanted to do just get started and
try to build it and for small problems
project euler has a lot of really great
problems you can check that out online
hmmm next one comes from lima and so
after teaching this class you've seen a
lot of you've been very active in the
forums and you've seen a lot of the
common mistakes students it made so what
can you say but from the common mistakes
that have been made throughout this
class and any general suggestions on
being a good programmer huh I didn't see
that many things that were common across
everywhere let's see I guess a couple of
them some around the structure of
mutable variables seems to come up again
and again so you know I made this array
and then i altered the first element of
the array but all the elements got
altered why did that happen well that's
because each row of your matrix was
actually the same row so that seemed to
be a problem was one today of the
default arguments to functions they're
set up and that's a single argument so
if you modify it then you have a problem
with that so that was one thing I guess
another one is just reading the
documentation and getting familiar with
things and I don't see that so much as
an error on the part of the students I
just see it as
not having enough familiarity and it
just takes time to get familiar with
things and I guess another is just read
carefully and that I see people ask a
question and then see the answer and
then say ah so I realized the mistake I
made or the misconception I had and and
sometimes that's just part of the
learning process but maybe you could use
that as a lesson to yourself of saying
you know I'm stuck it must be because or
it could be because there's some
preconception that I have that is
blocking me and so think of you know
what preconceptions in my holding and
and should I relax one of those okay
next question comes from ginger Cullen
and she wants to know what areas of
software you are particularly excited
about I think it's an exciting time now
when there's so much going on and so
many opportunities new companies
springing up new ideas and software I
guess to me one of the things that's
really interesting is connecting with
the world in a deeper way that were
we're used to the idea of data like text
and numbers can be processed by
computers but now we're starting to see
images and video and sound and people
are walking around with phones that have
input devices for all of these
constantly with them and so this
connection to the real world is so much
stronger and that just opens up so many
new areas ok next question comes from
Eagles and ego this wants to know if you
have any tips for reading other people's
code and writing your own codes it's
more readable by others ok in terms of
reading other people's code a lot of it
is practice so just go out there and
start doing it I always like to play
with code when I'm reading it I find it
hard and frustrating to read code
without an interpreter or compiler
available so that i can actually run it
and try it and see what it does you know
theoretically you
should be able to write code so you
don't have to do that but it's just so
much easier if you can't to say you know
I'm a little I I really want an example
here of what does this function do and
the person wrote the code didn't
document it didn't give me an example ok
I can run up myself and see what it
produces so I think of reading as more
of an interactive process rather than a
passable in the rip the way you you read
a novel and don't be afraid to do that I
think another aspect is how are you
reading it you know and when you read a
novel you pretty much start at the front
you go to the end but when you read code
you don't do it like that and you have
to figure out what you're reading for
are you trying to understand the whole
code in which case you're still you're
still jumping around in here you're
figuring out what's the big idea what
are the key components let's flip back
and forth let's follow this cross
reference it's another reason why I
don't like reading statically I want to
be able to jump to the definition of a
sim oh and my IDE does that for me so
you're jumping around and then another
way of reading is to say ok here's a big
complicated package but i just wanted to
do this one thing and so i'm going to
restrict myself from trying to
understand everything i just want to
understand one path through so i can get
at this function call or this
functionality and have it do what i want
to do i find that hard for me and it's
so i guess one of the things i see is
sort of maybe a generation gap than that
the younger engineers i work with are so
much better at that than I am that they
can look at a piece of code and say I
just want to get this one functionality
they figure it out they use it they're
on to the next thing whereas I usually
lag behind I say okay you know i think i
got this functionality but gee this is
interesting let me look around a little
bit more see if i can understand the
structure more deeply so I'm learning
more from that but I'm diverting myself
from what my task really was to just
find out as much as I needed to know and
not more so that's something I know I
need to train myself on doing
better job of reading selectively all
right the last two questions both come
from geoff blum and his first question
what do you get your wonderful shirts
yeah okay Jeff well one answer is not
available to you in that my wife makes
some of them and and she's not going
into the business of mass producing them
so they you won't be able to get one
this one I think is made by a company
called jams world but you know I get
them wherever idea alright and the last
one a little more content driven is a
why do you structure so much this course
around games I'll make it a bit yeah I
guess the reason I chose games is I
wanted you to get experience of
understanding a set of rules and
following them and games are sort of
abstraction of that right we wanted to
have a seven-week class it's not that
long we want to be able to go through a
lot of examples and sort of more
real-world problems or purchase so
complicated and messy and I think that's
one reason games exist in the first
place right so they say like the game of
chess is supposed to be an abstraction
of war and that's much easier to set up
a chessboard than it is to muster up a
couple of armies and go through the
messy business of destroying each other
so games are an abstraction but they're
still complicated they have interactions
they have rules that you have to get
right and so they seemed just at the
right level for a short class like this
as opposed to a more real-world problem
where we have spent the whole seven
weeks just to understand one of them
great it's all the questions we had
there was way how about this one on
recursion oh sorry I missed that one
good yeah so yeah it was a question on
recursion I think this is also this was
from Eagles as well and basically he's
having a hard time implementing
recursion in his daily coding routine he
finds that it's easier to just use loops
and do use recursion in your everyday
cup so I guess there's a couple answers
to that
one is I think you should use it when
it's appropriate not when it's not now
there are some approaches and you know
they're even some simple languages where
recursion is your only way of
implementing loops I don't prefer that
approach I think you want to do what's
most natural and so when is recursion
natural I think there's a couple cases
one is when you have a recursive data
structure so if you have a tree a tree
is defined as it's either a note or it's
a node that has two trees or entries as
sub parts and so there's recursion built
right into the definition and it just
makes sense to to implement the whole
thing recursively and so most the time
when you have a structure like a tree
that's like that it's simpler to do a
recursive routine now sometimes you
don't so we showed some search
techniques where instead of just
searching recursively we built up a
queue like the frontier cue to
essentially hold the equivalent of what
would be on the recursive stack why do
we do that because we want a more
control over the order of the recursion
we didn't want to just do left branch
first or right branch first we want to
be able to pick where we went next and
so to to make control we made the
program more complicated so any time you
take a naturally recursive data
structure and process it non recursively
it becomes more complicated I think the
opposite is also true if you take a
non-recursive thing like iterating over
the elements of a list in a for loop for
x in list that's much simpler as a for
loop it becomes more complicated if you
write it recursively and so they are I
would prefer having four loops there's
another case that's sort of intermediate
where you have a mathematical formula
more often mathematical formulas are
written recursively and then you have to
decide is it best implement that with
with poor with a loop and so that's how
I see it the other question was are
there limitations in terms of the
implementation and yes that's true in
many languages there's a recursion limit
in some languages specific types of
calls in in a location in the function
whether the last thing that the function
does doesn't get counted against the the
call limit in Python they did get
counted so you have a limit my gift by
default in the C Python implementation
it's a thousand levels deep and so you
have to think about that you know so
even if it is more natural to do
recursion if you say well I'm going to
be doing it over structures that are
more than a thousand elements deep then
you have to accommodate and I guess
that's another reason to say why you
know recursing down a list is probably a
bad idea because you in many
applications you do have lists that are
more than a thousand elements deep but
recursing over a tree is probably okay
because if you have say a balanced
binary tree you can only hit the limit
if it has to to the thousandth elements
and it went out a memory before we you
hit that problem all right I think
that's all the questions and again it's
been a lot of fun any last words for the
students yeah thank you so much and good
luck on the on the rest of week six and
on the exam I think you'll find it
interesting and challenging and a good
conclusion to the class so thank you all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
