want to talk about the structure of an
actual HTML document really quick before
we move on now what we've been seeing
before is just little markup we've been
seeing things like this you know a
little text a few little simple tags but
an actual complete HTML document has
quite a bit more in it here is a whole
lot more HTML let's take this piece by
piece but this is what a complete HTML
document looks like first we have the
doctype and this is what kind of of HTML
assists this string right here is used
to be a lot more complex if you were to
Google for doc types you would see a lot
of different answers here but now that
we're using html5 it has a nice clean
simple doctype which is just the string
HTML very simple okay then we have a tag
this is the basically that the opening
HTML tag and the closing HTML tag this
surrounds the entire rest of the
document that's all it does is it
surrounds the entire document now we've
got this other tag here the head this
part of the document has kind of
metadata and another random stuff if you
were to include JavaScript and CSS CSS
remember we talked about is the styling
sort of stuff that would be included in
the head section you know we also have
this little tag here the title and this
is the title of the page this is what
would appear in the top of your browser
window or in the in your browser tab
this string right here then we have the
body tag and the body tag is actual
contents of the document and basically
we've been we've been working just in
the body tag in this lesson and for most
of this course we're really just going
to be focusing on generating the content
that fits between the body tags it's all
this other stuff is important and you'll
see it and will be you know we'll be
sending it over the wire but it doesn't
change very often and you know it's
pretty simple but it is important for it
to be there all of interesting stuff tho
happens between the body tax okay let's
take another view of HTML documents they
have a structure that can be visualized
like this in HTML document this whole
thing has a head section and that's
where we have our title references to
any CSS files any javascript files and
that sort of stuff and then we have the
body section
and this is where the actual contents of
the document the stuff that you see on
the screen this is where that comes from
and in this course are mostly going to
focus on this part of an HTML document
just the body section and there's a lot
of content that can go in there well you
know discuss briefly you know CSS and
JavaScript and how they fit into
everything but for the most part we're
going to be generating the contents the
body of an HTML document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
