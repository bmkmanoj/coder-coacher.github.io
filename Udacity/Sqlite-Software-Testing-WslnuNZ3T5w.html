about an example of testing done right
the example that I'm gonna use there's
an open-source database called SQLite
and you could read about it more at the
URL here and so in SQLite is this small
open source database that's designed to
be easily embeddable in other
applications it's really very widely
used but companies like Airbus Dropbox
it's used in various Apple products
Android phones run SQLite inside and
they're really a lot more examples and
by the way SQLite has good Python
bindings if you want to use it yourself
so this database is implemented in about
78 thousand lines of code so you can see
it's sort of a medium to small sized
project has software projects go
no on the other hand the test suite for
SQLite comes out to more than 91 million
lines of code so another way to think
about that is there's more than a
thousand times more tests than code so
if we have SQLite code over here gonna
be dwarfed by this gigantic mountain of
test code and so we might ask you as
well what's in this test code how is
SQLite tested what it turns out is the
author of SQLite has achieved 100%
branch coverage 100% mc/dc coverage the
author has done a large amount of random
testing and that'll be the subject of
units four five and six of this class
boundary value testing has been used the
code contains a ton of assertions it's
running to vow trend a tool I mentioned
earlier this is good for finding bugs in
programs written in C SQLite is
subjected to integer overflow checks and
a large amount of fault injection tests
are performed so what you can see here
is that almost everything I've told you
about in this course so far almost every
single testing technique and many of the
coverage metrics have been applied to
sequel Lite and the result is it's
generally a really solid piece of
software one reaction you might have
when you see a thousand times more tests
than code is it that's pretty extreme on
the other hand when you consider the
large number and wide variety of users
that SQLite has it's pretty great that
it's been tested so thoroughly of course
what I'm not doing here is advocating
that you go out and write a thousand
times more lines of tests than you have
code on the other hand it's nice to see
the certain people who have extremely
widely used codes actually do this kind
of thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
