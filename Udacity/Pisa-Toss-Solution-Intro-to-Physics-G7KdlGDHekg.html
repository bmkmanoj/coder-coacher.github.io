into two parts but i'm going to i prefer
to do it that way so let's see how long
it takes the ball to reach the top of
its trajectory one when you use this
equation and i know the top of the
trajectory the final velocity is zero
well the initial velocity is up at 20
meters per second and the acceleration
is negative remember if we've chosen v-0
to be positive and that's upwards
acceleration which is downwards must be
negative so that's the time of two
seconds to go upwards and once it's at
the top of its trajectory it's for that
instant not moving and it has to fall
all the way down to the ground but how
far doesn't have to fall well not just
the 57 meters from the top of the tower
to the ground also whatever distance
it's gained on its trip upwards let's
calculate that to make this extra
distance calculation I'm going to use
this equation and it turns out that it's
gone an extra distance of twenty meters
and notice that I've used a time of 2
because that's what we just calculated
with this extra distance of twenty
meters added to this 57 meters we have a
total fall distance of 77 meters and
this is the tool for the job there to
calculate how much time it's going to
take and the time to fall down is 3.9
seconds never send solving this equation
I've called the acceleration positive
again well that's because I called Delta
X positive I could have called Delta X
negative or sorry Delta Y negative since
it is moving downwards but when possible
I like to just work with positive
numbers so this is totally a matter of
preference so we have 3.9 seconds plus
our original 2 gives us a total of five
point nine seconds that the ball will
stay in the air good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
