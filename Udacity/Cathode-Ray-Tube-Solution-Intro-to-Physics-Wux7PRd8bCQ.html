solving this problem is to focus on
trying to solve for the time delta T
that the electron spends in this
electric field here so I'm going to use
this kinematics equation here and you
notice that I've just applied it to X
naught to Y we'll do the Y equation in a
second and the direction I'm calling X
is this direction here I'm going to call
this direction Y so the field is only
acting in the Y direction so I know
there's not going to be any X
acceleration so this term drops out and
this gives us that the time the electron
spends in the field is equal to the
length of the field divided by the speed
the electron enters the field with all
right so now I'm going to use this
kinematics equation to work in the Y
direction and we know that initially the
electron enters with only two velocity
in the X direction so this term goes to
zero and we know from our earlier
parallel plate problems that the
acceleration along the direction of the
field is going to be equal to the
strength of the field e times the charge
of on the electron divided by the
electrons mass and this gives us a nice
equation for our displacement in the Y
direction now we can substitute in in
our value of delta T into this equation
which gives us this equation here and
doing some algebra I can solve for the
electric field strength e in terms of
all these other variables now this looks
quite messy but I actually know all
these values I know that mass the
electron I know that's charge and I know
the X&amp;amp;Y distances and our initial speed
and plugging in all those values I get
that the electric field strength should
be 455 Newton's per Coulomb so that
means that if the electric field here is
455 Newton's per Coulomb we should get
this kind of bending and hit this part
