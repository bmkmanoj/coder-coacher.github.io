part of their security planning need to
have a security policy well Georgia Tech
has a computer and network use policy we
talking about do's and don'ts what is
okay to do and what you should not do so
let's quickly sort of look at some
things that are there in the Georgia
Tech computer and network use policy
well it does articulate let's talk about
what's on the guiding principles are why
does the policy look the way it does
well first of all we want that policy
guiding principle is that we want to
protect important IT resources that
Georgia Tech has so when you protect you
talking about protecting the data the
services and things like that which are
enabled by those resources other guiding
principle is that we don't let anything
illegal happen that involves our
computer systems our IT systems so you
should actually so these are the guiding
principles but you should read the
policy and here we're just going to talk
about sort of a couple of quick
highlights things that you might think
jump out and say why do we have this so
it talks about copyright and
intellectual property actually so why is
it talking about of course it's a
research university Georgia Tech creates
intellectual property and so on and you
know that intellectual property resides
on our computers but at the same time in
university campuses they used to be a
problem with people who download music
in particular they were download illegal
music and universities got into trouble
because of that so we obviously saying
that addressing that explicitly in the
policy remember the policies is about
dudes and don'ts and it is copyrighted
material or this intellectual property
how that should be handled of course it
talks about that interestingly it also
talks about export controls while
universities have people from all over
the world and people work with
counterparts in other countries and
things like that when it's exchange of
things across national boundaries of
course export control becomes an issue
and that's why it's interesting that
sort of it makes its way into into this
policy but again this is sort of the
guiding principle here
is that there are any legal requirements
we are okay with them Georgia Tech's
policy actually also remember one of the
things we said you know we have to make
sure that they're people who responsible
for it and can be held accountable and
things like that so it does address
responsibility for securing the
resources or the assets that we have and
it's sort of a distributed
responsibility at Georgia Tech and you
look at sort of the larger Network
office of information technology which
is a central organization for the entire
university well they're responsible for
it but if you look at individual devices
laptops or servers or less tops well
that is the responsibility of the unit
or the individual whose machine it is
unit for example school of computer
science or the college's computing for
example would be responsible for the
computers that are used by their staff
faculty and students but network-wide
protecting the Georgia Tech network that
is the responsibility of the central
office as I said you should read the
policy in all the different aspects that
are covered by it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
