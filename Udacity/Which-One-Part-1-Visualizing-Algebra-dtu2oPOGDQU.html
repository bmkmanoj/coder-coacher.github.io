the terms the denominator since
additions commutative so we'll have X
plus 7 divided by the quantity X plus 7
these expressions are identical so we're
really left with positive one for the
second rational expression we know it
equals negative 1 this B squared is
positive and this B squared is negative
whereas this 5 is negative and this 5 is
positive so we definitely have opposite
polynomials we see that here if we just
reverse the terms in the denominator and
keep the signs in front of them we
factor a negative one from the
denominator and then the b squared minus
5 s can cancel this leaves us with
negative 1 for this third one you might
have thought it was negative 1 you might
have cancelled the terms which are a and
then simplified negative 5 over positive
5 but remember we can't cancel terms we
can only cancel factors a is positive in
the numerator and positive in the
denominator so these aren't opposite
polynomials the 5s have different signs
which mean this polynomial can equal
positive 1 it must be something else and
for the last one we could switch the
terms in the denominator and then factor
a negative one from the numerator the
common factors of 2x minus 9 simplify to
1 leaving us with negative 1 as our
result great work if you even got two of
those correct these were pretty tough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
