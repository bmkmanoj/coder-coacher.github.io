x-intercepts at 20 and negative 20 and
these two points are the y-intercepts
there at 0 comma 3 and 0 comma negative
3 now we can connect these points with a
smooth curve and then we'll have our
ellipse so for our circle we had equal
amounts of x squared + y squared and our
radius was six so we started from the
center and we move six units left and
right and up and down to graph that
circle now for our ellipse we're going
to move two units left and right in the
x-direction and three units up and down
in the y-direction these two points are
the x intercepts and these two points
are y intercepts now there's an easier
way to graph this ellipse than finding
the x intercepts and y intercepts
remember that this equation is the same
as this equation so let's graph this one
instead I'm going to get rid of this
equation first and now i'm going to
write this equivalent equation in its
place we'll have x squared divided by 4
plus y squared divided by 9 equals 1 and
remember that we're basing this equation
on the Pythagorean theorem so we can
really think of 4 as 2 squared and we
can really think of 9 as 3 squared we
could have graphed this ellipse by
looking at these two numbers the squared
number underneath the x squared term
tells us to move two units left and
right from the center so since this is a
2 squared we move two units to the right
from the center and two units from the
left from the center the squared number
under the y squared term tells us to
move 3 units up and three units down
from the center this gives us our same
four points and we're able to graph our
lips in general this is the equation
will use for an ellipse centered at the
origin notice that there's no number
added or subtracted to the X or to the Y
so the center will be at 0 0 now what
I've gone ahead and done is added this
equation into desmos and I've created
sliders or adjustments for the values of
a and the values of B notice that if a
and B are both 1 we get a circle
centered at the your
this is the idea that will have equal
amounts of x squared + y squared and the
radius would just be one now if i
increase a we stretch in the x-direction
one unit to the left and one unit to the
right this gives me an ellipse since i
have more x squared than i do y squared
and we could keep stretching our lips we
could have an a value of three and a
value of four or an a value of five
since the a value is underneath the x
squared term that's the direction it
stretches in in order to stretch the
ellipse vertically up and down we want
to adjust the B value we can make the B
value be two or three or even four and
notice that if we bring it all the way
up to five again we'll have a perfect
circle since we have even amounts of x
squared + y squared this is why it's
helpful to identify the a value and the
B value to graph an ellipse the a value
tells us how far we should move from the
center left and right and the B value
tells us how far we should move to the
center up and down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
