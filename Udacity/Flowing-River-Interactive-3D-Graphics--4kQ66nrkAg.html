elements here are figuring out how to
get the elapsed time and how to offset
the texture itself about the only tricky
bit is the realization that if you want
the texture to move downwards you add
the time to the offset this has the
effect of moving the textures frame of
reference up which in turn moves the
display of the texture down my solution
is actually offsetting the V value a
potentially huge amount as the time
increases but it doesn't matter since
the texture repeats a less efficient
solution is this it's best to avoid
creating new objects every frame such as
this vector eventually JavaScript has to
perform garbage collection which can
cause your animations to hesitate at
intervals once I had the basic solution
I started to play with the horizontal
offset to giving this offset a slight
wobble with a sine wave made it a little
more appealing I also changed the
repetition length along the vertical
axis by dividing the repeat factor by
three this gives a more stream like a
peer instilling river or waterfall now
look in the additional course materials
for my snippet of code and try it out
yourself then try other functions it's
pretty addictive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
