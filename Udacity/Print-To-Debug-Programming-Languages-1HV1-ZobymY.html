Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to make
the output easier to read I'll just
comment out this debugging and now we
can see that oh this wasn't quite the
right answer we didn't actually fix the
problem we should have both of them
Lucretia alone Elizabeth alone and none
of them we have both of them we have
elizabeth alone and we have none of them
but we don't have Lucretia alone this
wasn't quite the right answer what do we
do now we put back in our print
statement debugging and take a look and
see what happens we really want one of
these to be either Lucretia alone or
Elizabeth alone hmm but this is a lot of
debugging output and it's hard to read I
don't like it this is much too annoying
so now this is a time when you want to
narrow things down and have more
localized debugging we already know that
the problem is with one of these two
expressions and currently we're not
getting Lucretia and Elizabeth in sort
of the right orders I'll add some new
print debugging here indicating what the
current element I'm selecting is so I'm
changing the debugging information so
that it's more localized to what I
actually care about and now surprisingly
this actually gives us a better feel for
the problem when we come in at the
beginning Lucretia's our current element
so we expect our two recursive calls to
have her and not have her well our first
recursive call is this part and our
second recursive call is this part in
the second recursive call where we don't
select her things are looking ok but in
the first recursive call where we do
select her somehow we're remembering her
the first time but not the second time
let me add just a little bit more
debugging information to keep track of
what's been selected so far and now we
can really see exactly what's going on
our current element is Lucretia so in
some recursive calls she should be one
of the things we've selected so far but
we're not seeing that some of the time
and that points us exactly to this line
in the code where we're not copying down
what has been selected so far so I try
making this change comment out my print
statement debugging and rerun oh
now we're getting the four elements we
expect now let's try adding in susan b
anthony and we do get the a dancers we
wanted so we fixed the bug but it
involved print statement debugging at a
high level and then at a more
concentrated level to get a better feel
for what was going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
