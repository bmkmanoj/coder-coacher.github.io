lenses the symmetrix of the focal length
will be on both sides of the lens let's
imagine that I have a 3d object on this
part of the scene here and the image
plane is being formed on this side so I
put an object here basically remembering
what we looked at in last slide any
parallel light goes through goes to the
focal point here continues on anything
that goes through the optical point here
goes to unadulterated and then the third
line of course the opposite or the
converse of this one anything that goes
to the focal point will become parallel
on the other side so in essence these
three lines will converge at this point
and this is where the image will be
formed so this is where the image point
is for this object so raised from points
on a plane parallel to the lens focus on
a point that is far away here and we
would actually now come up with an
equation that basically connects the
object distance from the lens to the
focal length to where the image is
formed so here of course I would be my
tree again as we've noticed on the other
side it will be formed upside down and
again just calling this distance of the
object from the lens itself to be 0 and
the distance to the image as I so this
is what is referred to as a lens
equation and mathematically basically
it's 1 over the distance of the object
from the lens plus 1 over distance of
the image from the lens is equal to 1
over the focal length</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
