to help work things out yeah actually it
makes it a lot easier I was I was
thinking about how I would do this and
we're involved writing a whole lot of
equations and doing a whole lot of stuff
but actually just by writing out the
Bayes net we ended up filling out these
tables we ended up doing that so the
bottom table is basically tells me the
probability of ball two being some color
in a world where ball one is known to be
green because we just wrote down that
part of the table so we'd have to do it
for every other one and you know if I
knew that I were in box one then the
probability of it being blue in a world
where ball one was green is in fact zero
and if I knew I were in box two then the
probability of being blue in where ball
one is green and we're in box two is
three quarters so I only care about that
last column all right and now I just
have to choose the row or choose how to
distribute the likelihood over the row
so all I really need to know is what's
the probability of me being in box one
of being in box two all right which we
have in the table as well as a half
right so that means the probability of
it being ball to the ball to being blue
in a world where ball one is green is
just the probability of ball two being
blue a given that ball one is green and
we want to know the probability two is
blue given that one is green but when
you look at the table and all we care
about is that last column all we really
want to know is well we know the answer
when box one when we're in box 1 when
box equals one it's zero and we know the
answer when box equals two it's 3/4 so
if we were going to do a sample for
example but what you talked about
earlier we would just sample a bunch of
times and we would get 0 sometimes we
would get 3/4 sometimes and that would
be great except of course we want to
compute this exactly and we know how to
compute it exactly because we actually
know the distribution over how many
times box would be equal to one and how
many times a box would be equal to two
it would be a half in each case so I
really like I think you've made this
easier by giving us the table so we're
actually writing out the Bayes net so we
want to know the probability that the
second ball is
given that the first ball was green and
that's just equal to the probability
that the second ball was blue given that
the first ball is green and we were in
box one because if we knew that we knew
we were in box one and the first ball we
grew was green and be really easy to
compute the probability the second
bobbing blue it's right there in the
table at zero is this is this the way
that you think it should be written
almost but not quite that would be the
easy thing to do because we know the
answer we know the probability that a
box is equal to one it's just a half but
it's not just the probability that box
is equal to one it's the probability
that box is equal to one in a world
where we knew the first thing we drew
was green gotcha
and if we had that then it would be easy
to figure out the the products there to
figure out two is blue in a world where
the Box one is green box box is equal to
1 and the first ball that we pulled was
equal to it was green and then we would
just add that to the probability that
the second ball we drew was blue given
that the first ball that we drew was
green and we were in box two or we were
drawing from box two and that would have
to be weighted by the probability that
box was two in a world where the first
ball that we grew drew was green good
very good
and in fact this rule that you kind of
work through follows just algebraically
from two of the rules that we just
talked about it's the combination of the
marginalization rule which lets us
introduce this box variable but the way
that we wrote it before it was you have
to and it in but then we actually then
applied the chain rule to split that
into a conditional probability so so
this is all valid at the moment and
there are these quantities that we that
we know well we certainly know the very
first term in each of the two some ands
and these some means let's say let's say
there's some ands and if they're not
we'll get nasty emails from people the
first parts probability second balls
blue given that the first one is a green
we're in box 1 and the probability the
second ball is blue given that the first
one is green and we're in box 2 so
that's easy that's actually on the table
that's easy that's it
Abell and it's zero in this case and
three-quarters in this case right so
it's zero in the first case and it's
three-quarters in the second case
straight out of the table and now all we
have to do is figure out how often we're
in box one and how I have tiller in box
two and if you didn't think it through
you would just have the probability of
box equals 1 then the probability box
equals 2 but we have to remember we're
in a world where the first ball we
picked was green so now we just have to
compute each of those terms so how do we
do that so we want to know what the
probability is that box is where in box
1 given that we picked a green ball
first well that one's actually much
easier to think about because Bayes rule
give us allow us to express this in
quantities where we do know the answer
because we have the tables so that would
be the probability that the first ball
was green given that we were in box 1
times the probability that we're in box
1 divided by the probability that the
first thing we picked is green so the
probability that we get a green ball if
we pick box 1 is just well it's 3/4 yep
different 3/4 than the other one though
yeah those those two 3/4 aren't the same
3/4 this is this way because sometimes 2
3 quarters are not the same 2 3 quarters
in this case there are 3 green balls and
1 what we're pretending to call yellow
because it's easier to write than orange
ball and so three of the four of them
are green so if we were in box when we
close our eyes we get three of those
so what's the probability that we're in
box one well it's right there in the
table the Bayes net it's 1/2 so now we
just have to figure out well what's the
probability that I would get a green
wall the first time I picked one right
and so one easy way to do that is we
actually do this this whole process
again on box two and then just normalize
or we could break this apart using using
the marginalization rule yeah which one
do you want to do the first one I think
okay so figuring out the probability the
first one is green isn't as easy as it
looks you can't just say well there are
five green balls but there's a total of
nine balls and so it's five ninths
because those nine balls aren't
distributed equally
both sides of the boxes so you really
have to you still have to know which box
that you're in in some sense great but
we can kind of skip that step okay so I
like this so what's the probability that
the first ball is Green given that we're
in box - well it's just two-fifths proof
by looking at the screen and what's the
prior probability that were in box two
was just half because that was given to
us on the table and so we still don't
know the prior probability of the first
ball being green but it turns out we
don't have to because there are only two
boxes and so we can just normalize and
the right thing will happen so 3/4 times
1/2 is equal to 3/8 and 2/5 times 1/2 is
equal to 2/10 or 1/5 and that's right so
3/8 is also 15 over 40 and 1/5 is 8 over
40 why do we do that because we want to
be able to add them up and normalize and
so that means if you added those two
together and put them in the Dominator
that would give you 23 over 40 and so
how much is 15:40 is of 23 over 40th
well it's 15 out of 23 and so without
ever directly computing the probability
that one equals green we know that the
probability of us being in box 1 given
that the first ball pool was green is 15
over 23 which was a lot of work to do
considering that we knew we were going
to multiply it by zero none of this work
mattered but we did it because we love
probability no it was it was kind of
helpful because we needed to know how to
normalize these two numbers right so it
was useful but I mean just the whole
thing we already kind of knew that that
was zero but this one we didn't know all
right this one we didn't know and so now
we know that the the other case is a
23rd and we're done so zero times 15
divided by 23 is 0 and 3/4 times 8 23rd
is 24 over 92 right and we can there's a
factor of 4 in both of those so it's
actually 6 23rd that's what I said
whoo Wow boy it would be nice if we had
an algorithm to do this for us man and
the algorithm should not involve me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
