the first question we want to answer is
what is a database there's a number of
ways of answering this question but
probably the simplest definition is a
program that stores and retrieves data
particularly large amounts of data or
even more particular large amounts of
structured data and we'll talk about
what that means in a sec so let's go to
the let's go to the picture we've been
working on quite a bit in this class
we've got our user and his computer and
the internet and our service now up
until now we've been referring to these
servers as basically these are web
servers running our web applications but
in many cases these servers are actually
database servers as well and so we might
have a special server just for databases
so database can refer to you know a
program that's storing and retrieving
the data or it can refer to the machine
running this program or it can refer to
a system of machines running this
program operating together and just like
just like a web server may refer to you
know just the program with a web server
or the physical machine or the group of
machines all working together to host
your web application so a request may
come in from from a user via the
Internet through our servers and then we
may need to retrieve some data for that
user
you know let's say let's say this is
reddit and we need to you know draw the
front page so we need to get a list of
links that were going to draw and we get
that from the database and then database
responds with the data to the the web
application which may you know
manipulate the data and somehow get it
ready for display and then send it back
to the user but anytime you're storing
large amounts of data you're probably
going to be using a database and that is
what we're gonna spend most of our time
