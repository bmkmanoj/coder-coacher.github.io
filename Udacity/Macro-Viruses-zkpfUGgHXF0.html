first what is a macro a macro is
actually a program embedded in a
document such as a Microsoft Word
document he typically contains
instructions for some useful functions
such as opening a file or starting a new
application and because a macro is an
excludable program it can be infected by
viruses just like any other excusable
programs what's unique about macro
viruses is that users typically don't
suspect that a document will contain a
virus here's how a macro virus can
typically spread first the attacker
create a macro that contains a virus and
attach it to a Word document
and then this document can be sent
around for example through email
attachment and then when an unsuspecting
user clicks on the email touch man and
opens the document the document is
opened on the user's computer when the
document is opened the mackerel executes
and as a result the macro virus also
runs the virus then copies itself to the
global macro file when the document
opens the macro executes and the macro
virus also runs when the macro virus
runs he can perform a number of
malicious activities such as sending the
same Word document to a number of users
in a user's address book as an
attachment and thus spreading itself
what's more interesting is that the
macro virus can copy itself to the
global macro file as a result whenever
the user opens a new document or creates
a new document
the global macro will be copied into a
document and that's another way that the
micro virus can spread</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
