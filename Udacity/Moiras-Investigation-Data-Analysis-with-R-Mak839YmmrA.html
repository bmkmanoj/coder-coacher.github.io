the next lessons you'll get to hear from
more more has done some exciting work at
Facebook and she'll be sharing one of
her projects with you let's hear from
her so one of the things that I've been
looking at lately is whether people's
perception of their audience on Facebook
matches up to the reality who's actually
seeing the content that they're sharing
because who you think is in your
audience really affects how you present
yourself so to investigate this problem
I worked with Michael Bernstein
Brian Carr and eight on bakshi and
together we ran a survey where we
pointed people to a post that they'd
made in the last couple of weeks and we
said how many people do you think saw
this post and then we took their
responses to that question and we
actually counted how many people had
viewed that post for about a second at
least and we found that there was a
pretty big mismatch between people's
perceived audience size and their actual
audience size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
