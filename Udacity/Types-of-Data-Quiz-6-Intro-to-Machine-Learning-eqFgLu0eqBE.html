tricky you might have said other but I
would actually argue that this is a type
of text it's not words maybe in the most
classic sense but it's words of a very
specialized vocabulary where the
vocabulary is email addresses and so
text wrangling tools might be one of the
better ways to deal with email addresses
great job now that we've gone through
all of these examples of types of data
hopefully you have a good sense for what
might be some interesting features to
look for and what type of data those
features are now obviously not
everything we talked about here is
something that's going to be available
to us in the email corpus for example
salary information is very very
interesting but it's not going to show
up in your email inbox so now let me
tell you a little bit more about the
data set that we've made because I
haven't been totally honest so far we do
have a lot of emails but there's some
other very interesting stuff that we
have available as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
