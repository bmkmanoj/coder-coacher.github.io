number of people with big heads and
happy smiles and after every heck
semester each one of our happy you
dacians goes out and asks spread number
of their friends to also take the course
and this process continues as long as
the number of you dacians is less than
the target with a little bit of math you
can solve this pretty straightforward
and you might have done it in middle
school or high school but we're going to
use recursion to solve this problem very
easily and remember what we're looking
for is the number of heck semesters this
process goes through until we reach the
target I saw on the forums a couple
people we're trying to use global
variables that counted recursive calls
but really that kind of defeats the
purpose in the power that we can use in
the recursion and I'm going to show you
how to do that and right now so our base
case says that if we've met our target
then we don't need any time to spread in
order to reach the target because we're
already there now here I have a plus one
because we're going to say that we're
doing one iteration of the mutation
spreading process now for the recursive
call the first thing we need is n well n
is going to be the same thing as last
time plus how many new people we've
gotten which is spread times n a more
succinct way of writing this would be
simply an x 1 plus the spread the
spreading rate doesn't change so we're
going to leave that alone and our target
doesn't change and that's it we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
