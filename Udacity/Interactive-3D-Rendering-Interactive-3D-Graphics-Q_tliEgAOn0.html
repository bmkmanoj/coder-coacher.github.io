rendering in particular let's break that
phrase down starting from the end this
last word rendering means depiction well
it can also mean translating to another
language or turning animals into meat
but let's ignore those definitions an
artist can render a scene by painting it
an architect can render a building in
perspective and so on to render means to
create an image for the phrase 3d this
means defining things in a
three-dimensional world in the field of
3d computer graphics you mathematically
define objects materials lights and a
camera and then use these together to
render onto a two-dimensional screen
your monitor becomes a window into this
world that you've created even newer
smartphones have 3d graphics
accelerators in them yuvan doubtedly
seen video games and special effects in
movies these are two of the most obvious
uses of 3d computer rendering techniques
there are a vast number of other uses of
3d rendering that affects how the world
works
Architects commonly create 3d graphics
presentations for their own benefit and
for clients Engineers use rendering to
help show potential problems with their
designs doctors use 3d reconstructions
from medical scanning devices to
understand patient's problems even
lawyers will employ 3d animations to
help explain accidents or other events
interactive means you can instantly
influence what you see on the screen
video games give us obvious examples you
turn the wheel left in a racing game and
go that direction
compare this to say playing a DVD
there's perhaps some minimal control
that could be considered interactive
pause fast-forward and so on but you're
not affecting the world itself in any
way drawing these lines is interactive
I'm affecting what I see but it's
two-dimensional by interactive 3d I mean
that the users actions affect something
in a 3d virtual world at the least you
move the camera through the world
possibly affecting objects and lighting
as you go this program by James Gauchos
MRI data of how the brain is stimulated
when exposed to different objects and
actions on the right is a 2d system for
picking an object on the left you then
see the area stimulated you can also
change the view and with the slider
control how the data is represented I
asked Jack gallant who helped with this
program about how much of the brain is
dedicated to processing what our eyes
see the answer is that more than a
quarter of our brain is involved in
interpreting
visual signals I should note that there
are other areas of computer graphics
having to do with images but that are
not truly 3d rendering for example
there's a complementary field called
image processing where you use the
computer to analyze photographs or other
images and try to extract a mathematical
description of the world from them
though graphics hardware can definitely
accelerate image processing operations
will mostly be focused on 3d rendering
