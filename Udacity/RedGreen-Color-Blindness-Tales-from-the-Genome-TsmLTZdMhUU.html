that the trade is sex linked with
regards to its inheritance pattern and
it appears to be recessive now how do we
know this well as far as inheritance
pattern is concerned it looks sex linked
because only males are affected that's a
hallmark sign that we have a gene
traveling on an X chromosome somewhere
it can be maternal inheritance because
maternal inheritance means that it's
passed down through the mitochondria and
so if a mother was affected all of her
children would be affected and in this
case we have an affected son who doesn't
have an affected mother so that can't be
right now while it's still plausible
that it might be autosomal the big
skewing here of only males being
affected is our big hint that it's most
likely sex linked in reality we really
need a pedigree that's bigger than this
we need more information but for our
intents and purposes here this is the
sort of size of pedigree we're looking
at and this is a good enough indication
that it's more likely sex linked than
autosomal the trade also appears to be
recessive not dominant because it
doesn't show up in every generation
which is a hallmark of recessive traits
and we have unaffected parents giving
rise to affected offspring in dominant
traits we see the opposite where
effective parents have affected
offspring and it doesn't skip generation
so we know dominance most likely not the
right answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
