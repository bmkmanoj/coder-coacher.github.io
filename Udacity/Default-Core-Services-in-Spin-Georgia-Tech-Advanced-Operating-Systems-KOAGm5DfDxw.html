spin for building an operating system
now one can build each of the services
we talked about early on that an
operating system should provide such as
memory management CPU scheduling threads
file system network protocol stack and
so on from scratch as extensions to spin
as we know memory management and CPU
scheduling are core services that any
operating system should provide however
an extensible operating system should
not dictate how these services should be
implemented spin provides interface
procedures for implementing these
services in the operating system
physical memory is a precious resource
we know that native operating systems
such as Linux or Windows manages the
physical memory that is available from
the hardware spin wants to allow
extensions to manage physical memory
allocated to them in whatever fashion
they choose to the macro allocation of a
bunch of physical memory to an extension
it's outside the scope of this
discussion but assume that the
allocation of a bunch of physical memory
happens when an extension starts up the
discussion in this tablet frame is to do
with the management of the pre-allocated
physical memory by the extension the
interface functions that I am showing
you here for memory management are
simply header files provided by spin for
example allocating a page frame d
allocating a page frame reclaiming a
page frame similarly allocating a
virtual page or d allocating a virtual
page which might be used for dynamic
memory allocation translating has to do
with creating and destroying address
spaces adding or removing mapping
between virtual pages and physical
frames all of those are interface
functions that are provided as header
files
by spin and memory management because of
what we said earlier about
over-commitment of memory not all of a
processes address space is going to be
fitting in physical memory so there are
event handlers that are provided as part
of the core service of spin for handling
page fault access fault meaning if you
have a page that is right protected and
if a process tries to write to it that's
an access violation or if a process is
trying to access a region of memory that
it doesn't have access to generating a
bad address exception all of these are
interface functions that are defined as
core services of memory management in
the spin operating system it is not
saying anything about how these services
are implemented but it is giving you
just a header file the implementer of an
extension has to write the actual code
for these head of functions and create a
logical protection domain that
corresponds to physical address
management virtual address management
translation management and the handler
functions for dealing with these
different types of events once the
logical protection domain is dynamically
instantiated it becomes an extension of
spin and after that there is no border
crossing between a particular service
that has been so instantiated and spent
itself and all of these functions are
invoked automatically when the Hardware
events occur corresponding to a page
fault or access violation fault and so
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
