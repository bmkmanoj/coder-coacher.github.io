similarly every VM has an i/o ring which
is dedicated for disk i/o this is an i/o
ring associated with VM one this is an
i/o ring associated with VM two similar
to network virtualization here also the
communication between the guest
operating system and then strives to
avoid copying altogether no copying in
the Zen because what we're doing is we
are including descriptors for the disk
i/o that we want to get done with
pointers to the guest operating system
buffers where the data is already
contained if the transfer has to go into
the disk or a placeholder for the data
to come in to from the disk and the
philosophy being a synchronous i/o and
queuing these descriptors into this i/o
ring by the guest operating system
happens asynchronously with respect to
Xen and queuing responses back for prior
requests coming from this VM since then
is in charge of the actual devices in
particular in this case the disk
subsystem it may reorder requests from
competing domains in order to make the
i/o throughput efficient but there may
be situations where such requests view
ordering may be inappropriate from the
semantics of the i/o operation and
therefore then also provides a reorder
barrier for guest operating systems to
enforce that do this operations in
exactly the order in which I have given
them such a reorder barrier for instance
may be necessary for higher level
semantics such as right ahead logging
and things like that so that completes
discussion of all the subsystems that
need to be virtualized whether it is by
a fully virtualized environment or a
para virtualized environment next we
will talk about usage and billing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
