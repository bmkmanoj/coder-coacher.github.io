diffie-hellman that i want to talk about
is this problem of finding a large prime
the protocol assumes that we can start
with this value Q which is the large
prime number it doesn't have to be kept
secret but it should be different and
the reason we want it to be different is
if there was only one large prime number
and everyone used the same one then an
attacker could do a lot of pre
computation based on that number and
have a better chance of breaking a
diffie-hellman protocol so both
protocols require a way to generate
large prime numbers for different
Hellman you might think well maybe we
could have some large computing resource
to do that not every participant needs
to do this themselves for RSA which
we'll talk about the next unit every
participant needs to generate their own
prime numbers to be able to generate
their own key so we'll talk now about
how to do that so both of these crypto
systems depend on finding large prime
numbers so the first question we should
ask is are there enough prime numbers
that we can always find a new one when
we need one the good news is that Yuko
approved over 2,500 years ago that there
are infinitely many Prime's and it's a
very elegant and beautiful proof so
let's look at how you could prove this
well start by assuming there are a
limited number of primes that would mean
we could define a set consisting of all
of the prime numbers and know that it's
a finite set with n Prime's in it so the
elements would be 2 3 5 and so forth and
there would be some highest prime which
we don't know the value of so then we'll
compute the product of all those Prime's
and add one so let's have a quiz is the
value that we computed is P a prime
number so the possible answers are no
it's definitely not prime
maybe we don't know enough to determine
that or yes is definitely prime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
