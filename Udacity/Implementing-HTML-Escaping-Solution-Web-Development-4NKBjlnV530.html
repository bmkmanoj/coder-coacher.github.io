each of the characters we need to
replace and for staying greater-than
less-than quote i replace it with it's
appropriate escaped version of the
string you know I'm just overwriting the
same the same string over and over again
just maybe not the finest way to do it
but uh you know it'll work in our case
and keep in mind that you need to
replace the ampersand first although you
know if you did a last for example when
I enumerated it last to be a jerk you
you you would replace you know greater
than with ampersand greater than and
then you'd replace the ampersand in your
new escape string with and you know in
ampersand and so let's test this a few
times make sure it's working okay
obviously it prints this test string
test let's give this one a test okay and
this is what we get we see our less fan
is escaped to ampersand LT and our grade
event has escaped and so is our next
less than an hour next greater then
let's let's test the other ones to make
sure everything's working I'm going to
change I'm gonna get rid of these quotes
and use single quotes instead so we can
test the escaping of those and let's
what's the other one we didn't test aha
yes we'll do our quiz from before amp
equals amp and we'll see how this prints
okay so here we go run we see our double
quote was replaced with you know a twat
and then our am forced and this was the
quiz question we asked it before so we
have ampersand ant which turns into one
and percent here equals ampersand amp
that ampersand and resists amp for the
letters amp and then our closing quote
okay so let me show you one other
simpler way of writing this function we
can replace most of this code like so we
can say imports CGI as it turns out this
function is already included in Python
escape quote equals true otherwise it
doesn't escape the quote and oops let's
return this okay so another way of
writing this function is just to use the
CGI module that is included with Python
and let's give this a shot and you can
see it works just the same
ampersand quad hello and Pristina blah
blah blah blah
we see our scape version of our string
here and this is obviously a lot simpler
than writing at your own you know you
may need more functionality in yours if
you want to do that in the future but
for now the built-in one will work just
fine okay good job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
