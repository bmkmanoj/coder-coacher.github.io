there's one more thing that bothered me
in the initial specification and that
was we said that if there's a tie don't
worry about it or we claim that there
won't be any ties but you know there
could be and I would hate to have this
program told me I lost when I actually
tied I wouldn't mind it telling me I won
when I actually tied but I don't want it
to tell me that I lost what if I finally
got a straight flush
ace high only to find that another
player had exactly the same hand but in
a different suit well if that happened
in the Old West you might expect some
shots to be fired but assuming there was
no cheating going on the two winners
should split the pot equally that's the
way the rules of Poker work and the way
our program would work is it would
arbitrarily choose one of the maximums
out of the two that tied that doesn't
seem fair so to accommodate that idea
what do you think we can do so how are
we going to handle ties we could change
the function and rank we could change
the function poker or we could add a new
function and check which ones you think
would work okay and which ones which
single one do you think would be best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
