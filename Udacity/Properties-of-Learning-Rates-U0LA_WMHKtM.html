fact there's a very general property
that could be stated about learning
algorithms of this type so if we have a
learning update rule like the one that
we have which is that the value at time
T is the value of t time t minus 1 plus
some learning rate times the difference
between the new estimate and the
previous estimate or the new observed
value and the previous estimate then
this this VT will actually go to the
true expectations the actual average
value of the ARS
once T is big enough ok so that's good
that means it's actually learning the
right thing but there are conditions
that we have to put on the learning rate
sequence then the learning rate sequence
has to have the property that if you sum
up all the learning rates it actually
sums up to infinity it's you know it's
unbounded it diverges as opposed to
greater than infinity oh good point
yes that it's equal to infinity very
good it's actually greater than any
finite number anyway yeah so it diverges
but the square of the learning rates if
you sum those up it's less than infinity
and and we're I'm going to get into the
details about why this these are the
standard properties for for making this
kind of learning rule work but to a
first approximation the learning rates
have to be big enough so that you can
move to what the true value is no matter
where you start but they can't be so big
that they don't damp out the noise the
and actually do the proper proper job of
averaging so if you just accept that
these are the two conditions that make
sure that that's true that gives us a
way of choosing different kinds of
learning rate sequences ok so what's
some alphas that satisfy that and some
alphas that don't alpha sub T's that
satisfy that and some of the dome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
