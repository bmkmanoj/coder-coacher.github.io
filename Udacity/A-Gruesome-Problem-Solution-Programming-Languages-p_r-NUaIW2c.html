the title is a bit menacing all we're
really going to do is color words sounds
like fun so we're going to use two
colors to start out with blue and green
now we say a word is blue if a lowercase
B occurs before a lowercase T within the
word we say a word is green if a
lowercase G occurs after the occurrence
of the lowercase T within the word so an
example of a blue word would be wombat
because we have a lowercase B occurring
before a lowercase T as an example of a
green word we have racketeering because
G occurs after the occurrence of a
lowercase T as one last example we have
the word abating which is blue because b
occurs before tea and green because G
occurs after tea so yes one word can be
both blue and green and lastly we just
find a new color I will call it grew it
may look like some purplish pink but
it's a brand new color that you've never
seen before because I say so a word is
grew if it's blue or green and it can be
both blue and green and still be grew so
all three of the words I used here or
grow so those are gruesome words and
we've been asked to identify all the GRU
words within a given string and we're
going to use our regular expression
skills to do that so what is a regular
expression going to look like my basic
strategy is going to write it like this
where I'm going to define what a blue
word is like and the green word is like
and match both words using the regular
expression or operator so first let's
look at blue here i have the regex for
blue words we have 0 more characters
followed by a lowercase B and in between
the B and the tea can be 0 more
characters and after the bmt we can have
0 more characters when you do the same
thing with green you are have a T and G
with zero more characters before after
an in-between so here I have a solution
to the problem I import the regular
expression library and then I just use
our you'd find all with the completed
regular expression first we identify
blue words and then afterwards we do the
green words and
we just feed in the string that we pass
into the function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
