going to introduce a new tool for us to
work with springs springs are a whole
lot of fun and we can use them to make
all sorts of fun things like trampolines
and spring scales we could even use them
to protect people if elevator cables
snap and springs add all sorts of fun
problems to physics so we're going to do
a few of those now but first I just want
to introduce a few of the concepts we're
going to need to understand how Springs
behave to make sure we're all on the
same page for our discussion of Springs
I want to go over some of the
assumptions we make when we're talking
about Springs we're going to assume that
we can either compress Springs like this
or stretch them like this what we're not
going to deal with is Springs being
pulled at an angle like this now whether
you can actually handle problems like
this in physics but that's a bit beyond
the scope of this class so we're going
to assume that the spring only moves in
one dimension it can either be squished
or it can be pulled on to extend it
we're also going to assume that the mass
of our Springs is zero so they're
massless Springs now that doesn't seem
very realistic but it's a really helpful
assumption for solving our problems and
it turns out that in many cases the mass
of the spring is pretty small compared
to the masses of the other things we're
dealing with in the problem so this
assumption isn't a terrible one but just
know that if you were doing super
realistic problems we couldn't say that
Springs are massless one important
concept will need in our discussion of
Springs is this idea of equilibrium
length and to see what this is let's
look at a few examples so first imagine
that we have a spring here that no
forces are acting on nobody's pulling it
or pushing it or anything like that even
though it's not being pushed or pulled
it has some natural length that it likes
to be at it might be maybe a tenth of a
meter or something like that we call
this natural length of the spring the
equilibrium length now if we pull on the
spring or push on the spring to compress
it or extend it then we're going to
change the length of the spring away
from the equilibrium length and the
amount that the length of the string
changes we call Delta X so Delta X is
the change in the length of the spring
away from the equilibrium length it's
important to note that both extending
the spring and compressing the spring
can change the length of the spring away
from the equilibrium length all right
now we're ready to talk about energy if
you push a block against a spring you'll
notice that you have to fight to keep it
in that same spot it wants to bounce
back in the other direction
similarly if I try and pull on a block
extending the spring it tries to pull
back any other direction now if I let
the block go in either the case where
I'm compressing the spring or in the
case where I've extended the spring the
block is going to accelerate and go
bouncing back and forth which means that
it's gaining kinetic energy and if the
blocks gained kinetic energy that energy
must have come from somewhere and it
turns out that that energy was potential
energy stored in the spring and you'll
notice that the more I stretch the
spring the more dramatically the block
will rebound in other words it'll have
more kinetic energy if I stretch the
spring further or compress it further so
this means that the energy stored in the
spring the potential energy should
probably scale with the distance away
from the equilibrium length and in fact
it does it turns out that we can write
the potential energy stored in the
spring as one-half times some constant K
times Delta x squared and remember that
Delta X is the difference between the
springs current length and its
equilibrium length now this constant K
is something that's particular to the
spring itself it's a measure of how
stretchy or stiff the spring is now you
may be wondering where this equation
came from I'm afraid I'm not actually
going to derive it for you because that
requires calculus but i will say that
it's not a mathematical coincidence that
this equation looks a lot like the
equation for kinetic energy that's a
topic we can discuss more on the forms
all right now I think we're ready to do
a few problems using Springs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
