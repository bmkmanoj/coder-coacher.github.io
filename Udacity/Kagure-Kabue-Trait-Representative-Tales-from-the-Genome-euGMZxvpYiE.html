originally but I live in San Francisco
now I have darkly pigmented skin and I
live in an area that had a high
prevalence for sickle cell anemia well
we're really happy that you are
interviewing with us for the class today
you get to talk to us about two traits
in two different lessons for us and one
of the first traits you know we learned
about is a skin pigmentation and that
the idea that everyone originally all
humans had darkly pigmented skin and
then as we migrated Out of Africa we
went to various locations and because we
needed more sunlight in our skin and the
melanin was keeping it out that many
people started getting mutations that
made them lose melanin pigment in their
skin so the I you know the fact that
you're from Kenya right brings us back
to our ancestral origins all humans
originated originally in Africa and
there are some great fossils amazing
fossils in Kenya in particular and so a
lot of human history really originated
in sort of that region I just wanted to
can you tell us a little bit about Kenya
for those of us who've never visited or
I started say I'm for anybody who's
never been to Kenya what's what can you
like it hot is it well it depends on the
region and so if you're further down at
the coast well first of all Kenya's in
East Africa and it's right under the
Horn of Africa so under Somalia and
above Tanzania and we have the Indian
Ocean to our East so if you're closer to
the coast it's much hotter it's just hot
at the coast especially in January and
we're right on the equator the country
is actually almost split in half by the
line equator line and if you live up in
the highlands like I do which is on the
slopes of Mount Kenya the temperature
doesn't very much so it will only be a
few degrees Celsius different from
morning to evening
and so you can wear a sweater or not if
you want or not and it's beautiful
should check out the Kenyan government
website for more information lots of
lions and vines yeah so if you don't
live on the slopes if you actually live
and I guess closer to the coast maybe um
how hot does it get there I couldn't
tell you off the top of my head but you
know especially with the conversion
rates but it gets hot enough that you
should probably just stay indoors stay
in sight and what about the scenery you
moved to San Francisco is uh is it more
beautiful in San Francisco or in Kenya
each place has its you know its
attractions and some things are more
beautiful here than they are back home
and vice versa but in general it's just
different it's hard to compare the two
because it's so different right um San
Francisco is a city and it has its
appeal in that way and then where I grew
up I lived in a town that had a
pineapple plantation and that had its
charm as well as well as coffee and
waterfalls and all these things so it's
just different yeah do you get to go
back and visit sometimes um I try and go
back once a year but you know ticket
prices airlines were so yeah so
expensive but I'm sure your family loves
that yeah yeah and I like it too right
um so you know there's no stepping
around sort of the the obvious issue
that people in different continents on
the globe have different color skin and
that is caused by the different amounts
of melanin that they have deposited by
melanocytes into the skin itself so give
us some some idea you know in Kenya are
most people do they have dark skin or do
they have white skin I would say most
people have dark skin because it I guess
it's is it a sliding scale what'swhat's
dark skin and what's not dark skin but
most people would probably be on the end
where your skin is considered dark
and that's just how I grew up with
everybody around me looking like i did
with slight variations in shade but
pretty much yeah it's interesting that
you put it like that um I mean you know
I'm someone who's lightly pigmented and
and I don't remember exactly when I
noticed like people I grew up in an area
that was probably about fifty percent is
sort of like either you were either
lightly pigmented or you were darkly
pigmented and I remember I was probably
on a middle school when I started
realizing sort of oh you know you know
we don't the same color skin you know
when you grow up in an area where most
people have the same color skin do you
is there a certain age that you sort of
noticed differences you know with other
people either you know where you were
living or even outside where you were
living well I had the advantage or
disadvantage of going to an
international school when I was younger
and so there were a lot of Europeans or
people who were both European and
African descent and so I don't know when
I first realized the difference I don't
remember except maybe when I came here
and the absolute opposite was happening
where I was suddenly the minority
whereas where I grew up people with
lighter skin pigmentation we're the
minority and so I don't know I think
that was my first time to actually you
know realize is when i moved here in
2008 that oh my goodness this plane is
full of people who do not look like me
mm-hmm so you moved from a place where
you were the majority to a place where
you were in the minority and I think
historically speaking you know there's a
lot of interesting questions in the
nexus of you know just the human
condition and how people treated others
with different skin colors over time is
you know could have many courses about
that but in Kenya in particular is there
any I mean how do people think of
Europeans let's say or in generally
people with lightly colored skin overall
historically what are the how do people
put that into the con
how do people treat people with
different color skins and think about
that in the context of history well
historically Kenya was colonized by
Europeans last law to being the British
and so there is something to say about a
European coming back into the country
I'm not sure I can't speak for all
generations and all people but there are
certain attitudes that prevail and some
which are more dominant in certain
generations than others for example
you'll have people who believe that a
European or someone with lighter skin
pigmentation is meant to be in charge
because of that history of colonization
and then there's the other end of that
match itude where someone else might
think to themselves I don't want to see
someone who looks like that in charge
because of the history and all the bad
things and may have been associated with
the colonization and then there's people
outside of the country who look to a
country like Kenya and say we need a
European or an outside force to act as
the face of the country to show that it
can be run well because you know there's
histories of violence and corruption and
all these other things in Africa in
general and so there's there's different
attitudes and then I hope I'd hope to
say that with the younger generation it
doesn't matter as much although it's
still something that you would notice
and an education from another countries
usually considered something of value
but that that may not be a skin
pigmentation thing for example myself
getting an education here and then going
back there would hopefully give me a leg
up and that's the idea behind it but
then there's also the idea of myself and
someone with lighter skin pigmentation
of European descent having the same
education or the same exact background
as I did growing up in Kenya coming here
going back there it's like who would get
the job in why
and in that case I there's the idea of
this person with lighter skin
pigmentation might get that job that I'm
buying for because they would act as a
better face to someone outside the
country who might look in and see oh we
can use this person to represent what we
want I see wow that's complicated but
that's just one of the things that could
happen there's so many attitudes and so
many other things that could or could
not happen right it seems that um you
know skin color such an easy trade for
people to latch on to you know they
associate lots of other things with it
and historically I think this is mike
has always been true do you think that
in general and you can speak from your
perspective growing up in Kenya or even
from your experience in San Francisco do
you think you know your generation or
the current generations perspective on
skin color is different from past
generations in a better or worse way I
think it's I think it's better but it's
also very complicated because it's that
sort of love hate relationship that
comes with a country or people who have
been enslaved or colonized where you end
up either identifying because you
identify you connect those two traits
you'll connect the wealth and the
success to the skin pigmentation and so
I hope to think that in a reverse
situation where skin pigmentation
someone with darker skin pigmentation
had colonized the country that was full
of like an African person had gone
chuckles ulu went to I don't know
Britain or something and colonize them
that the opposite would happen and
everyone would be outside trying to tan
and I don't know I don't know that would
happen but you know I like to think that
that's how this is broken down it's not
because one is better or worse than the
other is just historically there has
been a correlation or a connection
between these two and so people have
tend to identify one with success and
one with failure it just so happens that
that's how it went down at this period
in history I really like that thought
experiment that's
like a thought experiment to do um what
so even within Kenya you know growing up
uni said most people are at darker skin
you know do people still distinguish
obviously you said to it's a spectrum I
mean do people still distinguish
culturally you know between a really
dark ursuline personal versus a-- maybe
not as dark skinned person right well
there are people do because we have many
tribes in Kenya and certain tribes will
have certain features that that are more
prevalent in their tribe and if a
certain tribe has more dark darker
people who are darker a lot more people
who are have darker skin pigmentation
then when you see someone else who has
that same coloring you'd think to
yourself oh they must be from that tribe
and so that's how which isn't always the
case you can sometimes you know in one
try and find someone who's lighter or
darker than you'd expect them to be but
in general people use those signifiers
to categorize others this actually uses
an identifier for purposes yeah um even
though there aren't as you know there's
not as big a difference in the spectrum
between what's I mean you on the color
or pigmentation spectrum we could be
treated very differently as you said you
know by different people in different
cultures or different backgrounds um
just because of that do people treat
people differently in can you two even
though you know there's not maybe as
much of a difference in skin color our
do is there still that kind of even I
guess we should say discrimination that
happens even based on more subtle
changes I would yes sort of it's not
blatant this one I don't think it would
be discrimination I think it would be
because certain people associate these
traits with positive things or negative
things and so if I personally thought to
myself oh that person has all these
identifiers they have lighter skin
pigmentation they have a hair that's a
little bit straighter than I think to
myself oh they must be from the north
eastern part of Kenya
there they have Somali blood in them or
something like that and then then from
there after having identified them with
a certain tribe or such a group of
people then personally what do I think
of those people and so if I thought to
myself oh I love Somali people then I
would try and make friends of that
person versus maybe someone else was
like oh I can't stand them and then you
know whatever happens from there on so I
don't it at that point it depends on
what the attitude is of the person or of
the people in a certain area towards
others at that point in time sure and
actually it's really interesting you say
it like that I mean when you move to San
Francisco and you see you know okay now
you're part of a minority group and do
people you know use skin color in the
same way as far as signifiers in in the
San Francisco area I mean you know the
same way that you say I mean where
you're from you can use it as like an
indicator you know maybe what region and
individuals from did you find that
people do the same thing in San
Francisco or do they or not I'm
surprisingly oblivious to it like I
think because I've grown up being used
to not having to think about whether I
was the only person who look the way I
look in a room I tend to do the same
thing here I'll walk in somewhere and
think to myself oh why are they looking
at me I must have something in my ear
something in my teeth I should have
brushed my teeth before I left a house I
don't think to myself oh my goodness I'm
the only person in year was darkest skin
pigmentation and so it takes me a while
and so I can't I don't know I have no
idea someone else would have to watch do
you think of skin pigmentation or skin
color as a positive or a negative trait
I don't think of skin pigmentation as a
negative or a positive thing it does
have its advantages in some situations
so if you have darker skin pigmentation
you go out into the Sun a lot more than
someone who doesn't then you are less
likely to get to cancer skin cancer do
you think of skin color skin
pigmentation is a positive or negative
trait in any way
I think skin color can have positives I
don't think of it as negative or
positive specifically but I do know that
when I go out in the Sun I have the
advantage of not burning or I know that
I'm less likely to get skin cancer than
someone with lighter skin pigmentation
now on the other side they do know that
if you do need the Sun in order for your
body to produce vitamin D and in that
case if you have a higher skin you have
darker skin pigmentation then your lips
you're more likely to not have the
ability to produce enough vitamin D
right exactly and I know that there are
some people who actually have to take
vitamin D supplements or they have to
actually be told to go out into the Sun
more to get enough sunlight so that they
can make enough vitamin D that's even
true for for a light-skinned people to
sometimes who if you don't get out in
the Sun enough you know I believe even
on ships when people cross the Atlantic
and the fifteen sixteen hundred that was
a thing right they stayed if if you
didn't get enough sunlight they call it
scurvy right it's a vitamin D deficiency
and really the solution is just get out
in the Sun more what are there any other
is there any other positive or negative
aspect do you think sorry should say
this do you think other people look at
skin color or skin pigmentation as a
positive or a negative trait maybe not
so much from the biological side but
from even a social perspective yeah
definitely there are people who who
there are people who think that there's
skin pigmentation is a positive thing or
a negative thing whereas if you're
ostracized or you're discriminated
against for the color of your skin then
you might start to think that it's a
negative thing whereas if it's helping
you in life in general then you'll think
it's a positive thing so depending on
whether you know if I'm making it in
life so to speak because of the color of
my skin then I'm going to be very happy
with my skin pigment
versus if it's the thing that's causing
other people to react negatively towards
me and that's a social thing then I'm
going to start to hate the color and
skin which is terrible because it's it's
a genetic trait that has nothing to do
with who I am on the inside yeah
completely understand that um so as you
mentioned the darkly pigmented people
are way less likely to get skin cancer I
think the numbers like there if you have
lighter skin your 500 times more likely
to get skin cancer do you know anyone
from Kenya who had skin cancer at all
just trying to see if reality bears out
there statistics I don't I don't
personally know anyone mm-hmm is that
ever concerned today I don't know if
that like you know in the United States
you know we have these people are like
I'll put sunscreen on the outside put
sunscreen on make sure you put sunscreen
on do people say that in Kenya no I
don't hear that too much sunscreen is
also expensive so true I think if it was
I think if people there were more cases
of skin cancer the cost would not be an
issue but people just think to
themselves my grandmother lived about it
my mother lived about it I'll be fine
without it probably in Kenya is sickle
cell anemia a common trait I don't know
how common it is but I do know people
who've had it or who happy yeah what are
the symptoms of sickle cell anemia or
what was it like for those people that
you know if we've had it it was
something I didn't know was happening
until they told me themselves with one
person I always thought to myself that
she looked a little sickly sometimes but
I just thought that maybe she had a cold
but turns out that she had or has sickle
cell anemia mmm is it is it a big deal
dumb does it seriously affect their
lives I'm not sure I'm not sure if it
does I I would imagine it does but she's
very private with it and so I don't know
how much it affected her all in all she
seemed to function
only or you know she would show up to
class and go through everything that we
would go through and then I think to
myself oh she's sick again mm-hmm is
anyone no one in your family those ever
been affected by sickle cell anemia no
no no not in my family do you know if
you're a carrier for sickle cell anemia
I do know that and I'm not that's great
does that factor in people's decisions
about you know children to people worry
about that having sickle cell anemia I I
would imagine that in a family where it
was common where it had been running
through the family that they might
consider it but I've never heard of
people getting that test because with
some people they know it's not its more
common in some tribes than it is in
others and so I think in a tribe like
mine where it really happens I don't see
why I don't think they'd factor in
sickle cell anemia or whether they were
carriers are not into who they would
marry do you know of the treatment for
sickle cell anemia I mean it for people
who have it in Kenya as it generally
accessible I mean is it a by mean do
people know about it is it something
that's able to be treated in general for
most people so in a country like Kenya
with a rural population that may be less
literate they would be less likely to
know about treatment options than a
population that was more urban or more
literate not necessarily the same thing
but more literate they would know more
and would have access to treatment so it
depends on the region as well kagari why
is sickle cell anemia in endemic to
regions like Kenya and in Africa I think
it's something that developed in order
to I think it's something that developed
as your body's response or our body's
response to fight or stave off malaria
say I'm say I just
to resistant to malaria it exists well
it exists it's higher in the region
because it also provides some resistance
to malaria ok so it's higher in the
region because it provides resistance
some resistance to malaria I say so
malaria is a common um sickness yes
definitely really I've had malaria
everyone else in my family has had
malaria to really what's it like to have
malaria um you malaria is like the flu
I've never had the flu but from what
people describe the flu as you get dizzy
get nauseous you get achy joints when I
had malaria I remember being very dizzy
dizzy enough that the floor seemed very
far away and like it was teetering and
you're just kind of outfit you get a
fever the usual and how does the I mean
how does malaria spread we'll wrap up
our conversation of skin pigmentation
and what I want to do is just give you
an opportunity to to tell us anything
you might want to share you know a lot
of people have a lot of people think
differently about skin color some people
it's a big deal other people it's not a
big deal if you could give advice or
just say anything speaking to that idea
in people about whether or not skin
color is a big deal or not what would
you say or what advice would you give I
think the advice I'd give is that it
shouldn't matter it would be naive of me
to say that you should ignore it because
others are not ignoring it and so you
should be aware of how others will treat
you but all in all it doesn't it
shouldn't change it doesn't change who
you are on the inside it's a genetic
trait that simply dictates what the
color of your skin and so after that it
may have its biological advantages or
disadvantages but in the end it doesn't
it doesn't your skin color is not your
ethnicity it isn't your race race is a
social construct and so it doesn't
change who your audience
it really shouldn't matter and it would
be great to say that it doesn't matter
but to sum it does my advice would be to
view be who you are i wouldI to be who
you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
