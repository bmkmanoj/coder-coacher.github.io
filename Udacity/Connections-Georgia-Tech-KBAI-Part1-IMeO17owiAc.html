several connections the first has to do
with memory we have often said that
memory is an integral part of the
cognitive systems architecture one can
imagine that a and B are stood in a
memory then c + 1 + c + 2 + c &amp;amp; 3 and so
on our probes into the memory an
equation would then become which one of
these probes is most similar to what's
stored in memory we might decide on that
answer based on some similarity metric
in fact we will revisit this exactly the
same issue when we talk about case based
reasoning later on in this class another
connection we can draw here has to do
with reasoning when we are talking about
the transformation from A to B and then
the transformation from C to one of
these choices one question that arose
was should we make the connection
between the outer circle here and be or
the inner circle in a and B this is the
correspondence problem the
correspondence problem is given to
situations what object in one situation
corresponds to what object in another
situation we will come across this
problem again when we discuss analogical
reasoning a little bit later the third
connection has to do with cognition or
knowledge based AI as a whole notice
that instead of just talking about
properties of objects like this is a
circle and the size of the circle over
emphasis here has been on the
relationships between the objects the
fact that this is inside the outer
circle or the fact that he outer circle
remains the same here the inner circle
disappears a knowledge-based AI and in
cognition in general the focus is always
on relationships not just on objects in
the features of those objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
