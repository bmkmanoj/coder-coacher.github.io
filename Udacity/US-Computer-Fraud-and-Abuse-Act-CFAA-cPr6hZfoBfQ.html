the US laws related to cyber crime and
and illegal online activities the first
one is the u.s. Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act CFAA actually goes back a while but
the goal of this law or this Act was to
define what is criminal when it comes to
things that you do online so various
types of online abuse and then define
criminal sanctions against those kind of
actions or activities that constitute
abuse or fraud so it really covers
unauthorized access to computers so
you're not allowed to be someplace in
the physical world we have laws like
that here we sort of trespassing
somebody's computer that is connected to
the internet and we can reach out to it
so computer obviously has things of
value that you are after if you happen
to be the cyber criminal that's who is
being targeted by this law so I said it
goes back a while initially it was
rather narrower it was trying to protect
it sort of motivation came from national
security national defense it's saying if
you gain unauthorized access to a
computer that has data related to
national defense that is illegal this
was then extended to financial data
because people do care about their money
and criminal cyber criminals actually
after money they want to steal your
online account or steal credit card
information and so on if you access
either defense-related of financial data
and an access it's unauthorized CFAA
says that that's an illegal act so what
exactly is unauthorized access
unauthorized access essentially is
getting hold of this data gaining access
to it so that's remember when it came to
data we had the confidentiality
integrity and availability requirements
that we had the CIA requirements that we
had to find when you talk about securing
data so gaining access to it you able to
see the data that you shouldn't be able
to see use it for example of financial
gain
modification is affecting its integrity
corrupting it destroying it is exactly
that disclosure is to anybody who's not
authorized to see it and so on if all
this is done when the system under
consideration happens to be a garment
system well that's how CFA started so
this basically saying the law sort of
covers access to information its
modification we're not allowed to do so
and using that information any shape and
form destroying it affecting
availability that's what you would do
with this is illegal so this one
initially was something that is operated
by or on behalf so it could be a
contractor the US government but this I
said this has a history this was
broadened to include any computer they
said actually the language any protected
computer this basically a protected
computer is any computer that's
connected to the Internet so protected
computer if you access it without
permission and gain access to the data
or destroy it or RuPt it while you're
committing an illegal act it then
actually keeps getting more and more
specific or transmitting code or malware
malicious software that can damage a
computer
well that's illegal as well and finally
it specifically addresses passwords that
are used to gain access to computers so
if you steal a truckload of passwords
and want to sell them in the black
market
the underground market that's
trafficking in computer passwords and if
you did that that would be illegal as
well so accessing data that's not yours
in various forms
you know infecting computers with the
malicious software trafficking and
passwords that allow others to gain
access to computers that are protected
all those things you are covered under
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act that we
have in the United States</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
