they are very general trainable model
that maps variable length sequences to
fix lengths vectors in fact thanks to
the sequence generation and beam search
that we've just discussed they can also
be made to map fixed length vectors to
sequences start from a vector not be to
the state of your Arnon then produce a
prediction then sample from it or use
beam search and feed them back into the
yarn end to get the next one now you
have those two building blocks and you
can stitch them together it gives you a
new model that map's sequences of
arbitrary links to other sequences of
arbitrating lengths and it's fully
trainable what can you do with this many
things imagine that your input is a
sequence of English words and you output
a sequence of French words you've just
built a machine translation system all
you need is some parallel text imagine
that your input is sounds and your
output words you've just built an
end-to-end speech recognition system
real systems based on variations on this
design exist and are very competitive in
practice that you require a lot of data
and a lot of compute to work very well
we've also talked about commnets which
basically map images into vectors that
represent the content of that image so
picture what would happen if you took a
cough net and connected it to an RNN you
have an image going in and a sequence of
things coming out a sequence of words
maybe maybe the caption for that image
to do that you need training images and
captions there are a few data sets out
there that you can use for that most
notably the cocoa dataset it has images
and crowd-sourced
captions for them you can train a model
that uses a cognate to analyze the image
and generate captions from them and it
works you can get great captions
generated completely automatically and
it sometimes fails in very very funny
ways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
