templates and what dynamic segments are
in a route let's take what we've learned
and start building out our app wait a
minute remember we don't want to create
routes and template files by hand we're
too lazy for that we'll use ember CLI to
create everything for us instead let's
generate a route that will handle things
when the URL is / menu so we'll use
embers generate command but remember
that generate has an alias of just G so
I'll use that since it's shorter and we
want to generate a route and we want
that route to match the URL menu this
command did a number of things for us
we'll skip these first two for a second
and come back to them notice that the
generate command we just ran modified
the router file it added this line here
this menu route will call the menu Jes
route file and then load the menu jsh BS
template it also created a file for
testing this is why ember CLI is so
incredibly awesome it did all this for
us with just one command so the generate
command at adjusts this line to the
router this menu route loads the menu
routes file then it loads the menu
template will come back and look at
these files in detail soon but first
let's add some content to the template
file so we can see something in the
browser I've added this HTML here with
headings and images for a few menu items
I've also included the image files in a
bit of CSS back in the browser we don't
really see anything hmm when working
with routes and templates make sure
you're actually loading the correct
route adding menu shows us the template
awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
