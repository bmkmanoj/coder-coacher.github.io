relationship between these different
attributes that I mentioned of
performance extensibility and protection
or safety a dance like structure that
does not pay attention to safety or
protection meets the two attributes of
performance and extensibility a
microkernel based approach achieves
protection and extensibility but may
have issues with respect to performance
a monolithic structure may yield good
performance has protection but it is not
easily extensible now what do we want of
course we want all three of these
characteristics in an operating system
structure but can we have all of these
three characteristics in an operating
system in other words what we would like
the operating system structure to be
such that we get to this center of the
triangle that caters to all three
attributes performance extensibility and
protection and the research ideas that
we will study in this course module is
looking at ways to get to the center of
the triangle so that all three
attributes can be present in the
structure of the operating system we
will resume the course module with
research approaches that have been
proposed then that we will cover in this
course module that help us get to the
middle of the triangle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
