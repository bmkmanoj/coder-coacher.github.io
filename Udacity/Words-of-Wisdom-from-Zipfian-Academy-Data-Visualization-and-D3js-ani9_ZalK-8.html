a 15 Academy and I want to take a step
back before we dive too much into detail
about data visualization I really want
to get your guys insight into sort of
the background of students and what it
takes to be successful in creating two
data visualizations so I guess for you
Jonathan what sort of things do you want
students to know after their time at
sithean yeah it's a great question Chris
and seeing so many students work on so
many projects here at zipping coming
from a diverse set of backgrounds I
would say the most common hanging up by
sea with students is focusing too much
on some complex analysis or optimizing
some model without thinking about the
larger process as a whole and I often
like to tell my students your greatest
insight is only as good as your ability
to communicate it so if you spend weeks
optimizing the model to be ninety-nine
point nine percent accurate but don't
think about how someone might use it or
derive some value from it it's basically
useless interesting and for you Ryan I
guess what sort of things do you think
students need to know in order to be
successful in creating data
visualisations yeah I think data
visualization is really interesting
because it's both an art and a science
so students not only need to know how to
code to work with the libraries and
explore their data but they also have to
have a really good sense of visual
design and storytelling to craft
something that's compelling to the
audience we're going to cover both
aspects in this course in order to
prepare students to think really
critically about the visualizations they
create great thanks so much guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
