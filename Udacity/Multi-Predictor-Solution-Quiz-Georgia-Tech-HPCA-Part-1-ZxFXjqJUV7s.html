predictor quiz where we have a program
for which the two bit predictor works
for many instructions p share covers
some additional instructions and g share
covers the rest that p sure doesn't
cover but all of them can correctly
predict the same branches that the two
bit predictor can so because the two bit
predictor covers the most branches and
it's the cheapest predictor what we want
to do is use the two bit predictor for
most of the branches so the correct
answer here is a hierarchical predictor
that chooses between a two bit predictor
and a predictor that combines the
picture and G sure so what this first
part does is it basically makes most of
the branches just go to the two bit
predictor so that the space in the more
expensive predictor here will be
reserved for only the branches that
actually need to go there because the
two bit predictor is not predicting them
correctly because P share and G share
have different strengths and neither of
them is clearly superior to the other we
are not going to combine them using a
hierarchical predictor we are going to
combine them using a tournament
predictor that will choose between P
share and G share so the correct answer
is that the overall predictor is a
hierarchical predictor that chooses
between a two bit predictor and a
tournament predictor which itself
chooses between P share and G share or
the other way around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
