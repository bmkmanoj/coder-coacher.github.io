spurred the adoption of classless
inter-domain routing or cider which was
adopted in 1994 the idea is that instead
of having fixed network ID and host ID
portions of the 32 bits instead we would
simply have an IP address and what is
known as a mask where the mask is
variable length and indicates the length
of the network ID so for example suppose
we have an IP address like 60 5.14.2 48
0 / 22 well in this case our 32 bits
look like so but this doesn't tell us
how long the network ID and how long the
host ID should be the / 22 indicates the
mask length which says that the first 22
bits should represent the network ID now
the key is that this mask can be
variable length and the mask length no
longer depends on the range of IP
addresses that are being used this
allows those allocating IP address
ranges to both allocate a range that's
more fitting to the size of the network
and also not have to be constrained
about how big the network ID should be
depending on where and then the IP
address space the prefix is being
allocated from of course now the
complication is that it's possible to
have overlapping address prefixes for
example 60 5.14.2 48 0 / 24 overlaps
with 60 5.14.2 48 0 / 20 - the red
prefix is actually a subset of the black
one so supposing these two entries both
show up in an internet routing table
what are we supposed to do the solution
is actually to forward on what's called
the longest prefix match meaning that if
a routing table has two overlapping
entries that it should forward according
to the entry that has the longest prefix
or the longest mask length intuitively
that makes sense because the prefix with
the longer mask length is more specific
than the prefix with the shorter mask or
the larger prefix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
