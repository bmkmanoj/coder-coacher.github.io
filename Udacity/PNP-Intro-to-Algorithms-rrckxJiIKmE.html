these are exactly true and none of these
are exactly false this is kind of a
fuzzy problem but there are there are a
lot of cryptographic protocols that are
based on on factoring like problems that
are in NP NP is a is a good source of
secret-keeping algorithms for the same
reason that NP problems are good for
puzzles that is to say you might be able
to look at an encrypted message and not
be able to figure out where it came from
but if I give you the secret information
behind the scenes you should be able to
read it so the people who have the key
should be able to decode the message in
other people not so there are definitely
cryptographic protocols based on
factoring if when it's shown that P
equals NP we actually have an algorithm
that runs very quickly to solve all
problems in NP then this would
definitely be true a lot of CSD
irritations will be out of work they
will find something interesting to do
I'm not very worried about them they're
they're very smart people they will you
know presumably not work directly on
this problem anymore but there's really
only a handful of people who spend a lot
of their time directly on this they're
usually working on side problems that
they hope will build up to a solution to
this problem and whether this makes
computer smarter than people or not I
really have no idea my my own research
area is in artificial intelligence and
machine learning and there is definitely
a lot of problems that we encounter that
are NP type problems that we don't have
fast solutions for if we could solve
them quickly that would be great
but I certainly am of the belief that if
the computers can solve it quickly the
human brain probably can solve it
quickly too if we look at it the right
way and for now most of the problems
that that really seem to stumped
computers these NP type problems people
seem to be able to do in practice rather
well so if anything it might help
computers become similarly smart to
people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
