pattern is a literal a and now what is a
pattern well it's a function it's no
longer a tuple and so we can apply that
pattern to a string and we get back the
set of the remainders so it says yes we
were able to successfully parse off a
off of a string and the remainder is a
string we can define another pattern
let's say pattern 2 equals plus of
pattern pattern 2 is also a function and
we can call pattern to of let's say the
string 1 2 3 4 5 a's followed by a bee
and now we get back this set that says
we can break off any number of A's
because we were asking for a and then
the plus of that the closure of a and
these are the possible remainders if we
break off all of the A's or all but one
or all about three and so on so
essentially we're doing the same
computation that in the previous
incarnation with an interpreter we would
have done with matched set of pattern
too and then the string now we don't
have to do that now we're calling the
pattern directly and so we don't have
matched set which has to look at the
pattern and figure out yes the top level
pattern is a plus and the embedded
pattern is a lit instead the pattern is
now a composition of functions and each
function does directly what it wants to
do it doesn't have to look up what it
should do now an interpreter we have a
way of writing patterns and that
describes the language that the patterns
belong to in a compiler there's two sets
of descriptions to deal with there's a
description for what the patterns look
like and then there's a description for
what the compiled code looks like now in
our case of the compiler we just built
the compile code consists of Python
functions and there are good target
representations because they're so
flexible you can combine them in lots of
different ways you can call each other
and so on so that's the best unit that
we have in Python for building up
compiled code there are other
possibilities compilers for languages
like C Jenner
code that's the actual machine
instructions for the computer that
you're running on but that's pretty
complicated process to describe a
compiler that can go all the way down to
machine instructions much easier to
target Python functions now there's an
intermediate level where we target a
virtual machine which has its own set of
instructions which are portable across
different computers Java uses that and
in fact Python also uses the virtual
machine approach although it's a little
bit more complicated to deal with but it
is a possibility and we won't cover it
in this class but I want you to be aware
of the possibility so here's what the
so-called byte code from the Python
virtual machine looks like I've loaded
the module discs for disassemble and dis
dot this takes a function as input and
tells me what all the instructions are
in that function so here's a function
that takes the square root of x squared
plus y squared this is how Python
execute that it loads the square root
function it does loads the X and the two
and then does a binary power loads the
why and the two doz the binary power
adds the first two things off the top of
the stack and then calls the function
which is the square root function with
that value and then returns it so this
is a possible target language but much
more complicated to deal with this type
of code than to deal with composition of
functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
