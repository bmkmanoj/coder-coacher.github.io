value 1 and X equals mu that goes to 0
and X goes to an plus minus infinity and
it so happens it looks like a bell curve
the fact that looks like a bell curve is
not entirely obvious but you have to
take my word for it so this what I would
consider a relatively simple formula
describes the limit of making infinitely
many coin flips and in fact it describes
the limit of computing a mean over any
set of experiments it's a very powerful
result no matter what you do when you
drive n to very large numbers you get a
bell curve like this there's one floor
here and I'll tell you about the floor
without going into detail that is the
area underneath this curve doesn't
always add up to 1 in fact without proof
it adds up to 2 Pi Sigma square and the
reason why this matters is deeply buried
in probability theory but it turns out
we want all these areas to add up to 1
just as much as we wanted a coin flip in
its complement to add up to 1 so the
true normal distribution is normalized
by just the inverse of this thing over
here 1 over 2 Pi Sigma square so 1 over
square root of 2 Pi Sigma square so that
is the normal distribution of any value
X index by the parameter mu and Sigma
square so this is a very deep piece of
mathematics now we will apply it a
little bit for you to practice how the
normal distribution looks in the field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
