distribution networks are I'm planning a
holiday trip to India fairly soon and
let's say on the holiday trip I record
some nice videos of some of the places
that I went sightseeing and let's say I
call the content that I generated thusly
Kishore's India trip to keep it simple
let me call the node ID of my computer
as a tea and I want to publish this
video that I generated of my interesting
visits to some of the sights and sounds
of India on the internet so that anyone
on the Internet
can't find it and download it now how do
I name the content of my video
well textual names may not be very
meaningful because there could be name
collisions so what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna create a Content hash of the
video and let's say my content hash has
enough bits to enter uniqueness of the
hash string that I generated I'll call
that the key now I have a key value pair
the key is a bit string that is a hash
of the content of what I want to store
and make available to everybody and the
value is my node ID where the content is
stored let's say that the content hash
turned out to be 149 and my node ID is
of course 80 so the key value pair that
I've generated for my interesting video
is 149 comma 80 149 is the key and 80 is
the value which essentially is the node
ID of my computer where I have the
content in other words the key 149 is a
unique name that I've generated for the
content which I want to distribute to
others that may be interested in looking
at this particular content now if you
get this key value pair 149 80 you know
that 149 is the key that uniquely names
my video it shows India trip and 80 is
the value which says where you can get
this particular video from
so you can then come to my node and get
it from me now the question is where to
store this key value pair so that
anybody can discover this key value pair
if they're looking for key Shores India
trip maybe I've published the fact that
it shows India trip unique name is 149
somewhere and so now if anybody wants to
find a way of locating the server from
which they can download the content they
need to get this key value pair so when
I created this particular key value pair
I have to find a way to place it in the
internet so that anybody can get this
key value pair and from that know the
node from which they can download the
content now we cannot put this on a
central name server because it does not
scale because user-generated content is
proliferating on the Internet so using a
central server to store all the key
value pairs is just not scalable
we need a distributed solution and this
is where the idea of DHT or distributed
hash table comes into play the idea is
quite simple
anyone who generates a key value pair
has to find a location where they can
store it so that intuitively anybody
that is looking for that particular key
will be able to discover it so if I want
to store a key value pair what I'm going
to do is find a node whose ID is exactly
the same as the key itself or if not
close enough to the key that I want to
store so in this case the key that I
generated which is the content hash of
my India trip video is 149 and looking
on the internet I find that that is a
node whose node ID is 150 close enough
to 149 and therefore I'm gonna store
this key value pair 149 comma 80 in this
particular node 150 now if you're
looking for my India trip video you know
that the unique signature associated
with that is 149 and you will know
because of the structure of the DHT that
the place to look for the signature 149
or the key 149
is a node whose address is also equal to
this key value close enough 150 is the
one that is close enough so you'll go to
150 and from 150 you will get this key
value pair and once you get this key
value pair you will know that oh the
content is stored in node ad and then
you can come to me and get the content
from me this is how content distribution
networks exploit the distributed hash
table technology to store content on the
internet so that they can be discovered
and disseminated to the users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
