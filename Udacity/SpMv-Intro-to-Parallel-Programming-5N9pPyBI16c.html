useful never fear
we'll have two good examples in this
unit and cover the first one here and
the second a little later so let's
consider the problem of sparse matrix
dense vector multiplication which we
abbreviate spin v sparse matrix vector
many interesting matrices have lots of
zeros so we call those matrices sparse
and we want to find a data structure to
represent them that squeezes out the
zeros as well as to find a more
efficient way to multiply them by
vectors after all if there's lots of
zeros we'll do lots of multiplications
that have no effect so sparse matrices
are incredibly common in computational
problems in many domains for instance
PageRank is the world's largest matrix
computation PageRank is based on a giant
sparse matrix that represents every web
page in the world how big is this matrix
well if there's n web pages in the world
this matrix is n by n and each entry at
row R and column C is non zero only if
web page are links to web page C so the
PageRank computation on this sparse
matrix is how Google computes the
importance of web pages let's briefly
refresh how we multiply a matrix by a
vector students who already know this
are welcome to skip to the next segment
so we're going to multiply this 3 by 3
matrix here by this 3 by 1 matrix here
so how do we do this for each output in
the output vector we multiply the row of
the input matrix by the column of the
input vector so we do this in a pairwise
way a times X plus B times y plus C
times Z and that will create the entry
here ax plus B y plus C Z for each
additional row in the output matrix we
simply do another one of these dot
products so for instance to compute this
value here we dot product this vector
with again our input vector to get G
times X plus h times y plus I times C so
let's do a matrix times a vector as a
quiz we're going to have this sample 3x3
matrix times this sample 3x3 vector and
I'd like you to write the vector
answer in these three blanks here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
