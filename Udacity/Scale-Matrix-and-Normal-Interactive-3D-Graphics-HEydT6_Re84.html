set all three values here to one and you
get the identity matrix if you want to
uniformly scale something to be three
times as large as before set SX sy and
SZ to all be three if you want to
instead just stretch something up along
the y axis so that it's five times as
tall set SX + SZ to be 1 and sy to be 5
there's just one funny thing that
happens with scaling in particular it
can mess up normals remember we're not
just transforming points with matrices
we're also transforming shading normals
if you run normals through a translation
matrix nothing happens to them they're
vectors so they don't get touched
if you run normals through rotation
matrix things are fine here's a triangle
from a side view looking along its plane
along with its normal if you uniformly
scale this object to be larger look what
happens the object grows larger as does
the normal the good news is that the
normal doesn't change direction so all
we have to do is renormalize it before
using it in any lighting equations if
you non-uniformly scale an object in
other words stretch or squish it things
get weird here I've stretched the
triangle in one direction the normal
vector has also stretched upwards and is
clearly no longer pointing in the right
direction to solve this problem we'll
need to invert and transpose a matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
