and right now these objects are just
kind of floating around we haven't
really talked about how they might be
interconnected so let's add some
connections or we're going to use the
more formal term we'll say let's add
some relationships the relationships
that we're going to add are going to be
ones that we've borrowed from UML and
those are the contains relationship and
the kind of or a kind of relationship
and these are also known by other names
for instance contains might be known as
part of and a kind of might also be
known as is a type of and there's other
variations too so what did these mean
let's start with the contains
relationship like it sounds a contains
relationship is representative of when
an object contains another object if we
think about the world object it contains
robot it contains an alien it's a
background it also has a dialogue bubble
and the badge here but we're gonna leave
those out for now so in our diagram
let's create some relationships between
the world and the robot the alien and
the background so I'm going to go ahead
and move some things around just to make
some extra space and to represent the
contains relationship we'll draw arrows
from the world object to the objects
that it contains and label them as
contains relationships pay close
attention to the direction of the arrows
for these relationships is pointing from
the world to the robot to the alien into
the background and the reason that it
points in this direction is it allows us
to read the relationship by just
following the arrow now we could also
say that the app contains each of the
objects in this diagram but if I'm going
to add an arrow for every single object
in our diagram it could get a little
hard to follow so to keep our diagram
simple we just want to add that contains
relationships from the app to the most
high level objects by high level I mean
objects that are bigger in the sense
that they have more complexity about
them so for instance the world object is
at a higher level than the alien object
in the sense that it probably has more
functionality contained within it
another way to think about it is that
the world probably plays a bigger role
as part of the app then the alien does
in general you want to keep this going
from the most high level object
like in this case the alien adventure to
the lower level objects so for instance
an alien adventure consists or contains
a world world contains a robot robot can
contain a badge and we can add a
relationship for that later
now the distinctions that we're making
here in these relationships that we're
adding again they're completely up to
you where I'm using a contains
relationship between the world and the
alien you might use something else or
you might not even have a relationship
at all or you know where I'm labeling
this as a contains relationship I might
not even have that I might even remove
alien adventure because the world is
kind of the most high-level object and
you know by the title here we know that
we're talking about the alien adventure
app but again it's just personal
preference you can do whatever you want
to so moving on let's talk about the
other relationship the kind of
relationship this is one of my favorites
it's used to describe objects that have
similarities and it also involves a
little bit of abstract thinking for
instance let's think about the alien and
the robot they're actually pretty
similar the robot and the alien can
animate we saw that the robot could move
across the screen and the aliens
animating right now and they're both
able to speak to each other so in a
sense they're a little bit like actors
in a play now this is the abstract part
the aliens and the robot are like actors
in a play then why not add an object to
our diagram that represents an actor I
mean that sounds pretty good to me an
actor is an object that can be animated
and participates in discussions and just
like we said both the alien and the
robot are kinds of actors and that's how
we'll add this kind of relationship
we'll start by adding an actor to the
diagram and then we'll add relationships
from the alien to the actor because an
alien is a kind of actor and from the
robot to the actor because the robot is
a kind of actor and I hope you've
noticed that for these kind of
relationships the direction of the
arrows again we're going from the alien
to the actor so it reads very naturally
an alien is a kind of actor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
