are able to be aware of both our
internal world and our external world
this is what we mean by consciousness
and we vary in our level of awareness
and arousal throughout the day for when
we awake to one we sleep sleep is vital
for healthy functioning both
physiologically and psychologically it
allows our body to restore itself after
a long day of activity in addition sleep
aids us in memory consolidation and it
helps us learn dreaming that occurs
during REM sleep also assists in brain
growth and development humans have a
long history of taking psychoactive
drugs to change our consciousness and we
have many reasons why we take drugs
including recreational social spiritual
and medical or psychological reasons
depressants like the barbiturates
benzodiazepines and alcohol depressed
central nervous system activity
therefore they can cause relaxation and
decrease anxiety opioids are very
effective in treating pain stimulants
like cocaine and methamphetamine
increased sympathetic nervous system
activity cannabis has been used
medicinally but it can also cause
perceptual distortions the hallucinogens
like LSD and psilocybin produce profound
changes in perception finally although
MDMA is also used recreationally it is
showing promise as a new treatment for
post-traumatic stress disorder
psychoactive drugs produce their effects
by interacting with receptors such as
dopamine and serotonin receptors and
they mimic are naturally occurring
substances produced by the brain such as
our endorphins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
