ready with the next event and that's
depth perception Susan over to you well
some of our senses are off preparing for
the next event
shortly they're going to be asked a
series of questions to determine their
depth perception in Susan can you
explain to our viewers at home what you
mean by depth perception right depth
perception is our ability to perceive
how far away something is from us and
it's all because we have two eyes right
sure some of our depth perception cues
are binocular meaning two wide cues the
idea here is that each of our eyes takes
in a slightly different version of the
world and our brain puts that
information together however not all of
our depth perception cues are by not
ours isn't it looks like the competition
is about to start
and we're going to let our viewers at
home participate in this event too so
we'll get back to you with the results
in just a minute
that's right learn so we're going to
show our viewers at home the same
questions that are being shown to our
contestants so sit back enjoy and see
how you do on the depth perception event
in the sense Olympics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
