screen is you formulas that tell you how
to compute the probability that a
particular action a is the optimal one
given some evidence which I'm calling D
sub a that is D is the data the set of
labels the number of the times you've
said yes or no for a being the optimal
action in both the general case where
there can be any number of policies that
are optimal that is any number of
actions in a particular state that could
be optimal versus the case where there
can be only one
the Highlander case okay so I'm just
gonna kind of read this out to you and
you just ask me any questions you want
but we'll sort of see where it goes so
we should read the first equation in the
following so all of these are for a
particular state and you just can apply
this in every given state because we're
living in Markov decision process land
and we'd have to worry about all the
other states we can just worry about the
state we happen to be in this is the
probability for a given state action a
is the optimal one given a sequence of
labels that say yes this is optimal no
this is not optimal is equal to this
quantity C is just the probability the
human is correct which was point eight
in our last quiz and was one in the quiz
before then raised to the power Delta
sub a now what is Delta sub a well Delta
is just the difference between the
number of times you said yes and the
number of times you said no to action a
now what does that really mean well
remember as you said when you were kind
of thinking this out loud for the first
one that what we really got is
multinomial in binomials now I'm a by
known that's a special case of
multinomial so we really have a small t
notice what we're really doing is
flipping coins so every time you sort of
flip a coin you're getting some evidence
of whether the the coin comes up heads
or tails more often and so what you have
here is a delta basically is a
sufficient statistic that summarizes the
entire sequence that you get now what
this means in practice is that every
time I say yes and no it's as if they
cancel each other out they drive me back
towards the uniform distribution or
whatever your prior happens to be now a
lot of people find that difficult to
wrap their heads around it feels
like if I flip a coin twice and it comes
up heads once and tails once that's
evidence that it's a half but if I flip
a coin a thousand times and 500 times it
says yes and 500 times it says no that's
somehow more evidence that it's a half
and that's true but actually in both
cases the maximum likelihood answer is
still one-half it's just in the second
case you're even more confident about it
and what we're doing here is we're
measuring basically the mean not the
variance does that make sense yeah I
think so
right so it's in some sense it's not
telling us how sure we are of the answer
it's really just saying what the answer
is the best guess as to the answer
exactly right and and what this Delta
kind of summarizes for you is the only
thing that matters is how many times you
said yes versus how many times you said
no not how many times you said yes on
its own so in the general case what
we're really saying here is something
kind of neat which is that we can we can
treat every single action as if they're
independent and so the probability that
a is optimal depends only upon what you
told me about a it doesn't depend upon
anything else because as we did in the
first example if you tell me that the
first action is optimal but all of them
are could be optimal there's multiple
optimal policies then the fact you told
me something about that action doesn't
actually tell me anything about any of
the other actions and so what we have
here is basically the probability that I
would see that many times you've said
yes normalized by the probability I
would see that many times that you would
say yes versus I would have said all
those times and been wrong about it so
see to the Delta a is a sort of under
the assumption that you are correct and
one minus C is under the assumption you
were not correct and that just falls out
of the binomial distribution and if we
plug in our original answers you would
see that you end up with the same thing
that we got before in the special case
where you've only seen one label you
with me yeah that's cool that's yeah I
think so so because it's the the
binomial case one per action we're not
looking at any of the other actions so
the denominator there comes from
essentially the the count of how likely
it is that we'd have those that number
that Delta number versus that if we were
wrong we would have that Delta number
the 1 minus C so yeah I think that that
feels right to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
