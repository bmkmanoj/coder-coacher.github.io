done so far we've gotten really nice
clean answers because we have gotten
answers that don't have a remainder
we've gotten a zero when we complete our
final subtraction step down here now the
reason this happened for every division
we've done so far is that each of the
things we've divided our original
polynomials by have been factors of
those first polynomials when we divide
by a factor there's nothing left over
from the original expression that this
doesn't go into but what happens if you
divide by something that isn't a factor
well then we get some number down here
instead of 0 whatever number we get down
here is as I said before called the
remainder but if the remainder isn't
equal to 0 we have some more stuff to
think about let's see what happens
earlier on we are working with the
function f of x equals x cubed minus 4x
squared plus X plus 6 that when we are
looking for roots or zeros we try to see
what happens when we let X equal one we
found out that plugging that in gave us
four since when we plug this in we don't
get zero we know that one is not a zero
of this polynomial and that means in
turn that X minus one is not a factor I
wonder what would happen then if we
divide this polynomial by X minus one
let's find out here I've written out all
the different boxes you're going to need
to fill in to complete this long
division so please write what belongs in
each one and then write your final
answer up here please note that I've put
subtraction signs and then parentheses
around boxes so make sure that you write
the expression that belongs inside here
given that the subtraction sign is
outside also don't forget to bring down
your ex and your six from the original
expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
