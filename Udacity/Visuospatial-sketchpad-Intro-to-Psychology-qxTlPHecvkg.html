visuospatial sketchpad this is
responsible for visual and spatial
information try this close your eyes are
they closed okay now tell me how many
rows of dots there were on the screen
okay open your eyes
were you right so for this example the
sketch pad provides storage for
information that's visual such as images
or photos in this example you are using
your visual spatial sketchpad when you
are trying to remember how many rows of
dots there were on the screen the second
part of the storage system is the
episode ik buffer this is related to the
storage of information that will become
long-term memories of specific events
and finally we have the phonological
loop as the name implies it's our memory
for sound or linguistic information now
if we want the information that we've
learned to last and become a long-term
memory we have to rehearse it and this
is called rehearsal as the name implies
rehearsal is the process of practicing
or reciting the information to ourselves
now go back to the example the letters I
wanted you to remember your visible
spatial sketchpad allows you to see the
numbers in your head your phonological
loop allows you to hear the numbers and
you'll need to rehearse the letters if
you want to retain them for later use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
