Bob and Carol also had if he uses a
simple or a naive algorithm to solve
shortest tour then this algorithm will
not deliver an acceptable running time
because what a simple algorithm would do
to solve shortest tour is that algorithm
would simply try all possible orderings
for the houses so what I just asked you
to fill out in the last quiz the
computer will just go through all
possibilities of saying this is the
first house to visit this is the second
house house to visit and then go to the
following house as the third house and
so on so we have not even need to go
deep into the details to see that this
algorithm will quickly fail once the
number of houses grows because the
number of possible orderings here will
grow enormously with n where n is the
number of houses so let's do a little
quiz to make this more explicit so what
I would like you to tell me is if we had
five houses to visit not counting the
base where we start from and get back to
but five houses where we can decide in
which order to visit them how many
different ways are there to visit five
houses and then how many different ways
are there to visit ten houses and you're
going to need a program or calculator
for figuring out at least the second one
the first one you can probably do in
your head but for this one you already
need a computer to calculate the number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
