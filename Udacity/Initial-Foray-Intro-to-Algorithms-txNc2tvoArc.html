that works if that worked let's let's
see if we can figure out how so what
we're really looking at here is a graph
even though I had you write your
initials it's just some arbitrary graph
that's written in the plane and we know
that it's written in the plane because
whenever two edges cross each other
we've marked that as a node so that
technically the edges don't cross each
other anymore and then we used oil errs
formula which says that the number of
nodes minus the number of edges plus the
number of regions equals 2 but you'll
notice that I kind of defined region
differently in this trick in boilers
formula the number of regions includes
the giant region outside but here I was
just capturing the closed region so
that's why it's one instead it too so
this should always work one of the
things that could go wrong is if your
initials somehow have a just a loop by
itself so I'm not exactly sure what
happens in that case but I think that we
end up getting one additional segment
and one additional region so as long as
you count this as one segment I think
it's okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
