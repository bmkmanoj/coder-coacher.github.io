kilometers to miles and it wasn't too
difficult since we knew the relationship
between the two sometimes they'll be
intermediate steps so let's say you had
a conversion chart with a whole bunch of
unit conversions for example here we
have relationships between miles and
kilometers and yards and feet and meters
centimeters millimeters and then what
the heck I started talking about volume
and gave some conversion factors between
gallons cups and leaders now let's say
you want to convert a distance that you
knew in centimeters to a distance in
feet just a few things you could do one
option is you could start with
centimeters convert to meters then
convert from meters to yards and then go
from yards to feet or maybe you want to
go from centimeters to meters and then
four meters to kilometers then maybe
from kilometers to miles miles to yards
and yards two feet in general there's a
lot of ways you can perform your unit
conversions in this case I'd prefer
option one because it involves fewer
steps but option to isn't wrong let's
practice this with a problem let's say
you're having a party again and you want
to serve 26 guests and you think that
each of them are going to drink five
cups of juice but the juice you're
buying is sold by the leader how many
liters of juice should you buy and your
answer in this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
