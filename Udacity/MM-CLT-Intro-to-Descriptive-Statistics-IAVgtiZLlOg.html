as the population mean and the standard
error should be the population standard
deviation divided by the square root of
the sample size which is about one point
five six so remember since these are the
theoretical mean and standard error
based on all possible samples of size
five from this population they probably
won't get exactly the same standard
error as what we found but they should
come pretty close so let's see what they
got the standard error of the mean
computed using this formula derived from
the central limit theorem is Sigma 3.49
divided by the square root of our sample
size 5 so that's 3.49 divided by the
square root of 5 or n that comes out to
be roughly 1.5 6 if we took the true
standard error of the mean in other
words computed the actual standard
deviation for all of the sample means we
just took that value is 1.57 very very
close to that given by the formula in
checking the distribution of sample
means the sampling distribution of the
mean here was approximately normal not
perfectly normal but pretty close so all
in all we see the central limit theorem
works and provides us a useful tool that
will use for the rest of the semester so
hooray for the central limit theorem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
