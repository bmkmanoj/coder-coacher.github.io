objects to make them look highly
realistic or for that matter highly
stylized for static objects in
particular those that aren't moving
the idea is to pre-compute shadows
reflected light and any other lighting
effects desired for example you can see
in this scene that the smaller cube has
a subtle realistic shadow effect on the
larger one this type of effect is
difficult to compute at interactive
rates this is how the process works
first here's a scene without any
lighting applied every surface is
assigned an additional texture called a
light map this extra texture will be
used to capture the lights effect some
offline process is done to the
illumination in the scene as much time
as desired can then be spent at
determining how much light reaches each
pixel on each surface the results are
stored in the light map the light map is
a mosaic texture holding many different
surfaces illumination calculations for
example the lower left corner of this
light map is for the ground plane you
can see the two shadows of the cubes
laying on it when the objects are
displayed the fragment shader takes the
objects color texture and multiplies it
by the corresponding light map texture
this gives the surface and illuminated
look here's the final result note that
it's the same or darker than the
original image without illumination this
is why light maps are sometimes half
jokingly called dark maps since they
lessen the overall light in theory you
could bake the lighting into each color
texture itself instead of using a
separate light map texture while
possible this can quickly get expensive
one major advantage of light maps is
that they can have a much lower
resolution than the texture on the
surface itself and can be stored in a
single color channel instead of three
rather than storing six high resolution
textures per cube in the scene each with
the lighting baked in just one texture
and six small light maps are stored for
each</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
