certain types of understanding what's
going on the brain is with what's called
physiological measurements and so again
using animals typically what you'll have
is you have a screen where a certain
display certain things are being
displayed an animal whose head is
restrained so it's looking at a
particular direction and there's
actually an electrode recording from the
neurons in the brain you hook that up to
an ant flyer in the old days you'd look
at it on a sillas cope and actually you
just connect it to a speaker and you
listen and more clicks meant you were
getting more response and you have to
write it down and report it then you had
an oscilloscope that had traces now of
course it's all computerized alright
you've seen this picture before this is
a picture of what it looks like for a
microelectrode to be recording from a
neuron and up on top this is what the
actual voltages look like these spikes
and so then down here you have something
that just sort of counts the the spikes
that go across so one of the first areas
that people want to look is what was
called v1 back the old days it was
actually called area 17 I think but that
sounded too much like UFOs or sun i dono
its v1 the first visual area and when
you record from the first visual area
and here's an example the way you get a
monkey to look in a particular place is
you give him juice whenever he pushes a
button when something happens and he so
he'll attend very carefully there and it
happens he pushes the right button he
gets juice and apparently monkeys really
like apple juice but while you're doing
that you're doing other things to the
visual field and one of the things they
found is that there are cells that if
you put up a bar if you put the bar
let's say horizontally you get hardly
any reaction at all in fact put it up at
a 45-degree still hardly any reaction
put it up vertically in this case and
you get a tremendous amount and by the
way again this is the part where it's
off this is the part where it's on this
is the part where it's off now for this
particular trace I don't know if the bar
was moving at all or just being flashed
up there the movement I'll show you in
just a minute but the idea is that
within v1 the first visual area of
cortex there are cells that are
extremely sensitive to the
orientation of essentially edges
remember we did oriented edge detection
so this feels an awful lot like oriented
edge detection it would be an
oversimplification to say that's what
it's doing but it's related if you
recall we also talked about motion well
it turns out in v1 you also get
directional selectivity all right so
here we have a cell and these of course
are the spike trains in this particular
cell if you have a bar that's almost it
a little bit in moving upwards you get a
small amount of motion if you have a bar
that's here on this 45 degree angle and
you moved it upwards you got a lot of
spikes what's remarkable is when you
move it down you got no spikes at all or
even less than resting state spikes so
not only do we have orientation
selectivity we have movement selectivity
and you can actually make a pretty cool
plot of how this distributes in the
brain and so this is this is essentially
I guess this is your brain on drugs
because I don't know anyway it's all
colored but the idea is that each of
these colors represents these different
orientations and you can get these
mappings and you can see that it's not
randomly scattered individual points
there are regions all right and in fact
these were referred to as hyper columns
in the sense of that little tissue areas
within the brain will all be associated
with a particular movement now remember
it was retin-a topic so this area is all
from one part of the retina sure but
within that area there'll be little sub
parts that are four verticals and
oriented edges like that including
different kinds of motion so those were
the kinds of things that people saw in
these first visual areas there was a
group of neurophysiologist Hubel and
Wiesel at Harvard who I think they'd
work in cats originally where they first
looked at these some of these cells they
also looked the thing called XY cells
having a steady state in motion and they
won the Nobel Prize for this work okay
so this idea of trying to understand how
the visual cortex was processing the
visual signal was really
in fact that Nobel Prize was announced
during when I was in grad school so it
was in the 80s at some point so it gives
you an idea of sort of the recency of
some of this work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
