that you're considering this course now
before we dive in I want to introduce
myself and also share with you two
reasons why I'm really excited to teach
this course first I love teaching
before joining Udacity I was a sixth
grade science teacher in India I
remember really enjoying presenting new
ideas to my students that would make
them question what they already knew
that experience led me to pursue a
master's degree from the School of
Education at Stanford University the
second reason is that I love to create
things with programming now in this
course we're going to use the Python
programming language to create a bunch
of projects and my hope is that you
would want to share these projects with
your friends here are some of them the
first one is project take a break do you
know a friend who works too many hours
hint that person could be you we will
write a program that schedules breaks
throughout the day reminding that
individual to listen to music get up and
dance to their favorite song or just
walk away from the computer every once
in a while another one is called Project
profanity editor imagine you get an
email from your boss requesting your
help with something
you'd apply I can take a shot at it but
accidentally you end up including an
awkward word oops we will write a short
Python program that detects curse words
and saves you from embarrassing moments
in the future the final project is
project movie database in this project
we will learn how to make an awesome web
page that lists your favorite movies and
shows their trailers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
