number of conditions or has a number of
conditions that define it so P is
defined as being the class of all
problems that can be solved in
polynomial time on a deterministic Ram
and next time for example is defined as
the class of all problems that can be
solved in exponential time on a
non-deterministic Ram now when you want
to arrange those classes into a sort of
hierarchy then you always have to think
about which conditions are more
restrictive than others and I hope it's
clear by now that determinism is more
restrictive than non determinism so
basically we can say non determinism is
stronger than determinism of course this
is very hand wavy so don't show this to
a theoretical computer scientist but for
here it's okay to think about it that
way now what about exponential time in
polynomial time I think that is a very
clear one so exponential time clearly
should give you at least as much power
as polynomial time and this basically
gives us the hierarchy because
polynomial time is clearly the most
restrictive one and non deterministic
exponential time clearly the most
powerful one so we can already say here
that P goes into the very inner circle
where ask next time goes out here now
what about NP and exponential time on a
deterministic machine when we talked
about non determinism we already found
out that polynomial time non determinism
can always be simulated in exponential
time determinism which means that
exponential time on a deterministic
machine is at least as powerful as
non-deterministic time on a polynomial
time machine so NP goes into the second
circle here and X time into the third</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
