on the Left chart zero starts with s
goes to I haven't seen anything yet but
I want an E and I'm starting from chart
position zero it'd be really nice if
after all T tokens in the input we've
got I have totally seen an E and I'm
done with it now starting from position
zero and the input so I know the start
of parsing and I know the end of parsing
but there's a slight huge massive gulf
in here the excluded middle of parsing
that I just don't know how to construct
if only I had some intuition for it
let's go see how that plays out we need
to know how to make additional entries
in our chart for example we have s goes
to dot e what do we do
can we bring some more stuff in in the
examples I've shown you we've added a
few more things to chart position zero
I'm gonna formally tell you how to do
that I'm gonna formalize it using some
abstract mathematics let's say that
we're looking at chart position I this
means we've seen I tokens in the input
and one of the things currently in that
chart is the following par state s goes
to e + dot e coming from state J this
dot means we're expecting to see an e in
the future hmm this is the future this
is the past so I'm going to need to look
in our grammar for all the rules that
start with e because if he goes to
elephant then I should be expecting to
see an elephant in chart state I if he
goes to eggplant I should be expecting
to see an eggplant in chart state I we
need to find all of the rules egos to
something in the grammar and somehow
bring them in so let me make this very
generic to handle all possible
situations let's say that we've got X
goes to a B dot C D coming from position
J in chart I normally for grammars I
always draw non terminals in blue and
terminals in black but I'm gonna leave
this a b c and d i don't know if they're
terminals or non terminals i don't know
what they are in fact they may even be
empty a may be nothing B may be nothing
I'm going to be as generic
I can to handle all the possibilities so
I'm not pinning these down to being
either terminals or non terminals but I
do note that our dot is right in front
of C so I'm gonna look in my grammar for
all rules C goes to something a could be
empty B could be empty PQ R could be
empty or they could be terminals or they
could be non terminals could be anything
so for every such grammar rule C goes to
P QR C goes to anything kumquat and that
doesn't start with the C C goes to
Chevallier
we believe ultimately that we're gonna
see a C in the future if C goes to
carbon then we should expect to see
carbon in the immediate future but we
don't want to forget that we made this
decision
starting in chart state I that
conceptually there were I tokens before
us that we're sort of forgetting about
or putting off to the side because even
though it looks like this dot is right
to the left there are I tokens we've
already seen in order for us to get to
this point so we add C goes to dot P QR
we haven't seen any part of C yet but we
think we might it's a possibility we're
leaving our options open we came to this
idea from chart state I that's how many
sort of hidden pieces of input we're
alighting before the dot we add that to
chart I we do this for every grammar
rule that starts with a c if there are
five grammar rules that start with a c
we're gonna add five things to chart i
formally this operation of bringing in
everything that c could become because
we're expecting to see a c is known as
predicting i predict that because we
want to see a C and C goes to cantaloupe
that we are going to see a cantaloupe
it's also called computing the closure a
more technical term from language theory
we're right before a see any rule that
has C on the left hand side should be
brought in to close the state so that
all possibilities are considered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
