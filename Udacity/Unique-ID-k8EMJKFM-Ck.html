push and set value is the best option
for adding new shopping lists to the
firebase database but let me show you
why instead of just telling him right
here is where we have our list of
shopping lists this is all the data for
one list and here's all the data for
another list and for the sake of space
I'm not drawing out the whole tree for
every single shopping list using the
three other methods besides push we need
to choose what to use as the key for
each of these objects a reasonable
approach might be to choose the name of
the list as the key consider a scenario
where we've written the code for user
accounts and in this scenario we'll say
that both my roommates Walter and cougar
a have their own user accounts and we'll
say Walter has one list which is named
grocery list and cougar a has one list
which is named party supplies and
they're represented here let's decide
that at some point while using the app
kagura decides that she wants to make a
list called grocery lists for herself
it's completely separate from Walters
grocery list that he's made for himself
at this point if we're using keys for
names we'd run into the issue of having
two lists that have the exact same name
and therefore the exact same URL
location so what would happen well if
there aren't any permissions that are
protecting lists from being overwritten
kagura's list could simply overwrite
Walters Walter would probably not be
super thrilled to find that his list has
been randomly overwritten if we had
permissions that kept users from
overriding other users data then cougar
would be in this position where she's
being denied to write a list called
grocery list so maybe if cougar I was
feeling particularly like she really
wanted a list called grocery list she'd
make something like grocery list 1 and
the next person could make something
like grocery list 2 and grocery list 3
and so on this isn't the best user
experience and this is kind of silly
just because one person has a shopping
list named grocery list that doesn't
mean that nobody else using the app
should also have a list called grocery
list another option is to not use list
names as keys and instead to try to find
something else that is certain to be
unique enter push push generates a
unique ID for you to store a list under
and it ensures uniqueness here are some
examples of what push key
look like they're sort of bizarre
collections of numbers and letters via
fire-based magic this ordinary string
has the extraordinary attribute of being
completely unique
so when Kagura wants to add her grocery
list push will generate a unique key for
her thus allowing for both Walter and
Kagura to have grocery lists okay so
hopefully right now you agree that using
push is a good choice
now push only generates this key so you
also need to use set value to actually
generate and store this value here what
I want you to do is update this button
so then it adds a new shopping list to
the firebase database and if I keep
adding lists I should see my data
growing here now you could watch me do
it but you're a developer so why not try
yourself I'll send you a spec oh and
actually in addition to implementing
push could you also add a timestamp
created property it should store when
the list was created it's always good to
keep track of these things before you
get started you probably want to go
ahead and flush the database you're
making a big enough change right now
that having old data could create errors
or confuse you to quote unquote flush
the database you can go to the dashboard
and delete it it's scarily simple just
click this little red X obviously in a
production app and a lot of times when
you're in development this could be
really disastrous so if you're worried
that you might want to revert back to
the data set that you had before you
could always export your data here it
spits it out as Jason and then if you
ever need the data back you can import
it here but this is sort of throwaway
data Oh what
where did my shopping list go Lyla
got to go but also do for the spec right
away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
