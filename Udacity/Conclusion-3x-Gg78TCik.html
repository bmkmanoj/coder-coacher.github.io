computers were these strange things you
put in a separate room you loaded
software on them from something you got
in the mail and you printed the output
on paper they were clearly abstract
tools for uncommon tasks nowadays all
these devices talk to each other and to
us they're part of our daily lives and
provide all sorts of value from looking
up movie times to calling a taxi or
talking face-to-face with a friend
across the globe and yet much of how we
interact with computers is still
abstract and specific to the device at
hand in fact many people view the future
of computing as devices everywhere
floating screens animated graphics on
every surface cats and dogs living
together pandemonium but that's not what
we mean by ubiquitous computing because
it's not the device or the app that's
the most interesting thing here the most
interesting thing is solving real
problems for real people and then
providing that solution anywhere and
everywhere they'd want or need it that's
what we mean by truly ubiquitous
computing when we build for real people
technology doesn't become more visible
it becomes less visible it blends into
our lives and frees us from learning
obscure ways of doing things so that we
can focus more on what we're doing not
how we're doing it we hope you've had as
much fun learning the design principles
and building blocks for these new form
factors as we've had teaching them now
go out and make the world an even cooler
place to live in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
