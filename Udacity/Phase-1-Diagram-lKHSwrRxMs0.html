results of our analysis model there were
classes corresponding to our three major
elements and then there were
associations among the elements there
was one binary association having to do
into actually displaying the contents
and there were two other ternary or
three-part associations that indicated
how the this how the three components
work together to make sure that the
scroll bar affected the lines on the
screen and that the size of the scroll
bar handle and the position of the
scroll bar handle were all right now in
analysis uml supports the idea of
associations in design there are no
associations and programming languages
there are no associations instead there
are in UML what are called dependencies
so part of our process here will be
going and taking these associations and
translating them into dependencies also
the comments which describe the
guarantees in the previous picture have
been translated into or they have the
ocl constraints which we developed
during the analysis phase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
