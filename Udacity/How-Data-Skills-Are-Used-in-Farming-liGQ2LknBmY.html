fourth-generation farmer here in Colusa
California
I currently farm with my family and
we've been farming the same ground for
over 100 years
every year we there's a little bit more
innovation we call it precision farming
but but big data is is this truly data
analysis is how you can process and how
you can take in every bit of information
you can every single day we're using
almost every level from from algebra all
the way to higher end statistics or or
calculus to figure out not only the
mapping chemical rates but also just
truly the estimation of your product in
your state versus other products from
other countries and how those might
influence how buyers choose your product
over something else 930 billion dollars
is lost each year in either wasted food
or or over produced food it's it's
really been interesting to see a a
market in which people need food how do
you not produce too much and how do you
get it to the in consumer much quicker
and so it's been a really fascinating
use of data whereas for a grocer or a
distributor or a or any kind of a
middleman between the farmer and the
consumer anytime lost any minute lost is
is value lost there's truly billions if
not hundreds of billions of dollars on
the line
we're label to look at every single
sector of every single field to say what
did each portion of every field do how
did it do what could it use more of what
could he use less of how we can be more
productive with every square inch of the
same ground that we've been farming for
for generations there's so much data out
there it's just a matter of how do you
utilize it simply
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
