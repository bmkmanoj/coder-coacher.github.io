work well if we did the clothes here
that would work as long as there's no
exceptions the problem is what happens
if we had an exception on the writing
well that would jump to the except
handler we'd never close the file so
maybe it's better to do the clothes here
well then that would close the file in
the case where there's an exception but
if we didn't also close it here it
wouldn't close it when there's no
exception we could try to do it here and
for this code this may be the best
answer other than none of the above
where we get into troubles if we close
the code here is if say inside the
exception block we exited which would be
a fairly common thing to do if we don't
want the program to proceed if it can't
write to the file it would also be a
problem if we weren't able to open the
file which is probably the most common
reason for the exception well then
there's no file to close so we've got a
problem none of these work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
