to work with the human outside of us
they may move for instance and just in
general if you were somebody out there
who was interested in building the robot
to kind of work alongside human what
would you suggest that that person do
well I think that you know just like
we've been talking about in terms of the
specifics of you know maybe what we're
doing it can tell you oh the first thing
is understanding what's the problem
you're trying to solve
right so the example I gave is okay we
look at this patient population and
understand what are the challenges today
same thing that applies anywhere right
any problem you're trying to solve
understand what are the real challenges
today right so in other words what that
means is not start with the robot okay
and okay here are the features that we
want to build into this piece of
technology this device but let's look at
the problem space that we're working in
let's understand you know what we're
doing or not doing what are the
challenges that people actually have and
try to set up that question in such a
way that you know we get real answers
right in other words we're not trying to
project what we think we can or can't do
onto that but actually try to get some
answers from people about what's
happening and one of the real problems
that need to be solved this is so I have
a question for you Cory so typically
when I'm getting ready to build anything
I end up doing research and my research
always leads me down this rabbit hole
where all of a sudden I'm like well I
just need to build something really
quick to do X right let's say for
instance I want to build a robot like
robot head okay well I just want to
build a robot head really quick so I bet
you I could do this with like cardboard
and maybe some toilet paper tubes and
I'm probably okay but then I start doing
some research and I start looking around
and I say well actually you know
catelleya health has a great robot it's
nice it's made of plastic and it's got
nice eyes that move and everything maybe
I should do something in plastic so now
I start looking at 3d printers and then
I say well you know plastic is cheap
maybe I can move over toward something
that's a little bit more you know
durable long term like a piece of like
some metals now I'm looking at learning
how to use a CNC machine and it just it
just kind of spirals forever and I just
never get going what is your suggestion
on how to just get started so you know
learning all those tools and you know
how to work with all those materials
great skill set to have
right but what you have to focus on is
the problem that you're trying to solve
right so the kind of a theme of this
conversation that we've had here what is
the real problem I want us all right is
it figuring out how big this thing
should be and cut a bunch of stuff out
of paper right one small medium large is
it deciding what degrees of freedom us
have the toilet paper tubes and you know
the other cardboard stuff great way to
start mocking that up right next
iteration you know you add some sort of
bows to the cardboard I built robots
that way literally hobby servos and
cardboard put together and even some of
the early studies that I've talked about
in terms of psychology of the
interaction this is how those robots
were built right because solving those
problems don't require a you know
commercially polished robot that I'm
going to sell to a million people I
think one of the challenges is focusing
in on what's the real problem right now
we've talked about this today in terms
of the context of you know business and
prototyping and a number of other
aspects and I think this is something
that's really easy to get distracted
from right when you start talking about
technology until is easy let's do this
one extra thing or wouldn't this be
great to pull in here and wait look at
that right like you're saying and put
that in there the challenge for anyone
building this stuff is how do you make
sure you maintain that focus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
