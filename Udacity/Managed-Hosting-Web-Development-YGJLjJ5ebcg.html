hosting this kind of industry is
changing right now it used to be the
case just a few years ago that you would
rent machines from a data center like
these machines would already be
installed and configure and you can just
you know rent five of them could do all
this online and the industry's changed a
little bit this is kind of new system of
dealing with this which is basically
kind of this managed hosting cloud setup
and that's what I'm gonna focus on here
because kind of in-between guys aren't
nearly as popular as it used to be so
these are players like AWS Rackspace
Linode I think kind of does this sort of
thing there are others these are the
ones I've heard of Reddit and Hipmunk
both use AWS it's my personal favorite
generally the idea is you are renting
machines in the case of Amazon I can't
speak for the others you might machines
by the hour so we pay 10 cents an hour
or something for our machines on Amazon
you don't have to think too much about
bandwidth and power you don't think
about power at all bandwidth you
generally pay some amount for you can
install the operating system if you want
more likely you're just configuring the
OS not installing it you're in the
system where your machines can just kind
of disappear if your machines fail the
hosts may bring up a new machine for you
or they may notify you or you can write
scripts to automate this whole thing
this is the area where I like to live
personally still get control over your
machines in the sense that you can you
know exactly what software is installed
what versions are installed what kernels
installed all of that stuff but you
don't have to deal with actually
installing those machines in our rack
and replacing them by hand and doing the
physical work it's all virtual I've
never seen the servers that host Reddit
and Hipmunk
with reddit we started out renting a few
machines from this managed hosting
provider kind of pre Amazon pre
Rackspace seven years ago then we
started co-locating our own machines and
then when Amazon AWS Amazon Web Services
came out that's when reddit switched to
Amazon in the office and the reddit
office there's a bunch of physical
machines sitting under a desk that used
to actually run reddit 20 or 30 machines
whatever they were</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
