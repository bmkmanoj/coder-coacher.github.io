historically it used to be that building
which is compiling and packaging your
source code today builds are responsible
for so much more they run our tests
combine coded resources from multiple
sources generate documentation cray
multiple build variants publish our
applications and manage dependencies
because of this the build has become the
software factory in which we can
continually change test and release our
apps think of Gradle is the one-stop
shop for defining and integrating all
the parts of your software delivery
process for example for Gradle users the
process that executes some modern IDs
like Android studio or CI front-end
products like Jenkins is all defining
Gradle in this day and age in App Store
Android developer unable to ship changes
into production faster and faster will
fail behind the competition in the end
automation is the key to making this
happen so
why Gradle the biggest reason is that
Google is selected Gradle as the build
system for Android studio in fact
Android studio delegates the entire
process of building Android apps to
Gradle when I hit the Run button Android
studio just sets Gradle in motion and
sits back to watch by learning about
Gradle we can extend this default
behavior to build even more and more
capable and well tested Android apps
obviously Google is full of very smart
engineers and one measure of their
smarts is that they felt they didn't
need to reinvent the wheel with build
systems great we'll solve some of the
most hard problems faced by Android
developers how to automate building and
testing apps to achieve rapid
productivity and how to manage
dependencies and variations that allow
professional developers to pump out
dozens of variants of their apps with
one click or build suite of apps and
deal efficiently with apps that are very
large another key insight is that many
Android developers work in heterogeneous
environments with differing and complex
technology stacks Gradle is the dominant
multi platform build system other
strengths of Gradle include the compact
and powerful build language used to
write its build scripts and the rich
domain model that allows Gradle to
reason about your build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
