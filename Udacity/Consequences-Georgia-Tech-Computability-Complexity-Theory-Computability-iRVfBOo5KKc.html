apparent the consequences of the
uncountability of languages are rather
profound we'll let Sigma be the set of
ASCII characters these are all the ones
you would need to write a computer
program and observe that the set of
strings that represent valid Python
programs is a subset of Sigma star each
program is a finite string after all and
note here that I chose Python
arbitrarily you could choose any
language or set of languages if you
liked well since this set is a subset of
the countable set Sigma star we have
that it is countable thus there are
countable number of Python programs on
the other hand consider this fact for
any language L we can define F sub L to
be the function that is 1 if X is in L
and 0 otherwise all such functions are
distinct so the set of these functions
must be uncountable or in other words
the set of functions from Sigma star to
0 1 is uncountable here's the profound
point since the set of valid Python
programs is countable but the set of
functions is not it follows that there
must be some functions that we just
can't write computer programs for in
fact there are uncountably many of them
so going back to our picture of the high
school classroom we can see that the
teacher perhaps without realizing it was
talking about something much more
general than what the student ended up
thinking there only countably many
computer programs that can follow a
finite number of steps as the student
was thinking but there are uncountably
many functions that fit the teacher's
definition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
