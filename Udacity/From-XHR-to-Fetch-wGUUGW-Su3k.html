for us but as often in life we don't
always know what we want right from the
start
imagine a website that wants to show an
image of the current weather we don't
know what weather is going to be when
the user visits the website in the
future of course we could have loaded
all the images you might possibly need
from the very start but that becomes
impractical really quickly so let's talk
about ajax ajax is a group of web
technologies that let you make requests
programmatically with javascript instead
of navigating and effectively reloading
the entire website XML HTTP request or
xhr for short is the most common way of
doing it right now the API of xhr is
arguably confusing and outdated compared
to what javascript offers nowadays that
is what we are going to skip talking
about xhr and use its successor instead
fetch fetch does the exact same thing
but with a cleaner API utilizing
promises and therefore integrates much
better with the rest of the modern
javascript api s if you want to know
more about promises take a look at our
course javascript promises link to in
the instructor notes with fetch you can
utilize all the HTTP methods the
protocol specifies and have full control
of which headers are being sent well
almost all the headers richard is going
to show you a small tool to explore the
fetch API with open up the networking
tab in your dev tools to see if the
browser actually sends the request as
you specified it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
