malware we will discuss intrusion
detection in another lecture here we
want to focus on malware analysis
malware analysis produces information
about a malware that can be used for
detection and response to malware there
are two typical approaches to Melbourne
Alice's the first one is static analysis
in static analysis we look at the
program or the instruction set of the
malware in order to understand what the
malware would do if it is executed that
is we want to understand what a malware
can do without actually executing the
malware there are limitations for static
analysis because some program behaviors
in particular those that depend on
runtime or user input data for example
Chickering conditions cannot be
precisely identified by looking at the
source code or binary code in addition
malware coal can be obfuscated we will
come back to this point later another
approach is dynamic analysis here we run
the malware program and try to analyze
its runtime behavior to understand what
the malware is doing when it is executed
and we can perform dynamic analysis in
different level of qualities for example
we can analyze the malware execution
instruction by instruction that's very
fine-grained or we can analyze the
malware execution by looking at the
system calls that the malware
invokes so that's the so-called system
call a boat racing and that's relatively
coarse grained there are also
limitations in dynamic analysis because
any particular runs of the malware only
reveal behaviors of those runs that is
dynamic analysis cannot provide the
complete picture of malware behaviors in
addition malware can try to resist
analysis by delaying execution wave for
certain input or trigger and so on that
is in any particular run of the malware
the condition may not be right for
certain triggers in the malware and
therefore their part of the behaviors
may not be revealed given the
limitations of both approaches typically
a malware analysis system will try to
employ both approaches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
