we'll move on to vision in general hmm
SR generative models of time series with
some notion of a hidden state that is
they can talk about the probability of
generating particular output the forward
backward algorithms those recursive ones
allow you for computing over the states
and you can also use that computing to
train up your models and I will say that
HMMs were their big win was in
originally in speech recognition dealing
with low-level auditory features and
using that to recover phonemes and then
phonemes in two parts of words and
things like that and then in computer
vision although i will say there's a
whole new area these days called
conditional random fields which is
really better as i mentioned if you've
got a long sequence and you want to do
segmentation conditional random fields
or a slightly more complicated version
actually they're significantly more
complicated for a graphical model of
representing time series and it tends to
do better than HMMs for the actual
segmentation but from the notion of a
generative model of saying is it an A or
a B or C hmm s are still used
extensively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
