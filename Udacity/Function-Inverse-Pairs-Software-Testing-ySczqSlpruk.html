to talk about this is what I would call
a function inverse pair we have
available to us some sort of function
and also its inverse and as a pair and
we can use these as a pair to do strong
checking of correct behavior of the
software under test and see if we
remember a couple of Units ago I gave
the example of where you could test an
assembler by pairing it with a
disassembler and also an exhaustive
enumerator for instruction you could in
coatings and then what we would do is
take all valid instruction encodings
disassemble them into assembly language
reassemble the assembly language into
machine code and do a comparison on the
output so that's what I'm talking about
when I mentioned function inverse pairs
if we think about it we can find these
function inverse pairs a lot of places
so another example is encryption and
decryption compression and decompression
saving and loading of files this isn't
as trivial as it sounds so I'm not
talking about an example where we take
some sort of a bitwise representation in
memory and dump it literally to disk and
then load it again that's unlikely to go
wrong on the other hand many times when
a program saves it states disk this is a
pretty non-trivial operation we might
for example be replacing machine
pointers with some sort of a
non-discrimination and the load
operation is going to contain the
inverse but it's pretty easy to get that
wrong or maybe perhaps we forgot to save
part of the program state and then when
we load it will end up in a different
state will be able to catch that by
treating save and load as a function
inverse pair transmit and receive across
some sort of a loopback interface that
is to say a network interface that
connects the machine to itself conserve
is useful Oracle because in some cases
the non-trivial transformations of data
representation that happen as part of
the transmit and receive operation and
finally encoding and decoding of for
example media formats so this is a final
example of a function inverse pair I
know there must be a bunch of these that
I'm missing because those sort of the
ones that I could think about but these
are the ones I could come up with just
sort of sitting down and brainstorming
for a couple of minutes to of a function
inverse perry use them together and try
to see if you arrived at the original
data of course this may not always be as
easy it seems so for example when we
save pointers to disk and we Swizzle
them into some sort of on disk
representation when we load them the
pointer values may have changed but the
shape of the data shouldn't so some sort
of service so some sort of abstraction
is going to be required to compare the
saved and loaded version similarly the
encode and decode of media files often
involves a lossy encoding step so if we
encode something as a JPEG and decode it
then of course the bits that we get back
are not going to be the bits we started
with but on the other hand this
shouldn't be too different if we can
somehow quantify how
they are then we might be able to use
even a lossy encode decode pair has a
test Oracle for something like a JPEG
encoder and decoder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
