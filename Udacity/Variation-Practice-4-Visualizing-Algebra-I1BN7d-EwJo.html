a foot our gasoline height or level
would be two and seven tenths of a foot
amazing work if you found that one we
start setting up a proportion by looking
at the number of gallons the height and
the square the radius we know the number
of gallons varies directly with the
height of the gasoline level and the
square of the radius since it varies
directly with these two amounts we want
to make sure we list those both in the
numerator and the square part is really
tricky you want to make sure that you
square this radius once we have this
proportion we can plug in the values for
each case and solve for the unknown in
one case the tank has a radius of 5 feet
so we plug in 5 here it holds four
thousand seven hundred gallons here and
it has a height of 8 feet so the height
one is eight in the second case we're
looking for the height of the gasoline
level so that will be H at some unknown
height H the radius will be four feet so
the second radius is 4 and the number of
gallons that the tank will hold will be
a thousand so gallons to is 1000 now we
want to solve this equation for H we
square the 5 and the 4 to get 25 / 16
next we multiply these two fractions
together to get 200 in the numerator and
16 H in the denominator we cross
multiply to get this equation and then
finally we divide by the coefficient of
x to get our final answer we get a
decimal for our answer and we want to
round to the nearest tenth because the
value next to the six tenths is a five
we round up if this value were lower
than five then we would round down and
keep our answer as two and six tenths
but 45 or greater we round up so we get
two and seven tenths this is the height
level for a gasoline tank that holds a
thousand gallons and has a base radius
of 4 feet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
