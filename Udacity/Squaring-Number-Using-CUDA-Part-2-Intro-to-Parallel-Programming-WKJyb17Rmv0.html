line by line so we can all be sure we
know what each call does we're going to
walk through the CPU code first the
first thing we're going to do is declare
the size of the array and determine how
many bytes it uses we then fill it up in
this loop with floating-point numbers
we're array element I is simply set to I
all this is standard see nothing GPU
specific so far one thing to note though
is a common CUDA convention data on the
CPU the host starts with H underscore
data on the GPU the device starts with D
underscore this is just a convention you
can name your variables anything you
want but naming variables in this way
helps you avoid the single most common
beginner error in CUDA where you try to
access a piece of data on the CPU from
the GPU or vice versa if you're
accessing data through a pointer on the
CPU your pointer bed or point to
something in CPU memory or you're going
to have a bad time same thing for the
GPU you'll find lots of CUDA code that
you see uses this convention so let's
scroll up just a little bit and the
first interesting thing that you see is
how to declare a pointer on the GPU it
looks just like a pointer declared on
the CPU it's just a float star now to
tell CUDA that your data is actually on
the GPU not the CPU look at the next two
lines we're using CUDA malloc with two
arguments the pointer and the number of
bytes to allocate CUDA malloc means
allocate the data on the GPU whereas a
plain malloc would mean allocate the
data on the CPU the next thing we do is
actually copy the data from the CPU the
array H underscore in on to the GPU
the array D underscore in this call is
khuddam emka P it's just like a regular
member but it takes four arguments
instead of three the first three
arguments are the same as regular C mem
copy the destination the source and the
number of bytes the fourth argument says
the direction of the transfer the three
choices are cuda memory host to device
cuda memory device to host and cuda
memory device to device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
