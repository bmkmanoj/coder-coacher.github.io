look at next relationships in the class
diagram how they are represented and
what they mean
first of all relationships as the name
says describe interactions between
classes or between objects in my system
and we will describe three main types of
relationships the first one is called a
dependency relationship and we can
express that as X uses Y and we
represent it with a dashed directed line
so when we have such a line between two
classes that means that the first class
uses the second one and we're going to
provide an example of a dependency in a
minute the second type of relationship
is an association that can also be an
aggregation we'll see what the
distinction is but basically what this
means is that we can express that as a X
has a Y so X contains a Y and if it is
an association we indicate it with a
solid undirected line with an
aggregation we indicated in the same way
but with the diamond at one of the ends
finally the third type of relationship
is what is called generalization and
that can be expressed as X is a Y so
this is the relationship that expresses
inheritance specialization between two
classes it's represented with a solid
directed line with a large open
Arrowhead at the end going from the more
specialized class to the less
specialized class so going from the
subclass to the superclass so now let's
look at each relationship in more detail
using our example our course management
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
