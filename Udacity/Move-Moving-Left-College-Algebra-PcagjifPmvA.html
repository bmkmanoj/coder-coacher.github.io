this calculation well if you think way
back to when we did exponent notation at
the beginning of the course we talked
about negative exponents and what they
are X to the negative 1 means 1 divided
by X X to the negative 2 means 1 over x
squared so if we multiply something by X
to the negative 1 we really want to
divide that by X and if we multiply
something by X to the negative 2 we
really want to divide it by x squared so
if we multiply something by 10 to the
negative 4 what we really want to do is
divide it by 10 to the 4th with
multiplication by 10 to the positive for
the answer we got was bigger than the
number we started with but when we
divide by 10 to the four it gets smaller
for each factor of time we're dividing
by the decimal point moves one step to
the left so we start with 3.1 then one
factor of 10 makes it 0.31 and we keep
moving it as before when we end up with
these blank spots we need to fill in
zeros our decimal point is right here
now so what we actually have is as we
saw before 0.0003 one now note that I
put a zero in front of our decimal point
to the left of it now this is the
technically correct way to write decimal
numbers in general if you miss out on
writing this it's kind of like using
slang for everyday speech people will
still know what you mean but it's not
quite as correct it's not quite as
proper in mathematics so now that we've
seen one example using a negative
exponent in scientific notation i'm
going to give you another one to try out
here is 3.1 times 10 to the negative 7
this time try without using a calculator
to write this in normal number notation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
