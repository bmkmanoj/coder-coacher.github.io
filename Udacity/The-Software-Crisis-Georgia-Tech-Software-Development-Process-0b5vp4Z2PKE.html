to the late 60s so what was happening in
the 61 for example the first man landed
on the moon there was also the time when
Woodstock took place and also the time
when the first a 60 second picture from
Polaroid was created concurrently to
these events which you probably didn't
witness in first person there was also
the time when people started to realize
that they were not able to build the
software they needed this happened for
several reasons and resulted in what we
call the software crisis so let's look
at some of the most important reasons
behind these crisis the first cause was
the rising demand for software now
you're used to see software everywhere
in your phone in your car even your
washing machine before the 60s however
the size and complexity of software was
very limited and hardware components
were really dominating the scene then
things started to change and software
started to become increasingly prevalent
so we moved from a situation where
everything was mostly hardware to a
situations in which software became more
and more important to give you an
example I'm going to show you the growth
in the software demand at NASA along
those years and in particular from the
1950s to more or less 2000 and this is
just a qualitative plot but that's more
or less the way things went so the
demand for software in NASA grew
exponentially and the same happened in a
lot of other companies for example just
to cite one for Boeing so the amount of
software on airplanes became larger and
larger the second cause for the software
crisis was the increasing amount of
development effort needed due to the
increase of product complexity
unfortunately software complexity does
not increase linearly with size it is
not the same thing to write software for
a class exercise or the mold project or
a-10 project then it is to build a
software for a word processor and
operating system a distributed systems
or even more complex and larger system
and what I'm giving here is just an
indicative size for this software so the
class exercise might be a hundred lines
of code the small project might be a
thousand lines of code in the order of a
thousand lines of code and so on and so
forth for the former the heroic effort
of an individual developer can get the
job done
so that's what we call a programming
effort if you're a good programmer you
can go sit down and do it right for the
ladder this is not possible this is what
we call a software engineering effort in
fact no matter how much programming
language
development environment and software
tools improved developers could not keep
up with increase in software size and
complexity which leads us to the third
problem that I want to mention and the
third reason for the software crisis and
this causes the slow developers
productivity grow so let me show this
again with the qualitative diagram and
this is taken from a di Tripoli software
magazine and what I'm showing here is
the growth in software size and
complexity over time and how the
developers productivity really couldn't
keep up with this additional software
complexity which resulted in this gap
between what was needed and what was
actually available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
