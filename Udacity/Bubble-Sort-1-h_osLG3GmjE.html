approach like I described before you'll
go through your array comparing elements
side by side and switching them whenever
necessary
let me illustrate with a quick example
we'll start at the beginning and we'll
compare the first two elements if the
first element is bigger than the second
one we'll switch them great we've made
one switch so now we can move on over to
the next two elements looks like we need
a switch here as well all right now we
can move along to the next two elements
and again looks like our first element
is bigger than our second one so we'll
need to switch okay now we can compare
the last two elements in the array and
once again the first element is bigger
than the second one so we'll need to
switch alright now we're done with this
round okay now that we've passed through
the array one time we should count up
the number of comparisons we needed it
took us four comparisons to get through
five elements I think it's safe to say
that our run time for this step was n
minus 1 since the array size was 5 so
with our n minus 1 comparisons what
actually changed there is still not
actually sorted but it looks a little
bit better now the largest element 8
moved up to the end of the array where
it belongs this is actually why this
method is called bubble sort in each
iteration the largest element in the
array will bubble on up to the top so by
that logic in the next iteration the
number 7 should bubble up to right below
8 let's repeat the process again we're
going to start at the bottom and work
our way up to the top looks like we need
to switch on our first step let's move
to step 2 now it looks like we actually
don't need to flip these two for the
first time this first element is
actually less than that second element
so we have nothing to do awesome we do
need to flip 7 and 0 though and the last
two elements are in order so no work
here again we had to do four steps which
is still n minus 1 ok now we're going to
have to do two more rounds of this but I
don't want to bore you with the details
let me show you what the next iteration
of comparisons looks like I did another
iteration but not much has changed I
just had to flip the 3 in the 0
to look like this again the biggest
element left three bubbled up to the
place it belongs but we still have work
to do and again note that this took four
steps so n minus one steps we only have
one iteration left let me show you what
that looks like this time we only had to
flip the 0 and the 1 and we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
