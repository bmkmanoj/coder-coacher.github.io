initially X is 1 and then I define a new
function tricky but I haven't called it
yet so I'm not actually going to make
any new variable spaces over here and
then I print out the value of x well
currently X is 1 and now I call tricky
on X and we noted before that whenever
we make a function call we get a new box
corresponding to that function call and
this one knows who its parents are and
this new box is going to have room for
all the formal parameters in tricky also
X and this time we're passing in X the
current value of x is 10 so we've got
almost a duplicate sort of state so now
we're inside tricky and we say x equals
x plus 5 the real question is which one
do we change and the answer is this
bottom more specific one down here this
X has shadowed has taken the place of in
our hearts the old one so I changed just
this one to six so here when I'm
printing out the value of x we look in
this world we see a six and we print it
out and now we return from tricky and
when we return from a function call you
can imagine we throw away all of its
space and we're back here in the normal
world well what's the value of x here
it's one so this assignment statement x
equals x gets five changed the functions
actual argument but did not change this
more global value of x we call these
boxes that help us keep track of storage
places for variables environments kind
of like before when we were talking
about state being a bit like the world
you can view a particular environment
like Central Asia or Western Europe or
Antarctica as being a little region in
the world that might have its own values
for variables if I want to know what the
temperature is well it depends on the
current environment are you in the
Sahara Desert or are you in northern
Sweden</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
