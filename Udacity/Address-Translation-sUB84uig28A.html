reason the translation has to happen is
because process thinks it has this big
address space contiguous going from 0
through some max and then we said well
the physical memory one process may not
have all of it at the same time or
physical memory may be much smaller than
the address space size itself so logical
address a virtual address is actually
going to be different from the physical
address that we are talking about so
this is actually if you think about it
this is a logical address here and
address is that we have here are going
to be addresses into physical memory
that's your real memory that you have in
the system so what we're gonna do is
we're saying well this part is going
here that part is is going here so maybe
one goes at the top here maybe three
goes down here and things like that we
said we have to take data and code that
is in the address space and we have to
place that into physical memory okay the
way we sort of do that is you don't want
to do it for each byte or each word
because we'll have to keep track of
what's going where right so one way to
scale that processes is that we divide
this address space and the memory into
some sides chunks okay so if you do
paging it's divided into what's called
phases phase typically maybe four
kilobytes for example 4k size so we
would say well the address space really
is a page number and displacement within
that page so this is phase zero and if
you location 10 then it's phase zero
comma 10 okay so zero is the page and
and 10 is displacement within that page
if your address happens to be let's say
4 K plus 3 then it's gonna be a second
page because you're gonna second page
starts at 4 K first 0 through 4 K minus
goes in phase first phase and then the
second one starts so then we'll say it's
page two and maybe displacement five or
two or whatever it is so the logical
address you can think of that as
the pay's number and a displacement
essentially a page table says this it is
a mappings in it so it says this logical
page is currently stored in this
physical page okay so if I want to think
about a page table essentially a page
table we have all these entries and it's
logical pairs 0 1 2 we saying you know
this may be at 3 this may be at 5 this
may be at 8 and maybe 3 is currently not
loaded virtual memory not everything is
in memory at the same time so this is a
page table that actually we build and
the operating system is responsible for
actually building this and and
protecting this remember at this point
sort of a flow that we should understand
it's really important a process may be
executing in user space generates an
address
okay saying I need to fetch the next
instruction that's where my instruction
pointer program counter points or an
operand or whatever it is and I need to
access this memory location it sort of
starts with a logical address the system
now says well where exactly is this
information that the process needs we
need to locate the physical address to
which this logical address maps for that
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take that logical logical address space
number and I'm going to look up this
phase table okay so this address
translation requires that you access
this page table and there ways to speed
this whole process up so I'm saying if
the phase number is 3 or let's say the
phase number is 2 then I go down here
and I said oh it's in physical memory
page 8 so the address that we have if
it's 3 and some displacement D could
translate to 8 in the same displacement
so it's a memory phase 8 and go dig down
in D locations or D bytes in that this
is what is called the address
translation process so important
observation here is that we can only
access physical memory that is reachable
through this page table that we have for
this process I should say
a lot more complicated multilevel you
know things like that but let's just
sort of stay with this basic idea of how
they help us get this isolation which is
important to us because the process has
to start with an address address has to
be translated translation is only
possible through this page table so
whatever the base level points to is all
a process can access another observation
here that we should be clearly
understanding is the page tables have to
be maintained by the operating system
they have to be managed by the trusted
computing base because whatever goes
into the page table we can access that
so the operating system should make sure
that whatever goes in the page table of
a particular process is only memory that
belongs to that process so that's the
address translation gives you a little
bit more information about what part of
memory a given process is able to access
and that's it relates to this isolation
thing that we've been talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
