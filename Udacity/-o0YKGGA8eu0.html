points and vectors essentially a point
is the location in space we represent a
point visually as a dot and given a
coordinate system we can represent a
point by its coordinates in that system
for example in two dimensional space the
standard coordinate system is the
Cartesian coordinate system we represent
a point in the system as an ordered pair
of coordinates first the x coordinate
then the y coordinate so this point
located two units to the right of the
origin and one unit below the origin
would be represented as two minus one in
three dimensions we can represent a
point in a similar way as a triple of
coordinates first its x-coordinate then
its y-coordinate and then at z
coordinate in contrast to a point a
vector is an object representing a
change in position in euclidean space a
vector can be thought of as an arrow
connecting two points the important
properties of a vector in euclidean
space are its magnitude that is the
length of the arrow and its direction
given a coordinate system we can
numerically represent a vector by the
amount of change it represents in each
coordinate direction for example this
vector moves right by two units so we
would give it an x coordinate of 2 since
it moves up by 4 units we give it a y
coordinate of 4 notice that I write a
vectors coordinate representation
differently than I do a points I will
usually write a vector as a column
surrounded by square brackets while I
will write a point as a list of
coordinates surrounded by parentheses
one major difference between a point and
a vector is that a vector does not have
a fixed location if I draw the same
arrow starting at a different point it
will still be equal to the first arrow
this is an important distinction two
vectors are equal if they represent the
same amount of change in each direction
while two points are equal only if they
are located in the same place despite
this difference while studying linear
algebra we usually conflate the notion
of a point and a vector in the following
way given the coordinate system the
point P is associated with the vector
obtained by starting at the or
and ending at the point P while this is
usually a useful mental shortcut it is
sometimes helpful to remember the
difference between the two concepts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
