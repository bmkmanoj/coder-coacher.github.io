complete the square to get this equation
for a parabola that's in standard form
right now to be in vertex form
eventually so the first step to do that
is to first check out whether or not the
expression we have on the right side of
our equation the expression involving X
is in fact a perfect square right now to
my knowledge there's nothing that we can
multiply by itself or at least nothing
pretty to get this so we're going to add
15 to both sides that we can pick our
own constant to complete the square with
on the right side so that gives us y
plus 15 equals negative 6x squared plus
20 since we have a leading coefficient
over here that is not equal to 1 I need
to factor out that leading coefficient
that the right side of our equation
eventually has the form of a coefficient
times some binomial where X with a
coefficient of 1 is the first term so i
simply factor out the negative 6 from
both terms on the right side that we
need to figure out what constant term to
add this expression inside the
parentheses to make it a perfect square
since I know that when I have a binomial
squared the coefficient of the middle
term is just twice the number that we
have at the second term in the binomial
we can find the constant that we're
adding to the end by dividing the
coefficient of the x to the first term
by 2 that I need to square it since i
have c squared as the coefficient on the
end over here and are multiplied out
polynomial that gives me 25 / 9 so
that's what belongs inside the
parentheses here but it's not actually
the number that we're adding to both
sides of the equation that number is
going to be negative six x 25 / 9 it
looks like I forgot my negative science
here multiplying 25 / 9 by negative 6
gives me negative 50 / 3 so that's the
number that we need to add to both sides
once i subtract 50 / 3 from both sides
all the h do is simplify this or modify
its that we get it into vertex form our
final equation in vertex form then is y
minus 5 thirds equals negative 6 times X
minus 5 thirds squared where's our
vertex them well we can read it off it's
at the point five thirds five thirds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
