Jersey square team is doing in figuring
out their revenue streams that is how
much money each segment is willing to
pay and how would they like to pay this
amount so what they discovered as we
found out earlier is that they have two
customer segments for Jersey owners and
single game attendees and as you would
think that the single game attendees
would actually like to pay parental that
is you were gonna rent a jersey for
one-time use from Jersey Square but the
people who already own sport jerseys
kind of like the idea of an annual
subscription and now getting out of the
building they actually talk to enough
customers and have enough data to
realize that these sports Jersey owners
would pay two hundred dollars a year to
get a clean pressed dryclean Jersey for
each game it isn't clear yet in their
customer discovery process how much the
single game attendees will pay but they
intend to talk to more customers and
fill in that data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
