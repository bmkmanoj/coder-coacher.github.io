lesson and that you learned a lot about
the different kinds of professions you
can use genetics with one profession we
learned about is that of a bioethicists
bioethicists are critical in helping us
create new ethical standards and medical
science and research they frequently
debate issues like gene patenting and
they also help us to interpret important
legal issues such as Gina or the Genetic
Information non-discrimination Act
another important profession that uses
genetics but what you don't need an
advanced degree or even a specialized
degree in genetics for is a director of
clinical operations a director of
clinical operations designs and manages
clinical trials and they also use
information from pharmacogenetics to
help inform their decisions about
designing and managing those clinical
trials now another profession
specifically a human geneticist deals
with hardcore genetic questions and
their research sometimes contribute to
clinical trials are carried out by a
director of clinical operations now
human geneticists find genetic factors
resulting in various traits which we've
learned about in lesson 1 as well as
simple traits and lesson 8 and complex
traits in less than nine they also study
gene expression which we learned about
in lessons two three and four and a
human geneticist in particular will
frequently make use of a pedigree
another profession that also uses
pedigrees is a genetic counselor
remember a pedigree is useful because it
denotes family relationships as well as
whether or not you're affected by a
particular trait so it can reveal an
inheritance pattern of a trait you're
interested in and genetic counselors are
frequently helped with family planning
couples who want to have a child and
they're very interested in knowing what
the future of that child might be helped
or otherwise another profession that
uses genetics is a computational
biologist and a computational biologist
is going to use copious amounts of
computer science coding they're usually
specialists in computers specifically
computer science or coding who also
learn enough biology to apply what they
know in computer science and coding now
one of the specific examples we talked
about in our course is how a
computational biologist in particular
can actually derive an IBD score which
is an identity by descent
score which we know can indicate
relatives and ancestry which we learned
about in lesson 7 and 11 but another
important profession we discussed a
genetic genealogist also uses IBD or
identity by descent and other kinds of
information to help find relatives and
ancestry for individuals if you have any
interest in learning more about these
professions and others you should check
out the instructors notes on this page
