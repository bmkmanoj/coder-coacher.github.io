library to ultimately perform many of
the same functions that ListView does
the addition of material design list
item animations necessitated a
significant change in the way adapters
worked the ListView code was already
exceptionally complicated a relatively
monolithic codebase handled layout
recycling selection UI decorations like
dividers scrolling empty view the
decision was made to start over and
produce a more flexible control
recyclerview is focused on doing
precisely what its name suggests
managing the recycling of views most of
the functions of ListView have been
separated into separate recycler view
components and we've added an additional
animator component one of the exciting
ways this is being used is with layout
managers which allows us to create
different pluggable layout experiences
of course we have standard vertical list
views and horizontal lists it's a big
deal if you've been doing Android for a
while it wasn't actually easy to do a
horizontal list grid layouts and this
very cool staggered grid layout manager
which lays out children of different
sizes which supports horizontal and
vertical layout as well as the ability
to layout children in Reverse one of the
key features that recyclerview supports
is custom animations so if we delete an
item the default animator will nicely
animate the closing of the space left
behind and because the animator like
everything else in recycler view is
pluggable we can change it and customize
it the way it works
and because the animator like just about
everything else in recycle of you is
pluggable we can customize the way this
works in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
