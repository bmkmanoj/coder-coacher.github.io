built in a handful of different ways if
you're using an object-oriented language
you could create vertex and edge objects
and give them each properties like name
strength ID number etc a vertex could
have a list of edges it's connected to
and vice versa
however operations that traverse graphs
can be more inconvenient if you need to
search through vertex and edge objects
there are several ways to represent
connections on simple graphs that only
use lists one example is an edge list
which is precisely what you'd think it's
simply a list of edges the edges
themselves are represented by a list of
two elements those elements are normally
numbers that correspond to ID numbers
for vertices so in the end this list is
just showing two nodes that have an edge
between them and an edge list is the
list that encompasses all the smaller
lists because our edge list contains a
list of other lists it's sometimes
called a two-dimensional list or 2d list
if you had a list of lists of lists that
would be called a 3d list and so on an
adjacency list is another way to
represent edges in a graph in an
adjacency list your vertices normally
have an ID number that corresponds to
the index in an array in your array each
space is used to store a list of nodes
that the node without ID is adjacent to
for example the opening at index 0
represents a vertex with an ID of 0 that
vertex shares an edge with one node so a
reference to that node is stored in the
first spot in the array again our
adjacency list is two-dimensional since
it's a list that contains other lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
