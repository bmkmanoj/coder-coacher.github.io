can simply take the following steps
first pick a random switch pair with
free ports for which the switch pair are
not already neighbors next join them
with a link and repeat this process
until no further links can be added if a
switch remains with greater than or
equal to two free ports which might
happen during the incremental expansion
by adding a new switch these switches
can be incorporated into the topology by
removing a uniform random existing link
and adding links to that switch for a
particular equipment cost using
identical equipment the jellyfish
topology can achieve increased capacity
by supporting 25% more service this
higher capacity is achieved because the
paths through the topology are shorter
than they would be in a fat tree
topology consider a topology with 16
servers 20 switches and a fixed degree
of 4 for both the fat tree topology and
the jellyfish random graph in the fat
tree topology only 4 of 16 servers are
reachable in less than 5 hops in
contrast in the jellyfish random graph
there are 12 servers reachable by making
more servers reachable along shorter
paths jellyfish can increase capacity
over a conventional fat tree topology
so while jellyfish shows some promise
there are certainly some open questions
first
how close are these random graphs to
optimal in terms of the optimal
throughput that could be achieved for a
particular set of equipment second
what about topologies where switches are
heterogeneous with different numbers of
ports or link speeds from a system
design perspective the random topology
model could create problems with
physically cabling the data center
network and there are also questions
about how to perform routing or
congestion control without the structure
of a conventional data center network
like a fat tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
