securing access to them because there's
something different about databases well
the structure in the data and how we
access it and we talked with access
control which is sort of something that
we had discussed before so are there
sort of unique kind of attacks that are
possible on databases so that's what we
want to explore next what kind of
threats are possible because either the
structure of the data that we have in
the database or the way we access it
through the query languages like SQL for
example so we're going to talk about a
couple of different possible attacks the
first one we're talking about is what is
called injection SQL injection or we
will see that these are essentially
someone exploiting vulnerabilities in
the code that makes up the query that is
submitted to a database where he is
written SQL and it's an SQL query and
the attack is called SQL injection so
what really is an SQL injection is a
malicious command this is a command that
is presented to the database so that a
database is going to actually run it
malicious because it's going to allow
someone to do something that they're not
authorized to do the results of course
are not going to be consistent with the
kind of security that you're looking to
provide for this database these kind of
attacks injection attacks when
successful they can disclose large
amounts of data we talked talked about
disclosures of customer data and so on
earlier so if you do that of course
you're impacting confidentiality of the
database you extracting data from the
database that is being made public or
going to somebody who shouldn't have
access to it these injection attacks can
also corrupt or delete the data that's
there some set of tuples in a table or
something like that that could impact
integrity of the data so injection
attacks can corrupt which is integrity
or disclose which is confidentiality and
both of these bad outcomes are possible
when it's kind of attacks we can discuss
what they are are successful for us to
understand what these
SQL injection attacks are we have to
sort of learn something else which is a
lot of times the databases are sort of
in the back end of the system the front
end it's some sort of web application
environment that you have okay and the
user interacts with the web application
and presents we're going to do an
example in a minute some sort of request
to the application
well that application then translates to
a query that goes out to the database
and that query is typically generated by
a script based on the user input so user
wants something done provides input for
it there's a script that takes that
input generates a query and then submits
that SQL query for example to the
database so this is the kind of
environment that we're talking about and
what happens is that there is a one-er
ability in the web application itself
this is web application is coded it's
software so there's a software
vulnerability and SQL injection attacks
basically exploit that vulnerability to
craft this injection attacks that we are
talking about okay so just to make this
idea of SQL injections concrete and the
script and the web application and so on
let's do an example okay so the example
is the database that stores data about
you know what it's shipped where and
things like that it's a collection of
the orders for example a company may
have received orders that whenever an
order is placed we create a tuple of
course one piece of information the
attribute in that tuples going to say
where the item is going to be shipped
and this is let's say specified by the
users user says i precising something
and you know i want it sent to this city
the way that web application supports
user interaction is maybe using a form
and and you fill the form with this
needed information including the city
that we're talking about so you the user
interacts with the form fills in the
various fields including the city that
we have here and then we said this web
application now has to pretend rate a
query so the script code that generates
the query is
included the sort of the example here so
the code is going to be a SQL query that
we have to generate so the script
basically saying from the form you read
the user input which is the city where
we're gonna ship a certain item so this
statement ship city is basically saying
you know from the form you read this
value and you know that's if you want to
send it to New York for example that's
what we're gonna have here once we have
that we sang generate the SQL query in
code so the query is going to say select
everything from orders table where the
attribute ship city is what this input
is provided to us okay so we're gonna
add that we will see that the resulting
query is actually going to be select
star from orders table where ship city
is you know if you put in New York City
here it'll be ship City equals New York
okay so that's that's an example I think
the only thing that's important here is
that the user the injection attack the
way it's going to work is that this
somebody is going to provide bad input
so we talked word buffer overflows
through bad input before it's not quite
the same but it's kind of like that and
so injection is going to occur because
of bad input so the idea here is that
you're getting the input here from the
user based on that is generating a query
and this query is what's going to be
submitted to the database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
