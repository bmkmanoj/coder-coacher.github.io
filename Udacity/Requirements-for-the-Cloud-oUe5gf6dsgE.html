the technologies that are used to enable
compute cloud offerings must address a
number of requirements clouds must
provide fungible resources which means
that the resources can easily be
repurposed to support different
customers potential even with different
types of requirements
otherwise if cloud providers have to
allocate and maintain physical resources
for every one of their customers and the
exact same type of physical resources as
with the customers at least think they
require then the economic opportunity
for a cloud computing just won't be
there this venge ability is also
necessary in order to deal with some of
the heterogeneity that exists within the
cloud resources you may have different
generation of servers maybe even
different types of servers and you don't
really want the users to have to deal
with that you don't want them to be
exposed to the level of heterogeneity
clouds must integrate resource
management methods that support the
premise of cloud computing so they must
be able to dynamically adjust the
resources that are allocated to cloud
users depending on the need so this
needs to be done very flexibly very
elastically such management methods must
be able to operate at very large scales
of thousands and tens of thousands of
nodes the scale is important both from
the perspective of the cloud providers
or how many resources it needs to manage
but also from the perspective of the
customers customers often look at clouds
for their resource needs because
otherwise they don't have access to
sufficiently large resource pools so
then clouds must be able to provide to
potential customers the ability to
allocate to really large collections of
resources for their individual needs to
the scalability is required with respect
to that dimension as well one scale is
introduced failures become inevitable
really if we have some probability that
one component in the system will fail
the more such components we put together
the greater the probability that
something in that collection will fail
so we have to incorporate mechanisms to
deal with failures clouds by definition
are shared resources across multiple
tenants so cloud management has to deal
with this multi-tenancy it has to
provide a mechanisms that are guarantee
performance and provide isolation across
multiple workloads multiple tenants we
cannot have one misbehaving tenant that
will somehow take control over all of
the resources and punish and hurt the
performance of the remaining tenants and
finally an important concern that must
be addressed is isolation of the state
that's being accessed in in cloud
systems with this respect
clouds need to make guarantees regarding
the privacy of their tenants data and
the security of the execution
environment that at the cloud guarantees
another aspect of security is also to
make sure that there are privacy and
security guarantees not just across
tenants but also that the cloud provider
isn't going to somehow access or take
advantage of the state that is managed
by individual tenants and then also the
other way around that the cloud
computing player is protected from
certain vulnerabilities that exist
within a single tenant and therefore
that one tenant isn't going to affect
the entire cloud platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
