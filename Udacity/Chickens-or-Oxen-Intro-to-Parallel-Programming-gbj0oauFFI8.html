for this class where I quoted the
American supercomputer designers Seymour
Cray if you were plowing a field which
would you rather use two strong oxen or
a thousand twenty four chickens well I
love the chickens and Dave loves the
chickens and I hope by the end of this
class you'll love the chickens too now
the biggest idea in this course is
parallelism we can solve large problems
by breaking them up into smaller pieces
then we can run these smaller pieces at
the same time parallel computing used to
be a niche technology used by exotic
supercomputers today the world has gone
parallel modern computing products are
like the chickens they have hundreds of
processors that can each run a piece of
your problem in parallel a high end GPU
contains over 3,000 arithmetic units al
use that can simultaneously run 3,000
arithmetic operations GPUs can have tens
of thousands of parallel pieces of work
all active at the same time we call each
of those pieces of work a thread and a
modern GPU may be running up to 65,000
concurrent threads together all this
computing power has the potential to
help you solve your problems faster than
you ever could before but harnessing all
that computing power at the same time in
parallel requires a different way of
thinking than programming a single
scalar processor where you're only doing
one thing at a time
in this class we'll teach you how to
program the GPU allowing you to practice
what we call GPU computing or GPGPU
standing for general-purpose
programmability on the graphics
processing unit more importantly we'll
teach you how to think about programming
through a parallel lens the homework
assignments in this class will center
around image processing applications
frankly they're pretty cool assignments
and with them you'll be able to do some
interesting visual effects at blazing
fast speeds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
