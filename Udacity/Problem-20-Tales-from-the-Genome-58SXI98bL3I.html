straightforward parts of this question
first we have a population of 10,000
where 2,000 or lactase persistent so
2,000 out of 10,000 that's two tenths or
one-fifth but I'm going to keep it in
decimal form here to ten twenty percent
right would be lactase persistent that
leaves eight thousand to be lactase
non-persistent that would be point eight
or eighty percent right that's just
eight thousand over ten thousand eight
over ten eight tenths now we know that
there are 1500 heterozygous individuals
it's telling us that so in the genotypic
frequency we know that out of 10,000
individuals 1500 or heterozygous 1500
over 10,000 is equal to point one five
now to be lactase non-persistent right
this is the recessive gene as I remember
it's autosomal recessive and eighty
percent fall into this category they
must be homozygous recessive so that
means eighty percent of the population
must be homozygous minus minus here so
that would be point eight again so
overall point one five and point eight
is point nine five that only leaves a
genotypic frequency of point 05 for the
homozygous dominant condition here now
there are a couple ways to figure out
this very last bit here and i'm going to
show you the shortcut method that i like
it keeps me from having to double
numbers and move things around too much
the allelic frequency remember we have
two copies of everything and so what I
like to do is hold constant the
homozygous recessive and the homozygous
dominant here and I'm going to take the
heterozygous warm and i'm just going to
split it in half because i know that
half of this number belongs to the
dominant allele and half belong to the
minuses or the recessive allele half of
this is point 0 75 and if i were to take
point 0 75 and add it to hear i would
get point 875 and if i were to take the
other point 0 75 and add it up here I
would get point 125 this still adds up
to one total which is exactly what we
want and so the twelve point five
percent allelic frequency for the
dominant or the plus allele and eighty
seven point five percent allelic
frequency for the recessive or minus
allele</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
