revolutionized a number of industries
and education is no different one of the
real big strengths of mobile devices is
their ubiquity most of our students
already have these kinds of mobile
devices in their pocket right now with
them at all times and that gives us a
real opportunity to create some really
interesting learning activities so for
example the students at a national park
or a civil war battlefield they get out
their mobile device guide them around
the battlefield telling them different
things that happen at different times
complete with animation and voiceovers
so there's real opportunities to create
some really interesting learning
experiences as a new father I'm very
grateful for the use of this technology
in this way because my daughter gets a
phone call from Elmo every day and it
just makes her face light up whenever it
happens so I'm very appreciative of the
possibility to use educational
technology in cahoots with mobile
devices but there are other strings to
mobile devices as well there are
different features that they have their
different anything we dealt with in the
past they have a GPS they have a camera
they have motion sensors and all of
these things can be used to create some
really interesting educational
experiences in different domains so
we're going to talk about in this class
is a lot about how the ubiquity of
mobile devices can be leveraged to
create any experiences but also about
how some of those other features can be
used in other contexts as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
