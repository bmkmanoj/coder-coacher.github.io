reproduce static data simply by shipping
the files or whatever data is required
by the program and we have seen how to
record and replay user interaction
however all of these are actually
instances of the same class of input
that is interaction between the program
and its environment the question is
whether it would be possible to record
and replay this interaction as a whole a
program interacts with this environment
by means of function calls we use
function calls to access data we use
function calls to access user
interaction or generally anything that
comes from the environment so what we
could do is to record and replay
function calls and this way we would
have a single mechanism to capture all
sorts of interaction between the program
and its environment our plan would be to
record every function call with
parameters in a log and then later be
able to replay let's first do the
recording we really have seen our
tracing functions where we can access
the individual execution frames of a run
and we know that each frame contains the
function name as well as all local
variable when a method gets called this
list of local variables is actually the
list of arguments for the function if
for instance I have set up a tracing
function which gets called for every
line as always it also gets called when
a function is called in this case the
event variable up here has a value of
call and if this happens then we print
out the name of the current function and
we print out the local variables which
should be the arguments let's try out
well this works what we see here is we
have a call to the remove HTML markup
function and s has precisely the value
as here in our code we would now like to
turn the function name as well as the
argument list into something that can be
translated back into code we want you to
look precisely like this if we turn this
into a string that looks exactly like a
function call then we can pass this to
the Python evil function which takes a
string and interprets it as code this is
something we will use later for replay
you can see how the string is
interpreted and the result is printed
here's the function that takes care of
the printing of the local variables that
you
the arguments since we don't know the
position of the individual parameters in
the function what we use is we print out
named arguments instead that is we print
out name equals value and this would be
separated by commas now again we remove
HTML markup with this parameter and if
everything goes well our tracing
function should now print out this very
call with the right argument and this is
precisely what happens you see we print
out remove HTML markup with the
parameter s being the string bold foo
and the bold exactly as over here except
that we do have a name parameter and not
a positional parameter the same
mechanism works for tracing arbitrary
calls as long as these are Python
functions so if we call square root of
two for instance this would also get
traced and reported in our output as you
see here here's the call to square root
and X has a value of two now let's
assume that we have a variable which
actually has stored all these calls we
could do so by recording it right away
while the code is executing or we could
also say store this in a file and read
this back from a file your job now is to
write a piece of code that evaluates all
these calls first this one and then the
other one and which prints out the
appropriate results for each of these
called in the form function argument
equals return value over to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
