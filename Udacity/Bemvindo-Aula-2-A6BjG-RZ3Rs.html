at Udacity I worked with Sarah and Ian
and gundega to help prepare this lesson
and today I'm going to deliver it for
you so let's get started up to this
point you've familiarized yourself with
MapReduce you've written some mapper
codes some reducer code and you probably
have a decent understanding of what's
going on behind the scenes but you might
not yet know when to use MapReduce to
solve a problem and that's what we're
going to try and get it in this lesson
we're going to give you a bunch of
problems to solve and actually each of
these problems has been deliberately
selected because each of these problems
actually represents some larger class of
problems in reality the problems you're
likely to run into on the job are going
to fall into one of these certain
classes of problems which is very
convenient because it means you can
apply a sort of boilerplate solution
with some modification these boilerplate
solutions we call design patterns and
they're really helpful in this lesson
we'll learn about some of these design
patterns and we'll practice using them
on various problems we're not going to
get into the details of where the
patterns came from or why they look the
way they do but at the very least at the
end of this lesson you will have well
for one you have practice using these
patterns and you'll also have a resource
that you can always come back to
whenever you run into a problem that can
be solved using one of these patterns if
this kind of stuff is really interesting
to you you should definitely check out a
book called MapReduce design patterns
it's written by Donald miner and Adam
shirk and it's really interesting
anyways let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
