every link between computers were a
dedicated permanent point-to-point
connection then once it was decided that
two machines should communicate it would
be relatively straightforward to arrange
for them to do so the challenges here
are mostly solved by breaking up larger
chunks of data into more manageable
chunks and putting them inside a frame
which in addition to the data payload
would contain some metadata its length
for instance and probably some kind of
checksum as well to see if the data was
corrupted in transmission the situation
becomes much more interesting when
multiple nodes all share the same medium
think of the cable line that carries the
Internet traffic in your neighborhood in
that case we have multiple nodes the
modems in your houses all connected to
the same wire this is called a bus
topology actually the original Ethernet
had this topology though the cable is
all connected to a common hub making it
look like a star topology in reality the
hub would simply relay whatever signal
it got to all the other nodes
effectively making the all the cables
one medium in terms of physical hardware
this is attractive because we don't have
to run wires between every pair of
machines on the local network it does
however mean that messages themselves
have to specify who they are for and who
sent them in the case of Ethernet on a
local area network like a home office or
a server cluster NICs are usually
identified through a unique 48-bit MAC
address max standing for media access
control if you have a router or a modem
at home you can probably find the MAC
address printed on the box on a
unix-like machine you can find your MAC
address of your network interfaces with
ifconfig and then pipe it out to grep
for ether the max source and Mac
destination have designated spots in the
Ethernet frame when the frame is sent
through the medium all the nodes will
receive it but only the one whose MAC
address matches the frame destination
should pay attention the rest simply
ignore it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
