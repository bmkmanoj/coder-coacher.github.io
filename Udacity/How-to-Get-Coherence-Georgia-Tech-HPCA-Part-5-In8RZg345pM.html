coherence and now the question is how do
we get it so how do we make caches
become coherent the first option is
don't do caching but this is really bad
for performance so we will not seriously
consider this but if there are no caches
then all of the accesses go to memory
and then writes to that memory will be
seen by the reads to that memory and
also the order in which the memory
receives the writes is the order in
which the rights will be seen by all the
cores so the system will be coherent the
second option is if all cores share the
same level one cache then the same
argument for coherence applies the order
of writes is the order seen by this
level one cache and all of the accesses
are gonna go to the same cache where
they see the same version of the block
so the system will be coherent but will
still have really bad performance better
than this but not by much now we can try
to do things like having private caches
but make them write through in that case
the memory is actually seeing all the
writes but the problem is that these
caches are still allowed to cache data
that has only been read forever so once
we read the value it doesn't matter that
all the other cores are writing their
values through to memory because the
cache that only reads will potentially
see forever the same stale value even
after many many writes have occurred and
for a long time so this is really not a
way to get coherence even with
write-through caches private caches are
not necessarily coherent what we must do
really is to force reads made to one
cache to see the writes made in another
so we cannot allow caches to simply
provide the same value over and over
once it's a cache hit somehow
once the write occurs in one cache
another cache needs to eventually start
returning that value to its local
processor so how do we do that one way
is for every right to be sent to all the
other caches that might potentially have
this block and they need to update their
value so pretty much
I write to my cash it's kind of like a
right through cash in that it continues
past the cash but now what really
happens to it is not only does it get
written back to memory it also gets sent
and seen by all the other caches which
now take that new value if that happens
then when I write other caches now have
my new value and then reads on those
cores will actually provide the same
value this is called write update
coherence because writes update all of
the other cache copies the other
approach for maintaining coherence is
for writes to prevent other copies of
the block from having hits so after a
write to one cache all of the caches
that had a copy of this block need to
behave like they're having a Miss or
they need to behave like the block is
not valid in that cache so this is
called write invalidate a write will
invalidate all the other copies note
that these are just the two general
approaches we will be looking at several
write invalidate coherence protocols and
also we will be considering a
write-update protocol so this ensures
really that reads see the values
produced by writes so the coherence
property too is maintained by either
this or this so we need to pick one of
these two approaches to maintain
coherence property two for coherence
property three we need to decide what's
the order of writes and all the cores
need to see the same order one way to
enforce the same order of writes being
seen by all the course is that all
writes are broadcast on the shared bus
and then the order in which they appear
in this shared bus is the order that
should be seen by everybody
coherence done in this way is called
snooping because when writes are
broadcast on the bus everybody snoops
those rights in order to tell what order
they occurred on and also to update or
invalidate their values in the caches of
course the shared bus can now become a
bottleneck the other approach is that
each block is assigned an ordering point
and different ordering points can be
used for different
so that for each block all accesses are
ordered by the same entity but different
blocks use different entities so they
don't have contention this ordering
point is called directory when doing
coherence so this family of approaches
is called a directory based coherence
and this directory both serves as an
ordering point for a block and also
figures out who to update or invalidate
when multiple caches have a version of
the same block and a write occurs so
among these two approaches we can also
pick one and indeed all four
possibilities this and this this and
this this and this and this and that are
all possible so you can have right
update with snooping right update with
directory write invalidate with snooping
write invalidate with directory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
