customers for the web/mobile channel so
web mobile works almost exactly like
physical channels keeping customers it's
exactly the same idea you might want to
offer loyalty programs contests and
events blogs RSS and email or social
media all designed to engage customers
while you want to think about keeping
customers is that customers are a lot
more expensive to acquire over here than
they are to keep and the key thing that
you want to worry about is churn or
sometimes called customer attrition and
here's why so imagine if you were losing
5% of your customers a month well in
three years you'd only have about 16% of
them left but imagine if you can reduce
churn to one percent so that every month
only 1% of these customers left so after
36 months with one percent attrition
you'd have 70% of your customers left
just think about it with five percent
attrition your average customer sticks
around for about 20 months but with one
percent attrition they stick around for
a hundred months you get five times more
revenue from the same customers by just
working on keeping these customers
around now by the way in reality
financial people discount the cash flows
from customers later in this life cycle
so the actual value you get is somewhat
less how much less depends on your
industry and cost of capital but we'll
leave that for the accountants in a more
detailed class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
