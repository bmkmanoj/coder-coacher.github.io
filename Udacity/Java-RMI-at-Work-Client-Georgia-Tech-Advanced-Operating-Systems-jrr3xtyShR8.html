at the ease with which any arbitrary
client on the network can access the
server object what a client would do is
look up the service provider but
contacting a bootstrap named server in
the Java RMI system and it does a lookup
of the URL and when it does this lookup
so this URL is published once it is
published then it can look up this URL
and when it does this lookup of this URL
using the facility that's available in
the Java RMI system then a local access
point for that object is created on the
client side and so now we got the access
to the object that is at the server
through this local name account and once
I have that then I can do invocations on
the methods that is available in this
server object by simply calling those
methods I can do a deposit I can do a
withdraw I can do a balance check all of
this they look like normal procedure
calls so far as a client is concerned
but each of this is really a call that
is going out to the server
wherever that server happens to be and
the Java Runtime system knows how to
locate that server in order to do this
invocation that's the power of the Java
RMI the client does not know and does
not care the location of the server and
if there are failures in any of these
function executions then remote
exceptions will be thrown by the server
through the Java Runtime system back to
the client of course with the networked
nature of this client-server
relationship if a remote exception is
thrown and the client sees that the
invocation does not succeed which is the
reason the client saw an exception
thrown it may have no way of knowing at
what point in the invocation the call
actually failed and this is one of the
problems when you have services that you
have to reach across the network and you
have to handle the exception</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
