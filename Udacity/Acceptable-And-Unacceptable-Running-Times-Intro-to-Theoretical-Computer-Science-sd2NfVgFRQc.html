simple algorithm while it's correct does
not show an acceptable running time so
we should probably say a little bit more
as to what we would consider an
acceptable running time like here and
what we would consider an unacceptable
running time and in theoretical computer
science are at least for the first units
of this course we're just making a
distinction between two cases basically
the first case here is polynomial
running time and polynomial running time
means that the algorithm has a running
time that can be stated as some
polynomial of the size of the input so
polynomial time would be an algorithm
that has a running time of oh of n o of
N squared but even an algorithm with a
running time such as o of n to the power
of 10 or worse would be considered a
polynomial time algorithm and we would
say that the running time of this
algorithm is more or less acceptable now
exponential running time those are the
algorithms that have n in the exponent
of their running time so o of 2 to the
power of n would be an algorithm with
exponential running time o of 1.1 to the
power of n would be an algorithm with
exponential running time and also
something really bad such as oh of 10 to
the power of n that would also be an
exponential running time what about an
algorithms such as Oh 3 to the power of
n times n to the power of 2 that would
also be called exponential running time
because as you saw in previous quizzes
the 3 to the power of n is the
fastest-growing term here so the
dominant term here is an exponential
term so running times like this would
also fall under exponential running time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
