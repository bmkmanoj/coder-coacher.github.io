performance versus number of course quiz
if cheap power is a hundred watts and we
can operate one core if that's the only
one on the chip at five gigahertz how
many giga hertz do we get for two cores
and the answer is that each of the two
cores now gets 50 watts that's half the
power the frequency in that case is
going to be the cubic root of that one
half or 0.8 times the original frequency
so we get 4 gigahertz here the frequency
with another doubling of the number of
course is that each gets half the power
of these so it's going to be 0.8 times
this which is going to be 3.2 or we
could do cubic root of one-quarter of
the original five gigahertz and get the
same answer here for execution time we
need to account for the change in
frequency as well as the change in
parallelism so this is what we get we
get 100 seconds when we run all of these
pieces at just one core at five
gigahertz if we ignore the frequency and
have a to courtship then what we get is
that for twenty percent of the time we
get a parallelism of only one with two
cores for the remaining eighty percent
of the execution time we now have a
speed-up of two so that time is cut in
half so we get 0.6 times the original
time if we ignore the frequency so it
will be 60 seconds without the change in
frequency unfortunately there is a
change in frequency 60 seconds at five
gigahertz would translate so we get 60
seconds times 5 billion cycles per
second is 75 seconds at four billion
cycles per second so the answer here is
75 seconds we would get 60 if we
operated at five gigahertz but because
we operated for we need 75 and then for
a fork or execution
get that out of the hundred seconds for
20 seconds we can't improve by running
one more course for 30 seconds we get
the speed up of two because we can use
two cores for 40 seconds the speed up is
three because we can use three of the
four cores and finally for ten seconds
we get a speed-up of four keep in mind
that this is without the change in
frequency so what we get is 50 point
eight seconds and now we have to account
for the change in frequency from five
gigahertz to 3.2 gigahertz so once we
get the 50 point eight seconds that's
without the change in frequency and we
get from five to three point two so when
we compute the speed up relative to this
because of a lower frequency which is
actually slowed down and we multiply
that with this we get seventy nine point
four which is actually slower than a
2-quart executions so as you can see
although the four code execution get
some more parallelism exploited it's not
enough to make up for the lost in
performance due to frequency change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
