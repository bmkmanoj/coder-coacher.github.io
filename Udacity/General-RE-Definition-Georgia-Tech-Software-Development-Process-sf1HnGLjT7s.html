requirements engineering which is also
called in short re is the process of
establishing the services that the
customer requires from the software
system in addition to that requirements
engineering also has to do with the
constraints under which the system
operates and is developed requirements
engineering is a very important activity
for several reasons in particular as we
also saw in earlier lessons many errors
are made in requirement specifications
so many errors are made because we don't
do requirements engineering in the right
way and many of these errors are not
being detected early but they could be
if we were to do re in the right way and
unfortunately not detecting these errors
early can dramatically increase software
costs so that's the reason why
requirements engineering is important
and why it is important to do it in the
right way the final result of the
requirements engineering process is a
software requirements specification that
we also called SRS we will discuss SRS
later in more details and also when we
talk about the projects for the course
for now it is enough to say that the
software requirements specification and
requirements engineering in general
she'll focus on what the proposed system
is intended to do and not under how it
will do it in fact how the system will
do what it is required to do is
something that we will discuss when we
talk about design of a system and later
phases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
