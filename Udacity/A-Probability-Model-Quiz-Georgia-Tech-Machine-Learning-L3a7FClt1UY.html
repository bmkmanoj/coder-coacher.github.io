distribution I'm going to define for you
Michael you'll notice that it's a
probability over our exes and it's
parameterised by theta so theta is going
to turn out to stand for a threshold
okay got it okay so here's the
probability distribution it is 1 over z
sub theta for all values of x such that
the fitness function is greater than or
equal to theta yeah and it's 0 otherwise
so do you understand that I think so so
I assumed that Z sub theta here is going
to be some kind of normalization factor
that accounts for the probability of
landing or choosing an X in that space
in the space of high-scoring individuals
above threshold that's exactly right
so another way of saying this is that
the this probability is uniform over all
values of X whose fitness are above some
threshold yeah so I'm the image I have
in my head is kind of like a mountain
range and if you put a slice through it
then everything that's kind of above
that slice
if we're gonna sample uniformly from
that that collection that's right and
everything below it we will simply
ignore doesn't happen it doesn't get
sampled from exactly ok so because you
demanded it Michael here's a quiz so two
questions in this quiz the first
question is theta is some threshold and
so let's imagine a fitness function has
to have some minimum value and some
maximum value okay and let's call those
theta sub min and theta sub max
respectively and so I want you to
describe in one or two words pea-soup
theta men of X that is the probability
distribution where the threshold is its
minimum value and pea-soup theta max of
X that is the distribution where theta
is at its maximum value you got it so
just to just to be clear sort of the
maximum meaningful and minimum
meaningful values because I can imagine
them you know if it's just sort of way
outside the range of the fitness
function then it's kind of trivial I
guess well list it is but let's assume
that theta min is the lowest value that
the fitness function can take on and
theta max is the largest value that the
fitness walks okay yeah okay that's
that's how is imagining it okay okay
yeah I'm good to go okay
so go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
