numbers for the round-trip time between
you and the Machine your pinging but
what exactly is a round-trip time it's
pretty much what it sounds like your
machine can't tell how long it takes for
a packet to get from it to the other end
but it can tell how much time has
elapsed between when it sent that packet
and when it received a response that's
the round-trip involved so there's this
famous book about a ping traveling out
from its host to a destination and going
through all these hops in the middle and
eventually coming back to where it
started taking a long round trip okay
actually this book is about a duck but
pings are kind of like ducks they
usually move in groups all in a row just
like those pings that we saw in the
terminal or just like these famous ducks
in Boston round-trip time is an
important measurement of closeness on
the network but ping time as it's often
called isn't the only measurement of
performance across a network we'll see
some other ones later in this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
