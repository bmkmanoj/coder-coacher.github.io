genetic counselor congratulations and a
new couple is come into your office
interested in knowing the genetic risk
for their child for a disease that runs
in both of their families a pretty rare
disease called von Willebrand's disease
surprisingly there's a member on each
side of the family that has type 3 which
is characterized by a loss of the von
Willebrand factor which results in blood
clot defects much like those in
haemophilia because of your solid
genetics trainings you know that the
genetically oh that causes type three
von Willebrand's disease is
characterized by an autosomal recessive
allele here's the pedigree of the
couples families the male has a father
that's affected by type three von
Willebrand's and the mother has a
maternal grandmother that's affected now
based on the information from the
following pedigree and which you know
about the genetics of type three von
Willebrand's disease in the inheritance
pattern what would you report to the
parents to the couple that's interested
in having a child as the probability
they would have an affected child I want
you to enter your response as a fraction
in this box here a fraction where you
have one number with a slash of /a
another number I'm not going to give you
possible answers on this so it's going
to make it a little difficult see how
you do and see what it's like to be a
real genetic counselor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
