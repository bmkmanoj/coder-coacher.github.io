looking at one particular region of the
ABO gene and the various alleles that we
can find there in the human population
but here's a different region of the
gene so we're much earlier in the
genetic code here we're still in the
coding region but here we're looking
from position 250 to position 270 and
what I've done is I've underlined the
genetic code were in frame here reading
our codons and the DNA sequence and you
see we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 codons to
read from so now I want us to do the
same thing that we did in one of the
previous exercises imagine you're a
ribosome and you're not reading the DNA
remember you've got to be transcribed
from DNA to RNA and then RNA is
translated by ribosomes into protein but
these are the representative coding
regions sequences these are the DNA
sequences that will eventually become
the codons which are underlined here and
let's say that we have two variations
and these times the variations are in a
change in the letter it's actually a
deletion of a letter or multiple letters
in this first variant we actually move
along and then we delete three letters
in a row and the second variation we
actually delete only one letter tell me
which one do you think will have a more
significant effect the deletion of three
letters or the deletion of only one
select one of these answers and when you
do I want you to think about why that is
and enter it into this text box here
really think about this one don't just
answer it don't just pick one I want you
to think about it have a reason for it
then select an answer and tell me why in
this text box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
