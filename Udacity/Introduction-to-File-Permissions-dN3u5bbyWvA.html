permissions on the authorized key file
and the SSH directory using a command
called chmod but what exactly does that
mean let's dive a bit deeper into how
linux manages file permissions I've
listed the contents of the students home
directory and we're going to look at
three pieces of information provided
here the first column we've looked at
briefly before remember the D means that
this is a directory the dash means that
it's a file now you might think that
there are nine additional spaces here
for information but what's actually
happening is there are three separate
sections and each of those sections has
three pieces of information let's break
out this entry here for bash Darcy the
three individual entries are RW r dash
dash and r dash dash let's go ahead and
label each of these entries this first
one on labeling owner then group and
finally everyone this means the owner
can read and write the file the dash
here indicates that the owner cannot
execute the file if they could there
would be an X here users within the
group can read this file but they cannot
write or execute it finally everyone can
read this file but they cannot write or
execute it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
