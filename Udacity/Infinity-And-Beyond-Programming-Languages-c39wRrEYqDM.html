grammar only four strings word arrival
here's our grammar from before I'm going
to add just one rule and that one adbd
rule is going to give me phenomenal
cosmic power here I've added a rule to
allow us to make compound subjects this
rule is super special awesome let me
show you a new derivation that uses this
new rule starting from sentence we go to
subject verb subject and subject verb
students and subject verb students and
subject think students and teachers
think here right here when we turn to
this subject into subject end subject
that's when we were using the star drool
and notice that now rather than a two
word sentence we've produced a four word
sentence amazing do students and
teachers think that beggars belief it's
both of us think teacher certainly don't
think let's see how this plays out this
new power that we've discussed it's
called recursion in a grammar you're
already familiar with recursion in
programming where a function calls
itself here we can replace a non
terminal subject with that same
non-terminal and some other stuff so
just as we might define factorial in
terms of factorial of X minus one we can
define subject in terms of subject and
subject this is a recursive rewrite rule
and thus the whole thing is now a
recursive grammar recursive grammars
that's where all the real power is
because in essence it allows a bit of a
loop and this gives us some room for
creativity this is how we can have a
finite structure that admits infinite
utterances but not all utterances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
