shared element transitions use the same
plumbing to power them
that is the transitions framework let's
go back to you our photo grid example
and add a shared element transition so
the selected photo transitions smoothly
between the grid and the details page
here's what it's going to look like
hopefully you agree that this is a much
smoother more continuous experience now
to build this it helps to understand a
little bit about how the system works
under the hood when we say we're doing a
shared element transition between two
activities we aren't actually sharing
any views in their hierarchy each
activity has an independent view tree
what we're doing is passing information
about the shared view such as its
position and its size between the two
when the second activity launches it
sets a transparent background and hides
all of its own views so you can so to
speak see through to the previous
activity behind it it then locates the
shared view within its own hierarchy and
alters its attributes to match those
passed in from the launching activity
and makes that single view visible it
then runs animations to transition the
shared view from this state to its
natural position in the layout as the
transition progresses the window
background and the rest of the
non-shared elements slowly fade in until
they're totally opaque so while the
views aren't technically shared this
clever trick of smoke and mirrors as it
were makes it appear that they are so
now that we understand how the process
works let's take a look at how we mark
elements as being shared and how we
control the animations of the run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
