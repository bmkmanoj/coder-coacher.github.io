is going quite fine how's it going with
you well this seems really exciting it
looks like maybe you're gonna drive the
next lesson i am going to drive the next
lesson and the next lesson is called
game theory three game theory three I
feel like that presupposes the existence
of game theories one and two we have in
fact done game theories one and two we
did it in the last class and so there's
no point in doing it all over again okay
but maybe people don't remember all of
that well I'm sure they don't because i
don't so maybe what we should do is we
should do another scooby-doo flashback
ah and we can do this in a super special
way because we're actually in the same
place at the same time yeah it's crazy
when's the last time that time yesterday
right that's true but this is the first
time we're actually recording something
like this that we are able to actually
do that in a way that it makes sense to
other people good so let's do the
scooby-doo flashback you like to do it
together sure let's do it together okay
you ready huh all right it's a gimmick
that's it ah okay you ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
