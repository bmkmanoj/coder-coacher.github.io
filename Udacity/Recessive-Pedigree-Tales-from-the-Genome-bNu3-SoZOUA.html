answers are the third the fourth and the
last answers let's take a look at why
that is just take the first statement by
itself affected individuals may carry a
dominant allele if you're affected it
means you're lactose intolerance and we
know you must be homozygous recessive or
minus minus minus minus is the recessive
condition right this is not having a
dominant allele if you have a dominant
allele you would be unaffected so that
can't be true the second statement says
affected individuals must carry a
dominant allele well know that I can't
be true either right i mean because if
they can't even have one just as a as a
conditional may we know they can't have
to have one because that would
definitely make them unaffected right
they'd be lactose tolerant now the third
statement says affected individuals must
carry a recessive allele the recessive
allele in this case is the minus and we
know that affected individuals are minus
minus and this is the only way we get an
affected individual that it is true they
must carry at least one recessive allele
because they have to have two recessive
alleles in fact so that's true the
fourth segment says unaffected
individuals must carry a dominant allele
so look at Kate's brother remember
before we didn't know what one of his
alleles were but we knew for sure that
one must be a dominant Plus allele
because he's unaffected this is
definitely true the fifth statement says
unaffected individuals must carry a
recessive allele let's go back to Kate's
brother again we don't know exactly
which allele he has but we know that he
could have either another plus allele or
minus allele but Kate's brother could in
fact be plus plus an unaffected
individual being plus plus those are two
dominant alleles so unaffected
individuals don't have to carry a
recessive allele and that leads us to
our last statement unaffected
individuals may carry your recessive
allele again we'll come back to Kate's
brother and say that he could be plus
plus or plus minus if he's plus minus
then he sure does have a recessive
allele we could also look at Kate and
her brothers parents and we see that
they're both on
affected and they do carry a recessive
allele themselves so this last statement
is in fact true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
