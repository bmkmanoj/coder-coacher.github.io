Python file to set up and configure our
database I will call this file database
setup by creating a database with SQL
alchemy has four major coding components
the configuration code which is what we
use to import all of the necessary
modules the class code that we use to
represent our data in Python the table
that represents the specific table in
our database and the mapper that
connects the columns of our table to the
class that represents it our
configuration code sets up all the
dependencies needed for my database and
binds my code to the SQL alchemy engine
for most cases this code doesn't change
much from project to project we also
have to create an instance of a class
called declarative base in order for our
class to inherit all the features of SQL
alchemy in addition we need to add some
configuration code at the end of our
Python file to connect to an existing
database or in this case create a new
one this might not make much sense right
now so let's jump into writing the
configuration code open a text editor
like sublime and follow along you may
have seen this import if you worked on a
few Python projects before the SIS
module provides a number of functions
and variables that can be used to
manipulate different parts of the Python
runtime environment next we're going to
import the column foreign key integer
and string classes from SQL alchemy
these will come in handy when we are
writing our mapper code from the SQL
alchemy txt declarative library we need
to import our declarative base which we
will use in the configuration and class
code after that we import relationship
from SQL alchemy ORM in order to create
our foreign key relationships this too
will be used when we write up our mapper
let's also import the create engine
class which we will use in our
configuration code at the end of the
file this last piece of code isn't an
import but will help us get set up when
we begin to write our class code let's
make an instance of the declarative base
class we just imported and call it base
for short the declarative base will let
SQL alchemy know that our classes are
special SQL alchemy classes that
correspond to tables in our database at
the end of our file we need to add two
more lines of code we create an instance
of our create engine class and point to
the database we will use since we are
using sequel ID 3 for this lesson the
create engine will create a new file
that we can
used similarly to a more robust database
like MySQL or Postgres the last piece we
need is based metadata create our engine
which goes into the database and adds
the classes we will soon create as new
tables in our database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
