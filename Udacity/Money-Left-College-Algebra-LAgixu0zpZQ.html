certain amount of money from the venture
capital fund errs but then he doesn't
just keep it he starts to spend it this
means that the right choice must take
both of these into account the money
that he was given initially and the
money that he spent so far the second
and last choices only have one of these
two things each so that means that
neither of them can be right so I'm
going to cross them both out so that
just leaves us with these two money from
funders plus money spent or money from
funders minus money spent spending money
actually takes away from the amount of
money that we have it doesn't add to it
so that means that the third choice
right here money from funders minus
money spent must be the right answer now
without even really trying we've
actually just done some math I know that
there aren't any numbers here but what
we've created is called an equation it's
called that because of this equal sign
right here in the middle what we're
doing with this equation is showing that
these two quantities the one on the left
side of the equal sign and the one on
the right side are equal to each other
or have the same numerical value this is
the first of many many equations that
are going to look at throughout this
course and over time you learn to do a
ton of different things with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
