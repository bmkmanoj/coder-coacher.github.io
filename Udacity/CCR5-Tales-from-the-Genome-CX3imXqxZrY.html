question is that it would be most likely
mutation in the coding region not the
non-coding region there were several
levels by which you could have addressed
the why part of the question and I've
come up with three different answers and
okay a better and a best answer to the
why question I'm gonna read these and I
want you to evaluate your own answer
against these possible answers and okay
answer would have been that the coding
region mutations change proteins okay
sure so what a better answer would have
said that coding region mutations alter
amino acid sequence and thus protein
function gives me some idea that you
understand the full impact of the
mutation but it doesn't really juxtapose
the notion of what a coding region
mutation does and why a non-coding
mutation wouldn't better describe this
so the best answer would be that a
coding region mutation is more likely to
alter amino acid sequence and thus the
function of the protein compared to a
non-coding mutation which is more likely
to affect the expression of a
functioning and intact protein go ahead
and rank your answer somewhere on the
spectrum here from okay to better to
best and you can pick check boxes in
between go ahead tell me how you think
you did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
