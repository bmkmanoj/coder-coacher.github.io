square team was worrying about it's what
most startups worry about on day one is
that well this my value prop match my
customer segment and do I have product
market fit then you tend to worry about
channels and customer relationships and
whether I can make money then you are
also are worrying about market size etc
and we kind of call this the right side
of the canvas or kind of the front stage
but the back end is equally important
and in fact in the Jersey square team
it's it's probably critical to get kind
of the partners and the activities and
the resources correct because if they
don't have Jersey suppliers or their
cleaning costs or UPS cost or correct
their expenses could be higher than
their profits and so they really needed
to the nail down partners and they
needed to understand what they needed to
be good at you know rental tracking they
needed a good rental system to be able
to figure out where the jerseys are they
needed to be experts at shipping and
dry-cleaning and marketing and customer
service and they spent a lot of time
actually thinking about what do they
have to become good at so if you take a
look at their key resources they really
needed to actually become good at a
series of things they needed to become
great at inventory management because
they didn't want a warehouse of costly
jerseys sitting around just costing them
money if they weren't moving through and
being turned they needed some type of
warehouse and logistics system and the
question they started asking even now
was is this something we should be
running out of our own garage if there's
something could we outsource is this
going to become a center of excellence
for us and a competitive advantage or is
this something that someone else could
do and all this kind of added up the
left-hand side of this canvas which is
the equivalent to revenue streams but
it's the costs well the cost of jerseys
and warehousing and shipping and
cleaning logistic tracking website
development maintenance customer service
employees etc and how does that match
revenue streams eventually the
right-hand side of the canvas down here
needs to be bigger than the left-hand
side not necessarily during the first
year but that if it's not then that
tells you how much money you need to
raise and how much cash you need before
you go cash flow
positive and so all these pieces kind of
add up to the calculus of doing a
startup</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
