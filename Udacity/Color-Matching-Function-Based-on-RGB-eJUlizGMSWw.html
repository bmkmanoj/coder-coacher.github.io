understand color in a standard way
experiments were done and they started
quite a long time ago where you would do
the following right you would you would
make some light coming into the observer
and that would be some light along that
spectrum so the red the green the blue
etc you have some pure spectral light
all right and the observers job and here
the observe is one great big eyeball
which is kind of creepy but there's
actually a person sitting there would be
to just adjust the amount of red green
and blue light and they were given a
particular type of red green and blue
particular wavelength of light and they
could put more or less of it of each of
them to try to get it to match the test
light that was being produced and most
of the spectral colors could be done
this way you could just add a certain
amount of of that light but it turned
out that some of the colors couldn't be
matched unless you actually added a
little bit of red to the original text
light okay
that is in some sense in the mixture you
had to sort of like have negative red
light and of course we couldn't make
negative red light so what you would do
is you would sort of add some positive
red light to the test thing so that's
the first thing to realize is that
certain color certain wavelengths in the
spectrum you would look at it and you
know for those particular three lights
they gave you
there was no blending of them at all
that would equal this color and the way
that gets expressed is the following
right so here you were giving a certain
type of blue green and red light and
then depending upon where you are in the
wavelength where you are in the spectrum
to paint on what single light I put out
all right you would have this is how
much red green and blue you would need
to add and you'll notice this area here
is the negative these were the colors
okay these were the spectra that for
those particular red green and blue
lights that they gave you you couldn't
make the match so they represent that as
being sort of negative red</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
