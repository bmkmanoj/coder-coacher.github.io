are exactly the same then we can modify
the PPN to MPN mapping in v m2 for the
page 2 8 6 8 which used to point to 1 0
9 6 we can now make it point to 1 2 3 b
because they both are exactly the same
content and once we have done that then
we increment the reference count to this
hash table entry 2 2 indicating that
there are 2 different virtual machines
that map to the same machine page 1 2 3
b and we're also going to remember that
these two mappings between pp and 2 8 6
8 2 1 2 3 B 4 3 f 8 2 1 2 3 B are
copy-on-write entries indicating that
they can share this page so long as
these two virtual machines are reading
it but if any one of them tries to write
it at that point for the integrity of
the system we are to make a copy of this
page and change the mappings for those
pp ends to go to different and P ends
that's the reason that we want to do
this copy-on-write and now we can free
up page number 1 0 9 6 so there is one
more page frame that's available for the
house in terms of allocation because all
of these things that I mentioned just
now a fairly labor-intensive operation
so you don't want to do this when there
is active usage of the system so
scanning the pages that is going through
all of a virtual machines pages to see
if pages that are contained in a virtual
machine may already be present in the
machine memory reflecting the contents
of some of the virtual machines that
kind of scanning you want to do it as a
background activity of the server when
it is lightly loaded looking for such
matches and mapping the virtual machines
to share the same machine page and
freeing up machine memory
for allocation by the hypervisor and the
important thing that you have to notice
is that as opposed to the earlier
mechanism that I mentioned where I said
that with the connivance off the guest
operating system the hypervisor can get
into the page table data structures
inside the guest operating systems no
such thing here it is completely done
oblivious to the guest operating systems
and therefore there is no change that
needs to be made to the guest operating
systems in order to do the sharing in an
oblivious way and this technique is
applicable to both fully virtualized as
well as the para virtualized
environments because basically all that
we are saying is that let's go through
the memory contents of a virtual machine
and see if the memory contents of that
virtual machine
any particular page frames can be shared
with other virtual machines and if so
let's do that and free up some memory
that's the idea can be applied to both
fully virtualized and para virtualized
settings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
