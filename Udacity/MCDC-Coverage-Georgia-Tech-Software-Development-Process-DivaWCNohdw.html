conditioned decision coverage also
called mc/dc this criterion is very
important because it is often required
for safety critical applications for
example the FAA the Federal Aviation
Administration requires for all the
software that runs on commercial
airplanes to be tested according to the
modified condition decision coverage so
what is the key idea behind the mc/dc
criterion it is to test only the
important combinations of conditions
instead of all of them and limit the
testing cost by excluding the other
combinations and the way in which it
works is by extending branching decision
coverage with the requirement that each
condition should affect the decision
outcome independently so let's see what
this means with an example they all
shall show you how you can reduce the
number of combinations in this way I'm
going to show you an example of how
mc/dc works using this predicate which
consists of three conditions a B and C
which are all in end
so the overall predicate is a and B and
C the first thing I'm going to do is to
show you how many test cases we will
need to satisfy the multiple condition
coverage for this simple predicate which
means how many test cases we will need
to test all the possible combinations of
true and false values for these
conditions so I'm going to populate this
table and as you can see at the end we
have a test cases each test case that's
a different combination of values for a
B and C I'm also showing for each test
case the outcome of the overall
predicate so for example if we look at
the first one the first test case will
be such that a is true B is true and C
is true and therefore the overall
outcome of the predicate is true now
let's consider the first condition a as
I said a minute ago what we want to test
that the important combination which are
the combinations in which a single
condition independently affects the
outcome of the overall predicate so if
we consider a and we look at this
possible set of these cases let's try to
find two test cases such that the only
difference between the two test cases is
the value of a and the overall outcome
of the predicate is different if we look
at the table we can see that this is
true for test cases 1 and 5 if we look
at these two test cases we can see that
the overall value of the predicate in
the two cases is true and false and that
the only difference between the value of
the conditions is in the value of a so
these two test cases satisfy exactly
what we wanted
there are two test cases in which the
value of a independently decides the
overall value of the predicate what we
do therefore is to add these first two
test cases to our set of tests down here
now let's focus on B and let's try to
find two test cases such that the value
of B is the only value that changes
between the two test cases but the
overall value of the predicate is
different the same thing that we do for
a and in this case we can see that if we
select test case number 1 in this case
number 3 we have exactly that situation
B is true in the first case Falls in the
second one a and C don't change but the
overall value of the predicate changes
and now you can notice something else
that even though we select the two test
cases to test the two values one we
already had so we only need three test
cases overall to test a and B according
to MCD C now let's look at our last
condition C at this point we know the
game so we just have to look for two
test cases that satisfy our requirements
and in this case one and two are
suitable candidates and once more
because we already have one we just have
to add two to our list so as you can see
from this example we went from having a
test cases needed to cover all the
possible combinations of conditions to
only four test cases to satisfy the
mc/dc criterion so now let's see where
mc/dc stands in our subsumption
hierarchy this is what we had so far in
the hierarchy and this is where the
mc/dc criterion will stand NC this
criterion is stronger than branch and
condition coverage why because it
requires every single condition to be
true and false and therefore it subsumes
the condition coverage criterion and it
also requires every predicate to be true
and false and therefore it substituent's
branch coverage and in addition has got
the additional requirements that the
true and false values all the conditions
have to also decide the overall value of
the predicate so it's stronger which is
more thorough than branch and condition
coverage and as usual also stronger than
branch coverage statement coverage and
condition coverage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
