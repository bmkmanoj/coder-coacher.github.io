environment is when we compare two sets
of identical twins those who were reared
apart and those who are reared together
because they're genetically identical if
genes played no role in personality then
we'd see a very small correlation or
similarity between twins who are reared
apart so different environments
likewise if environment played no role
we would see the same correlations
between twins of a race together and
those were who were raised apart
regardless of where they were raised
when researchers collected data on
personality of relatives including
identical twins they found evidence for
about 50% of the differences in
personality stemming from genetic
influence so about half of our
personality differences are due to our
genetic makeup so you would think that
the other half stems from the
environment and that's essentially true
but it's not that simple we can look at
environment in two ways one that we
share with our family and one that we do
not share with our family so friends
teachers role models and more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
