of the code of this for loop down here
so the first night we changed is the
wood density the new wood density is
going to be equal to the old wood
density minus the time step times the
burn rate since remember the burn rate
is really just the time derivative of
the wood density now for the change in
temperature of course we start with the
initial temperature and then we add to
it h times a bunch of stuff now all of
this code is just taking into account
those four factors that we were saying
influence the change in temperature so
the first thing we have right here you
can see is the 2d heat equation and this
is actually implemented using the finite
difference scheme after this we also
take into account heat loss and then the
wind and then also the combustion now
going up to the top of our wildfire
function let's talk about this initial
distribution of wood density this first
line right here is just a translation of
that mathematical expression I had
written out for you the y-intercept of
the point that we're considering is just
equal to some Y value minus the slope
that we're given times X and actually
this XY is the XY that we're talking
about at this moment that means that the
wood density then is equal to would
value 1 by a bunch of typos well that's
a problem let's fix that right now see
everyone makes mistakes this should be
wood to this should be wood one ok now
that all of that is fixed we have that
the wood density at our point XY is
equal to wood one the maximum possible
would density plus all of this this is
the difference between would too and
would one so that range in which W is
allowed to vary across the terrain
divided by the difference between
intercepts so you remember on the graph
that I showed you earlier this graph
right here actually that is the slope of
this line since would density here is on
the y axis and the intercept is actually
on the x axis if we take the difference
in wood density divided by the
difference in intercept we get the slope
of this pink line right here so now you
can see that we have the slope of that
pink line times the intercept of the
line that the point we're considering is
on minus intercept one so this is really
just using point-slope form to calculate
W remember we only want W to range
between would one and would too so this
line restricts it to that range now
let's look at the plot we get so finally
a graph of our forests in both images
were
the XY square of terrain that we've been
talking about but here were graphing the
temperature shown by these different
colors and here or graphing the density
of wood now unfortunately this is only a
50 by 50 pixel image we wanted to see
what was happening with much better
resolution we should use 200 x 200
unfortunately my computer is not
cooperating so we're going to have to
settle for this less perfect image even
though this isn't really a perfect
picture you can still tell that the wood
has been depleted in the center that I'm
sleeve wood is very low right here
compared to the rest of the area where
the fire hasn't spread yet you can also
see that as we wanted the density of the
wood does vary along lines like this in
the 200 x 200 image you would be able to
see that the wood had been very depleted
in the center and that the fire had
marched out the rim of this area we can
kind of tell that there's sort of a red
circle around here however we'd be able
to see better that the fire is moving
slower and less hot in the area where
there is less wood the spreading of the
fire is way too slow in this image and
one reason for that is that the heat is
averaged over larger pixels so actually
not letting the temperature reach the
temperature of ignition in a lot of
places I hope you found talking about
wildfires as exciting as I have awesome
job on this problem and throughout the
entire course I hope you're excited for
the final exam think it'll give you a
great look at a ton of different
examples not just from the material
you've learned about but also from some
new kinds of applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
