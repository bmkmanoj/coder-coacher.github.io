different things that functions can do
especially different ways that we can
combine them with one another let's
pretend like we have these two functions
f of X equals x cubed and G of x equals
x minus 2 we saw that we could combine
these through addition by taking F plus
G of X we could also combine these
through subtraction we could either have
F minus G of X or we could have G minus
f of X these give us two different
things or at least in this case they do
we can multiply them to give us F G of X
we also found out that we could divide
them we could find F over G of X or G
over f of X in all these situations we
just take the outputs of each function
and combine them in the way is specified
the other important concept that we
introduced in this lesson was the idea
of compositions of functions this means
using the output of one function as the
input for another function if we want F
composed with G of X that's the same as
asking for F of G of X which means that
we use the output of G as the input of F
in this case that would give us X minus
2 cubed we can switch things around and
go the other direction to looking for G
composed with F instead that means we're
looking for G of f of X which in this
case would give us X cubed minus 2 we
saw that in many cases like our
showering and getting dressed example
switching the order of composition of
functions produces a very different
outcome a very different output for the
composite function remember getting
dressed and then showering is not the
same as showering and then getting
dressed I hope you enjoyed expanding
your understanding of functions and how
they can work together great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
