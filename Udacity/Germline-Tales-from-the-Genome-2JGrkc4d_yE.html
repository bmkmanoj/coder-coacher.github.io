the physical processes that lead to
genetic variability and the physical
passing on of our genes now if you want
to have your own biological children
there's a pretty important event that
must precede the presence of children
instead of thinking of you having your
own children let's just think about you
right here I am pretty happy thirty
years old but where did I come from
about thirty years ago I was in my
mother's womb developing as an embryo
and then fetus but where did I come from
before that about nine months before I
was born I was conceived meaning that
the sex cells from my parents
the sperm fertilized the egg and I
received my very first cell with a full
genome half her mom half from dad and of
course about thirty minutes to one full
day before conception there was a pretty
important physical interaction my
biological mother and biological father
had to go through the act of sexual
intercourse for me to be here today
standing here teaching this course to
you all three of these previous events
must have happened my parents must have
found each other and exchanged sex cells
they must have had a successful
fertilization of these sex cells and I
must have had a successful development
in utero or growing in my mother's womb
now while I owe a lot to my mom and dad
for bringing me into this world I really
owe their sex cells or what we call
gametes gametes are either sperm or eggs
sperm and male eggs and females and germ
cells make gametes germ cells are the
precursors to the sex cells and in this
case the word germ doesn't mean germ
like bacteria it means germ like
germination like a flower the cells that
make our gametes are called germ cells
because they are the seeds for our
germination so understanding how germ
cells make gametes is a really critical
component to understanding which alleles
you're gonna get from which parent let's
talk a little bit more about how that
process of cell division is going to
occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
