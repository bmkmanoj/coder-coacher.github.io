first I have to find three hands SF
stands for a straight flush f K stands
for four of a kind and F H stands for
full house and I've defined those by
taking this string splitting the string
up on the spaces and so that will give
me a list of five cards for each of
these three possible hands and then I've
asserted that when we play a game of
poker between these three hands that the
winning hand is the straight flush and
the whole idea of having tests like this
is a vital part of software development
it's important that each part of the
specification gets turned into a piece
of code that implements it and a test
that tests it so here we have only one
test this is a test that tests part of
the implementation of the poker function
if you don't have tests like these then
you don't know when you're done and you
won't know if you've done it right and
you won't have confidence that any
future changes might not be breaking
something so remember to be a good
programmer you must be a good tester
right you test cases and test them often
now I want you to add two more tests one
test that will test whether the winner
between four of a kind and full house is
correct and so what should that be
should be four of a kind and another
test that seems a little bit more
trivial but testing if we have two
copies of full house playing each other
that full house indeed is the winner out
of those two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
