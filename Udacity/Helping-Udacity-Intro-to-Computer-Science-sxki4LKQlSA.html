asks this might be a string strange
question but I will ask it anyway what
do you guys expect from us I love the
idea of Udacity and I'm sure I'm not the
only one how can we help you dicey grow
be successful well so that's not a
strange question at all we love the
question um we love that students are
helping out making the course grow the
things that that I've been seeing a lot
of and I hope people will continue to
definitely trying to encourage your
friends to take a class we still have
time to enroll more students in the
class and it's great to have as many
students as possible
there's also a lot that you're
contributing by posting in the forums by
either answering questions or asking
questions and that will enhance the
quality of class for everyone and also
if you can produce creative extra
materials we've seen some examples of
that already that's something that will
definitely enhance the class for
everyone and will certainly appreciate
any efforts to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
