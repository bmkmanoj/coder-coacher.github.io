component and this refers to the ways in
which I behave towards the Redwings
well obviously I buy a lot of Red Wings
material if the Red Wings are on TV I'll
watch a game if I don't have access to a
TV I'll listen to him on the radio
when the Red Wings come to town I'll buy
a ticket and go see him and this year I
even went to the hotel where they stayed
so I could try to meet some of my Red
Wings obviously I have a strong
behavioral component in my attitude
towards the Red Wings and the third
component is the cognitive component and
this refers to the rational thoughts and
beliefs that make up my attitude towards
the Red Wings so here I know things such
as how many Stanley Cup championships we
won eleven when we first started the
league 1926 I know the famous rubbing
players such as Gordie Howe Ted Lindsey
Steve Yzerman Brendan Shanahan Nick
Lidstrom I know all the players names
and numbers I know the rules of the game
I know the coaches and I even know the
hometown announcers all those are the
cognitive components of my attitude
towards the Red Wings let's go back and
finish up this part on attitudes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
