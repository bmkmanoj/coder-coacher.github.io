just explicitly talk about parameters in
machine learning parameters are
arguments that you pass when you create
your classifier so this is before
fitting and they can make a huge
difference in the decision boundary that
your algorithm arrives at so what are
some of the parameters for an SVM well
we've talked about one already which is
the kernel and there are two more that
we're going to talk about right now
which are C and gamma and that was the
difference between these two s VMs that
I showed you just a minute ago is they
had different kernels so the one on the
left was a linear kernel and the one on
the right was an RBF kernel and as it
happened I was also monkeying around
with gamma here if you don't monkey
around with gamma they'll actually look
much more similar than this so the gamma
in this case happened to be a thousand
so here's a quiz for you a reason for
you to try some stuff on your own which
of the following s VMs do you get when
you use the parameters kernel is a
linear kernel and the gamma is set to
1.0 so remember before it was 1,000 so
now we're bringing down on gamma by
three orders of magnitude let me give
you a few options which one do you think
is the linear kernel with a gamma of 1.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
