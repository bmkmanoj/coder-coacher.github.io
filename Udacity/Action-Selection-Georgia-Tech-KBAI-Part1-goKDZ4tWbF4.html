Atlanta Braves is the pitcher and Martin
pride of Madison our Diamondbacks is the
depart Kris Medlen has a goal of
finishing the inning without allowing
any runs
how does Kris Medlen decide on an action
we may conceptualize Medlin's
decision-making like the following
madeleine may look at various choices
that are available to him he may throw a
pitch or he may choose to walk the
batter if he walks the batter then there
additional possibilities that open up
he'll need to face in next batter
if it uses to pitch then he'll likely
decide what kind of ball to throw a
slider a fastball or a curveball if it
was a slider then there is a next set of
possibilities open up there might be a
strike or a ball or head or he may just
strike the batter out
thus medellin is setting up a
state-space now what we just stated
informally can be stated formally so we
can imagine a number of states in the
state space the state space is a
combination of all these states that can
be achieved by applying various
combinations of operators starting from
the initial state each state can be
described in terms of some features f1
f2 there could be more each feature can
take on some values for example we won
there might be a range of values here so
initially the pitcher is at state s0 and
the pitcher wants to achieve some state
s 101 and interstate as 101 presumably
the pitchers goal has been accomplished
so we may think of the pitchers
decision-making as some kind of apart
from its current state to this
particular goal state this is an
abstract space the pitcher has not yet
made any action the pitcher is to
thinking the pitcher is setting up an
abstract state space in his mind and
exploring that state space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
