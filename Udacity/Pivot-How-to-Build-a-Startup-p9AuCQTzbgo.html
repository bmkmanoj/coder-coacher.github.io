observations about customer development
is this notion of the pivot pivot was a
term that my best student ever Eric Ries
coined when he noticed the arrow between
customer and validation and customer
discovery and he actually gave it a name
which i think is incredibly accurate a
pivot says what do you do when your
hypotheses don't meet reality and this
is such a neat observation about
startups and why what we now know is
much different than before what we now
know instead of firing executives when
our business model doesn't match what's
going on outside in the real world we
fire the model and we simply say hey our
hypotheses were wrong so because we've
been building the product iterative ly
and incrementally and keeping our burn
rate incredibly low a pivot is the
substantive change to one or more the
business model components it just simply
says hey this isn't our customer segment
our customer segment is really here or
blame it our revenue model shouldn't be
freemium we should be charging for it
from day one or we've been using the
wrong distribution channel we need a
direct sales force or the G we have the
wrong partners by the way an iteration
is a minor change to one or more of the
business model components so for example
an iteration would be going from
charging from you know $9.99 to you know
$6.99 a pivot would be a change of G our
pricing is going from freemium to
subscription that's a substantive change
so the key idea here is a pivot allows
you to get out and make changes remember
typically only the founders could do
pivots but is actually the heart of what
makes customer development radically
different than what's come before the
other thing to notice about pivots is
that you want to keep them up at a
constant speed and a constant tempo and
you want your entire company operating
with speed and tempo and decision-making
just like a metronome it's constant it's
consistent and it's relentless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
