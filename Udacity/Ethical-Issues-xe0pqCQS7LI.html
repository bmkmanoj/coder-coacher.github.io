that covers law ethics and privacy so
we're not talking about any of these in
great detail and you said I only talked
about two off the laws didn't even get
to privacy but we do want to very
briefly talk about sort of ethics
related to our online activities so
what's the difference between laws and
ethics we know that ethics have to do
with sort of you know an individual's
sense of what is right and wrong on the
other hand laws are so societal you know
we as a society decide state local or
federal whatever it is laws that you
know say what is wrong if you did that
you would have certain kind of sanctions
laws may not cover certain things but
your sense of right and wrong might say
well I should not be doing this and
we're talking about that in the context
of you know what we do online or what we
do in cyberspace before we sort of go
further it's worthwhile pointing out
that when it comes to your ethical sort
of your sense of right and wrong of
course there is no one no external
arbiter or enforcement agency like law
where we have the police and the courts
and things like that so so what's sort
of the example of an ethical code that
that you you can think about so what
happens you discover a vulnerability in
in a commercial product that's used by
lots and lots of people what is ethical
disclosure of this vulnerability so here
is the idea and the dilemma so if you
disclose it it's disclosed to even the
bad guys the bad guys can then exploit
it and then can go and attack the system
in which you have discovered a
vulnerability okay so that says maybe
you know disclosing it is not a great
thing the other way to think about this
is that if you don't disclose it that
doesn't mean the
guys actually won't find out about it
and if you don't disclose it then there
is no pressure on the vendor who
actually produced this commercial system
or product to actually do something
about it okay so by disclosing you sort
of fixing this problem or well then
really we have hopefully in a timely
fashion and but at the same time you're
also making this information available
to bad guys so that's where you know
where do you draw the line what's the
ethical thing to do here so of course we
have our personal notion of right and
wrong so it could be sort of your
personal thing or it could be you know
ethical conduct defined by some
professional society that you may be a
member of so ACM or I Triple E or even
Georgia Tech so ethical standards are
you know code of conduct doing the right
thing knowing what's right and what is
wrong of course
laws and ethics go together to help us
understand now what is that we can do
without doing anything illegal or doing
anything wrong
versus and what it is that should not be
done because that's the wrong thing to
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
