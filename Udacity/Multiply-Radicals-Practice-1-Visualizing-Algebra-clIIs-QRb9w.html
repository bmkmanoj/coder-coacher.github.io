squared and for our second problem we'll
have nine plus three times the square
root of six nice thinking for getting
those to correct for the first problem
we just want to multiply the radicands
together so we'll have four times 16
which equals 64 and x squared times x
squared which equals x to the fourth the
square root of sixty-four is 8 and the
square root of x to the fourth is x
squared we want to make sure that we
multiply these factors that come out by
3 so we'll have 24 x squared for a final
result for the second problem we
distribute or multiply 3 root 3 times
each of these terms here we'll multiply
root 3 times root 3 to get 3 we still
have a 3 in front of these two radicals
so we'll have 3 times 3 which equals 9
then for the second term will have 3
root 3 times root 2 we just multiply
these two radicals together to get 3
root 6 there is a one in front of the
square root of 2 which is what we
multiply the 3 x 3 x 1 equals 3 + 3 x 2
is equal to 6 this one's underneath the
route we can't combine the nine and the
three root 6 since nine doesn't have a
square root of six on the end these
aren't like terms so this is our final
result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
