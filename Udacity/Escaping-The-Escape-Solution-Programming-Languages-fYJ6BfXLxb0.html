regular expression starts with our
single quote or our double quote I'm
going to use the single quotes this time
so that I won't have to escape quite as
many of these then we want to match the
blue double quote here at the beginning
and somewhere way at the end we'll want
to match the closing one and that'll be
the end of our regular expression so now
we just have to think of what goes in
here in the middle and this may not be
enough room I may have to erase it and
write it again well whatever it is it's
going to be zero or more of something
and as we're going across the string
there's sort of backslashes which are
important and everything else which is
not so important so if there's any
character that's not a backslash in here
I'm escaping the backslash we can just
read right over it that's no problem
inside our string or you could actually
have an escape sequence like this
backslash close quote that looks like a
literal backslash followed by anything
and then it's done so let me just
diagram this little more say this
opening quote is one that matches things
like this opening quote in the string
then in here we have anything that's not
a backslash that's too that's I space se
SI y comma but then eventually we do get
to a backslash over here we have a two
character sequence that's a backslash
followed by a dot these two characters
the backslash followed by the quote they
are three and then we're back to
matching tues h-e-l-l-o dot and now we
have another backslash in a quote so
these two together will be another three
and then this part at the end is number
four so I have zero or more copies of my
string body the elements of my string
body are either normal characters or two
character escape sequences and although
this looks like three characters it's
really just too I have to escape the
backslash as a minor aside after the
Beatles and sound of music examples from
above you may not be surprised to know
that a number of English songs have
enduring popularity abc123 be NGO seem
to have a regular expression sort of
feel repetition is very
in songs and you get the same thing out
of it that you get out of a regular
expression a concise notation verses and
choruses but then when you expand it out
it takes a long time to sing however
there is one song that is actually too
complicated for regular expressions the
dreaded 99 bottles of beer on the wall
if you actually want the counting to
work out correctly 99 298 297 we can't
fit it in a regular expression framework
huh we'll have to return to that later
and eventually we will be smart enough
to sing this song for more info on this
Don Knuth the computer scientist has
written an essay on the complexity of
songs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
