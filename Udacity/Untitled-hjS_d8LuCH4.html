in the next segment we'll execute it
we'll need to make our first request to
see how many results we get then parse
the JSON that it returns then determine
how many pages of results that ends up
being we can then generate a random
number in that range then use that
number to make a second request for a
random page and finally repeat what we
did previously and get a random photo
from that random page of results in this
chart the steps are defined in a way
that suggests that each step happens one
after the other without delay but
remember when we're working with
networking requests the request don't
complete immediately that's why we use
the completion handler to define what we
want to happen once a network request
finishes it's like saying I don't know
when the request will complete but run
this code when it does another added
benefit is that while the network
request is being processed our app can
continue running we describe this kind
of request as an asynchronous request or
asynchronous task because it gives us
the ability to define the behavior you
want and to defer its execution until
after something happens in this case
after the request completes you can
think of an asynchronous requests like
putting a cake in an oven and setting a
timer to indicate when the cake will
finish baking while the cake is baking
we can go do other things like make
frosting but as soon as the timer goes
off we need to pull the cake out of the
oven pulling the cake out of the oven is
like our completion handler it's what we
do as soon as the timer goes off in the
same way we want to make the second
request only after the first request
finishes and we've gotten our random
page number in the second request will
define another completion handler to
handle getting a random photo from the
random page of results so you can see
how to achieve this flow of steps we are
chaining together asynchronous requests
when one request finishes we'll move on
to the next and so forth this kind of
chaining of asynchronous network tasks
is a common occurrence and there are
some popular frameworks out there for
dealing with this we won't go into
detail about them in this course though
but if you're curious you should check
