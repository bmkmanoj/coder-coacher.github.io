evenly across the collection view you'll
want to set the size of the custom meme
cells and the spacing between them to
accomplish this we use the class UI
collection view flow layout here I've
opened the class reference and you can
also find a link to it in the
instructors notes I encourage you to
take some time to read through it
carefully the UI collection view flow
layout class has three properties that
we'll need for laying out our sent memes
minimum line spacing minimum interitum
spacing and item size to implement a UI
collection view flow layout first add a
flow layout object to your collection
view controller using this line of code
open up the assistant editor so that you
can see this storyboard file and then
connect to the flow layout outlet to its
representation in storyboard you can see
here that it's marked with a little
yellow box next set the spacing between
items by setting the minimum interitum
spacing property like this you can see
that the variable space is being set to
three similarly use the minimum line
spacing property to set the spacing
between rows naturally you don't need to
use three use whatever spacing you think
looks best last but not least set the
item size the item size is the size of
your cells and I encourage you to set
the item size to be dependent upon the
size of the main view which is dependent
upon screen size that way your layout
will work for multiple screen sizes to
access the size of the main view you can
use this self dot view dot frame dot
size here I'm accessing the width
property and you can do the same for
height so let's see how our layout looks
okay so apart from this one image the
layout and portrait looks pretty good
let's see what it looks like in
landscape in landscape you can see that
we've got a little extra space between
items and I'm going to leave it up to
you to figure out why that is and get
this layout looking the way you want it
I'll give you a hint
one solution involves accessing the
height of the main view kind of like the
way we access to the width here and that
ought to give you a good start on
collection view flow layouts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
