words representation let's get your
hands on the keyboard and have you using
it in SK learn an SK learn bag of words
is called count vectorizer presumably
because it's counting the number of
times various words show up in a corpus
now I'm going to walk you through some
examples on the interpreter and in the
next few videos you'll get some hands-on
experience via programming quizzes I
head over to the interpreter and using
the online documentation for reference I
import the count vectorizer
count vectorizer lives in the feature
extraction dot txt part of SK learned
she got wrong the first time but I can
import it just like any other object in
SK learn then I create my vectorizer and
I need to feed it some documents that
come in the form of strings
I liked Sebastian's example but I think
I want to do something that sounds a
little bit more like the emails that I
would actually expect to see in an inbox
so I'll make up some strings these
aren't really emails but they kind of
sound like them the first thing I need
to do to get these into count vectorizer
is I need to put them into a list now
I'm going to create the bag of words
which is what I get when I put this
email list into my count vectorizer and
I actually did this a little bit wrong
there's two steps that I forgot here the
first is that I need to fit my data
using my vectorizer
the next thing is I need to transform it
so first I'll do the fit this is where
it's actually figuring out what all the
words in the corpus are all the words in
all the emails and assigning say numbers
are list indices to each of them and
then the transform is where it actually
takes all the words in the corpus and
figures out how many counts of each word
occur my syntax isn't perfect here but
this should work and now to start to
understand this let me print my bag of
words see what it looks like what I get
is a bunch of tuples and integers and
while this looks rather opaque we can
actually unpack it in a fairly
straightforward way let's take this row
as an example the way to interpret this
is that in document number one word
number seven occurs one time now of
course we have to ask what word number
seven is in order to interpret this as
humans but
all of the information is there
similarly I can see in document number
one where number six
occurs three times so just out of
curiosity let's go back up to document
number one and figure out what we think
word number six is so document number
one is going to be string two because
the indexing starts at zero and I can
see that there is actually a word that's
repeated three times and it's the word
great so assuming that that's what word
number seven is things are starting to
make sense from looking at the SK learn
documentation I see that there's an
attribute of the bag of words called the
vocabulary and this is a way that I can
test my hypothesis so I call the
function get on my vocabulary and I pass
to it an argument which is the word and
my hypothesis is that what it should
return because this line gave us the
clue that word number six and document
one occurred three times and that's what
happens so this way for any word in the
corpus I can figure out what feature
number it is in my bag of words you can
also go the other direction too if you
wanted to ask for example what is the
word associated with feature number six
there's a way you can extract this
information too
we'll get to that in the next lesson on
feature selection in a really cool
example but now I want to get your hands
on the keyboard with a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
