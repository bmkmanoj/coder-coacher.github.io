to explain how ad networks work this
isn't strictly relative or relevant to
this class but it's kind of a neat
example of how cookies are used so say
you have your browser and it makes a
request to some website and you know
this website responds with some HTML you
know one of the things in this in this
HTML could actually be a little one
pixel hidden image that you don't even
see that makes a request to somebody
else
for example google.com and this in fact
happens and because Google comm has an
analytics package that a lot of websites
use to track you know traffic and what
users are doing and that sort of thing
and google.com may respond you know
it'll respond with the actual pixel
image you know this might be in you know
image source equals you know Google
something and this may have a cookie on
there that will you know assign you some
ID so that when you come back to the
website again and we you across this
pixel again Google can track that you
are the same user coming back and you
know that you know that's how they know
whether you're a new user or a returning
user and and so this is you know this is
an example of a third-party cookie you
know we went to Udacity comm in our
browser but we received a cookie for
google.com you know Udacity doesn't
receive those cookies but Google will
and that's how they run their analytics
and and there are legitimate uses for
this you know analytics is a really good
example we you know we use Google
Analytics on you know we use it on
reddit and we use it currently on
Hipmunk and Udacity uses Google
Analytics as well so we can see you know
what our traffic is what people are
clicking on that sort of thing there's
also more sinister uses which is actions
Google is a big user of this now Google
knows something about you you know they
know that you've been to this Web site
and you may go to another web site you
know let's say it's it's pets comm and
pets comm you know returns HTML you know
as usual and it has the same pixel which
goes to google.com
all of a sudden Google knows hey you've
been to Udacity comm and pets comm
because they're like a common third
party here and Google actually has you
know between Google Analytics and
Adsense and that sort of thing they
actually have pixels and
since on a huge percentage of webpages
you know they have this one of the
largest ad networks and so now they know
this information and they can they can
give you ads that are more relevant to
you which is sometimes you know you can
argue that both ways you can say oh that
ads more relevant to me you know so I'm
more likely to click on it maybe that's
a good thing or it's creepy that this
company knows all these different
websites I've been to now generally we
can trust Google but you can't say the
same for all all ad networks so anyway
that's kind of how they work they've got
these little tracking pixels and when
you disable third-party cookies in your
browser you help disconnect yourself a
little bit from from that sort of
tracking and you know I don't mean to
pick on Google specifically because you
know they're actually you know not to
Shady but there are a lot of shady
variations of this out there so that's
how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
