installing xcode so if you haven't yet
pause this video and take a moment to
finish the installation since i already
have xcode installed i'm ready to launch
the maze application to launch the app
we need to first launch xcode and you
can do this by clicking on the spotlight
icon in the top right hand corner of the
screen or optionally you can hit command
+ in space and that will bring up the
same spotlight search and then type
xcode this will bring up the xcode
launch screen from the launch screen you
can create new Xcode projects open
existing projects or create a playground
we won't quite be using playgrounds yet
but they're a great tool for
experimenting and writing swift code for
now you want to open an existing Xcode
project the maze project to be precise
we've created the maze project ahead of
time for you so if you haven't
downloaded it already go ahead and
download it first before continuing
ahead once you've downloaded the project
and saved it somewhere on your computer
select open another project and then
you'll want to navigate to the project
so I've saved it on my desktop and you
want to open up the Xcode project file
and we'll give it a second to load and
here we go this is Xcode it's a huge
application so we'll start taking it one
piece at a time to run the maze
application click on the play button in
the upper left hand corner of the Xcode
interface you may also hear this button
referred to as the Run button this will
launch the iOS simulator with the maze
app and there we go congratulations
you've launched your first app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
