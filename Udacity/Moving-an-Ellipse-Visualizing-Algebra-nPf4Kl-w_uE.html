lips we first encountered at the studded
lesson we knew that this ellipse was
centered at the origin 0 0 and that we
move two units left and right to get a
point and three units up and down from
the center to get two more points but
not every ellipse is going to be
centered at the origin sometimes they
can be elsewhere just like we could
shift circles we can also shift ellipses
so if I wanted to graph this one I would
notice that the graph would shift up one
whole unit remember when we replace y
with y minus a number the graph really
shifts up that many units and instead of
just shifting up one unit I could also
shift it up two units we could ship it
up three units four units or even five
units the key thing to remember is that
this sign is the opposite of the
direction the ellipse moves so now let's
say if we were looking at our original
lips and we want to move it down instead
of subtracting from Y will add to Y so
if we add 1 to y will get a shift
downward our entire orange your lips
moved down one unit and we get this new
blue ellipse and I can continue shifting
it further down by adding the larger
number like 2 or 3 or 4 and so on so we
know adding or subtracting 2 y makes a
graph or an ellipse move up or down so
to move a graph left or right we'll have
to add or subtract 2x so again notice
that I have my original graph and this
time i'm going to subtract one from X if
i subtract one from x i'll get this
graph notice that all the points on our
lips shifted one unit to the right
here's just a few of the points that you
can see that all shifted one unit to the
right and if we wanted to we could have
two units to the right three units to
the right or even four and again notice
that this is a subtraction sign so if
it's a negative here we're really moving
to the right but if it's a positive here
we're really moving to the left so this
new equation would be our original
orange lip
just shifted one unit to the left and
notice that we have plus 1 a plus one
really shifted it to the left so plus
two was shifted to two to the left and
plus three was shifted three units to
the left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
