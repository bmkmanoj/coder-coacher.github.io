the rest of them are we learned that a
polynomial is an expression that only
uses addition subtraction and
multiplication to combine constants of
variables but this first choice right
here has a big division sign in it
dividing one expression by another
expression now if we had either the
numerator or the denominator of this
fraction on its own then both of them
would be polynomials but because they're
divided this is not a polynomial so
we'll check that one off well talk more
about expressions that look like this
later on in the course one of our other
important rules is that a polynomial
must have exponents in it that are only
non negative integers right here we have
X to the one-half and one-half may be
positive but it's not an integer so that
means that this is not a polynomial we
can think about that rule again we look
at this answer choice right here
negative six x to the fifth plus X to
the negative third minus 11x plus nine
all of these terms in here are fine for
being part of polynomials except for
this one X to the negative third because
negative 3 is a negative integer
exponent not a non-negative integer
exponent so that means this expression
is not a polynomial it may seem a little
bit funny that six counts as a
polynomial we don't often talk about
numbers of variables on their own as
polynomials but they technically do
qualify since they do fit our definition
we said that polynomials could have just
variables just constants or both so six
and all other constant terms are
technically polynomials we're going to
talk about polynomials throughout the
entire rest of the course so it's great
to get a handle on how to define them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
