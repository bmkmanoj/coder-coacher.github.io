motion the the geometry of the points
for example let's suppose that I'm on
some plain all my points are on a plane
here's my equation i'm playing so all my
points XY and z satisfy this remember we
showed this before when we were mapping
everything on a plane and saying how it
would have moved we ended up with a 3 by
3 matrix but it was a homogeneous system
so we could scale it anyway we wanted so
if we wanted to we could set one of
those elements to a 1 and then we only
have to solve for the other eight there
were eight unknown so therefore we
needed how many points Megan how many
points how many points4 points here is
the the equation using just the XY
values and you'll see a one two three
four five six seven eight 8.88 unknowns
four points needed so when it's on a
plane now if it plane is very very far
away what does that mean well what it
means is if the difference in the
distance on the plane is small compared
to the distance from the plane to the
camera you can show that this is the
simplified model right it's just six
unknowns otherwise known as an affine
transform this is one of the reasons
that a fine transforms are used so much
when things are on a plane on a wall on
the floor even on maybe the front of a
body for a while mine used to be more
plainer than it is now for small amounts
of motion you can think of this being as
a plane that's relatively far away and
what that means is that this that that
plane will undergo an affine
transformation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
