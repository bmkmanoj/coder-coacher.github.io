we're gonna learn something insanely
cool you might remember from the very
beginning of this class that we had
datasets that involve more than one
dimension for example the size of a
house relative to its price and
initially we talked about scatter plots
we talked about bar charts but we didn't
talk about what's the holy grail of
statistics and that is fitting a line to
the data points after this unit you'll
be able to fit a line to data points
like those and you'll even be able to
tell me what the residual error is in
that fit and that allows us not just to
understand the data but also to make
predictions about points we've never
seen before so let's dive straight in
let's talk about lines let's talk about
the technology to fit lines to data
called linear regression if I have
two-dimensional data such as the age of
a person and the person's income and
this is obviously made-up data then
linear regression tries to fit a line
that best describes the data so how do
we specify a line suppose we call the
horizontal axis X X and suppose we call
the vertical axis Y then a line is
commonly described by a functional
relationship between x and y of the
following form y equals B times X plus a
so let's look at lines let's take a
simple example y equals 2x let's add
units to the axis of the coordinate
system and let me draw three different
examples of lines a blue line a green
line and the red line and for this
example y equals 2x
can you imagine which of the three lines
would be described by this equation
please check one of these three boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
