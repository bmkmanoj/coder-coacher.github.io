phase has moved to the second phase of
ru P which is the elaboration phase and
there are four main goals and activities
for the elaboration phase analyzing the
prominent domain to gather better
understanding of the domain establishing
a solid architectural foundation for the
project eliminating the highest risk
elements which basically means
addressing the most critical use cases
and finally refine the plan of
activities and estimates of resources to
complete the project the outcome of the
elaboration phase reflects these
activities and also in this case
produces several artifacts the first one
is an almost complete use case model
with all use cases and actors identified
and most use case descriptions developed
as part of this phase we also identify a
set of what we call supplementary
requirements so these are basically all
the requirements that are not associated
with the use case and this set includes
in particular or non-functional
requirements such as security
reliability maintainability and so on so
all the ones that are relevant for the
system that you're developing we
mentioned before that the software
architecture is developed in an
incremental way so it's not created at
once and this is exactly what happens in
the elaboration phase that we take the
initial architecture that was defined in
the inception phase and we refine it
until we get to a software architecture
which is complete and that is part of
the deliverables for this phase and the
list continues so let me make some room
in addition to producing a complete
architecture for our system in the
elaboration phase we also define the
lower level design for the system and
therefore as part of this phasor we
produce as deliverables a design model
and together with that a complete set of
test cases and an executable prototype
we also produce a revised project plan
now that we have more information about
the project we can refine the various
estimates and the various pieces of
information in the project plan and also
an updated risk assessment document
finally in this phase we also generate a
preliminary user manual that describes
to the users how the system can be used
and should be used so now let's see what
are the evaluation criteria for the
elaboration phase which is our second
milestone so I'm just going to list them
here the first one is whether the vision
and the architecture are stable or
they're still changing
so did we converge
into a final complete vision for the
system thus the prototype show that the
major risks that we have identified have
been resolved or at least addressed in
this phase is the project plans
sufficiently detailed and accurate do
all stakeholders agree that the vision
can be achieved that with the current
plan is the actual resource expenditure
versus the planned expenditure
acceptable so now we started consuming
resources and therefore we can check
whether our estimates were correct and
also in this case the project might be
cancelled or considerably reshaped if it
fails to pass this milestone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
