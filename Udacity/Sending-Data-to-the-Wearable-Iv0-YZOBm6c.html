designing your application architecture
is that your phone typically has a much
more powerful processor and a much
larger battery than your wearable you
want to offload as much as possible away
from the wearable to try to get the most
battery life out of it another key part
of the application architecture is that
the phone has direct access to the
Internet while the wearable over here
does not so let's imagine a scenario
where you're building an app to show
weather updates on a wearable the phone
will need to make the request to fetch
the data and then send that to the
wearable via the data layer API there
are many ways that you can implement
this but if you do not design as
carefully it may perform poorly so how
do we implement an efficient solution to
this one of the first improvements comes
from changing how you wake up the
wearable device rather than having the
wearable wake up every 10 seconds or so
and request an update of information
from the phone instead allow the phone
to drive updates to the wearable device
the simple action of keeping the watch
asleep as long as possible will help
conserve battery life so once you've
made the weather update request from the
phone to the Internet you make it back
updated information an important step to
do here is to compare this with the
previous information downloaded earlier
if there's no change the information you
should not update the watch there's no
point waking it up just to tell it that
nothing has changed we want the watch
sleeping as much as possible if you have
detected a change it's important to
minimize the amount of data we actually
send to the wearable it would be a bad
idea to send the entire weather query
result to the wearable since it probably
includes a lot of extra information such
as what you see here instead we should
pass it on the phone and send just a
single temperature value like this one
here to the wearable remember we're
trying to minimize the amount of work
done on the wearable and even things
which might seem trivial will add up
eventually so how should we send out to
the wearable if you had to send a large
amount of temperature data for a time
range it might be tempting to create
separate data items for each time and
temperature and send them separately
however for each piece of data sent
between the phone and the wearable there
are overheads added by the platform and
the network these overheads include
headers for packets acknowledgments per
packet and energy required for every
packet sent as well as activating the
wireless hardware when designing code to
send data over a network
taking these overheads in a
consideration is important so by storing
many numeric values into a single
message there will be much less data
sent and processed than sending each one
separately the results can be quite
considerable as you can see here once
you have sent the data item to the
wearable you might be tempted to add an
acknowledgement to check it was received
however if you're using data items they
are guaranteed by the framework to be
synchronized when the wearable is paired
up so you can be sure they will
eventually be received if we're using
messages then you will need to check
that they were received since
transmission is never guaranteed if the
device is disconnected or something else
happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
