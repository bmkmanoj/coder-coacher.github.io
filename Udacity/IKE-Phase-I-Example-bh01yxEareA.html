have appreciate secret key and they use
TV Hellman to establish a new shared key
and they used the pressure key to
authenticate this newly established
share key
here's how it works first the initiator
sends to the responder the crypto that
it proposes to use along with the cookie
the cookie can be easily computed by the
initiator and can be easily verified but
responder for example this cookie can be
computed as a hash over the initiators
IP address and the current timestamp
together the cookie is used to prove
that the initiator has done some
computation is serious about following
through the protocol in general cookies
are used to mitigate denounce service
attacks where an initiator can send a
lot of requests to a responder and know
all it'll cost the responder then sends
back its choice of crypto algorithms and
its own cookie to the initiator second
here why I and why are are the public
components of the DV Hellman key
exchange and n I and n are are the nonce
values of the initiator and the
responder third both the initiator and
responder compute the same shear key
according to TV Hellman key exchange and
other keys for the I guess a fourth they
then exchange hash values to
authenticate the newly established key
using the appreciate secret key the hash
is computed using the information that
they have just exchanged along with the
pre shared key we will explain this
shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
