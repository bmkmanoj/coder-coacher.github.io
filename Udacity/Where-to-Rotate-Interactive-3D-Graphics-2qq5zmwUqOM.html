statues standing on a platform that's
some distance from the origin you'd like
to rotate it in place on its base so
that it's facing like this you know that
if you just try to rotate it it's going
to rotate around the origin and it'll
swing wildly in position you want it to
stay where it is you have a few matrices
at hand to perform the task you're given
a translation matrix that would move the
center of the models base to the origin
you also have a rotation matrix that
will rotate the model or anything else
around the y axis finally you can also
invert the translation and rotation
matrices the question is what series of
transforms will rotate the model on its
base in other words we want to end up
with the object in the same position but
rotated around its own axis but the
transforms in the usual right-to-left
order rightmost being applied to the
object first if you don't need all four
slots for matrices just leave the
leftmost ones empty for example if you
needed just a single transform put it in
this rightmost slot to solve this one
you might want to remember the rule once
a transform is applied forget about it
and just think about where the model
itself is then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
