do is I had to build up a list called
submissions that's going to hold the
links that are submitted by this authors
so the first thing I do is I ate over
the list links for ll and links and if
the submitter ID matches our constraint
6 2 4 4 3 I add it to our list of
submissions here and then I said sorted
by time ascending so then I need to call
sort on this on this list here and if
you haven't used the sort function it's
pretty handy so you can just call sort
and that'll sort by whatever the Python
default would be so if it's integers it
sorts by integers but these aren't an
interest these are you know entire
linked objects so Python would probably
sort of LexA graphically based on how it
prints out I think so we want to sort on
submit a time so that's what the key
parameters for and then I return to
submissions and so if I run my query you
can see the output down here and you can
see we have three links it's not the
easiest thing to read here is link
number one and submission time is 1 3 3
3 9 0 and we can see our next link is
here and we can see the submission time
is 1 3 3 3 9 3 so bigger good and
finally down here we can see our last
link and it's submission time is 1 3 3 4
ok so they're sorted by submission time
I'm gonna see they all have submitter ID
6 2 4 4 3 here and here okay so that was
not too hard but it's still a little
tedious and this is the type of thing
these types of problems the database can
help with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
