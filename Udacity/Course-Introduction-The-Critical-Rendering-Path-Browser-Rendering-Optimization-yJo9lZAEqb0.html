advocate at Google and I'm Cameron
Pittman I make front-end web development
courses here at Udacity we're here to
help you develop apps that run at a
silky smooth 60 frames per second and
you may think it's just JavaScript that
you need to worry about but there's
actually a lot more to it than that this
course is about changing the way that
you approach performance issues we're
going to help you look at the bigger
picture okay let's play a game this was
made by my colleague Jake Archibald and
it's designed to show off problems with
framerate and performance on the web see
these ships at the top they move
smoothly and the ones at the bottom
Jutta the game is super simple
shoot the jittering ships as quickly as
you can by clicking on them you're gonna
have to spot them amongst the smooth
ones okay I'm gonna shoot the juddering
the juddering ships that's a hard weird
British word I don't think it's an
amazing British whoo I think you made it
just in English which means I can't be
wrong you know that's that's not true
okay you know you're not doing well
that's not great Oh
anyways I hit the wrong one but I hope
you can do a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
