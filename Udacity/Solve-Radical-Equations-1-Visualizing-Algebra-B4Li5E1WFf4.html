makes this equation true and it's
positive 12 great algebra skills for
getting this one correct now if you
didn't get this solution that's okay
math can be pretty tough so let's figure
out how to do this together first we
want to subtract 9 from both sides to
isolate this radical next we'll square
both sides to undo this radical or
square root so i'll have x squared minus
18x plus 81 on the left and X minus 3 on
the right we subtract X from both sides
and add 3 to both sides to get 0 on the
right and this expression on the left
now we want to find factors of 84 that
add to negative 19 this factor pair
would be negative 12 and negative 7 it's
pretty tough to find so this might have
been where you got stuck the easiest way
to find the factor pairs of 84 is to
start with one and 84 then you can just
go up to the next number to see if it
divides in evenly into 84 I know 84s
even so too does go into it we can try
each of the numbers going up and then we
can see that 7 and 12 would be the
factor pair we need they add to positive
19 so they must both be negative if
they're going to add to negative 19 and
multiply it positive 84 this is how we
know this must be our factor pair next
we can set each factor equal to zero and
solve for X so X could equal 12 or X
could equal positive 7 now keep in mind
we need to check these solutions we took
the square of both sides so we might
have picked up a route that won't work
in the original radical equation when we
check x equals 12 we get 12 equal to 12
so yes this answer does check but on the
right side with x equals 7 we don't get
an answer that checks will have 7 equal
to 11 which we know isn't true so we
remove 7 from our solution set leaving
us with just positive 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
