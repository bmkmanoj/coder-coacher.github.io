model and the evolutionary prototyping
model will work definitely you don't
want to have a pure waterfall model why
well because it is very expensive with a
pure waterfall model to make changes
during the course of the project
especially changes that involve
requirements why because we saw that it
can be very expensive whereas with the
spiral model we saw that being iterative
we can actually make correction
throughout development
similarly with evolutionary prototyping
we keep evolving our system based on the
customer feedback and therefore if
something changes we will get feedback
right away and we will be able to adapt
so the key thing here is that anything
that is iterative works better in the
case of changing environments so
situations in which you are requirements
the situation the project might change
whereas waterfall is more appropriate
for situations in which the requirements
are stable we know the domain and
possibly we also know the technologies
involved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
