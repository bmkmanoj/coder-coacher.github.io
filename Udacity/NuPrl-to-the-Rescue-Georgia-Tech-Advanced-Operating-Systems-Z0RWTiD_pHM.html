i mentioned already new pearl is a
theoretical framework and there is a way
by which the o camel code can be
converted a new pearl coat the tool that
allows the transformation to be done
very simply we use that tool to convert
the unoptimized o camel code to the new
Perl code and once you have the new Perl
code then we can roll up our sleeves and
say how do we go about optimizing this
new pull cord there are two step process
for this the first step is what is
called static optimization and this
requires that a new pearl expert and the
o camel experts it together and in a
semi-automatic manner they go layer by
layer in the protocol stack and identify
what transformation code can be applied
in order to optimize each of the layers
we are not going across layers but for
every layer we are asking the question
is it possible to simplify the
functionality of what is happening in
one layer by looking at the new pearl
code and using the new pearl framework
and the optimization theorems that is
part of that framework to come up with a
more optimized implementation of each
and every one of these layers that's
what we're doing in this first step this
is where both the new pearl expert and
the o camel expert have to sit together
because you want the new pearl expert to
know whether the optimization that they
are attempting to do is kosher with
respect to the functionality that is
desired in the o camel coat and that's
why there's a semi-automatic because the
optimization itself can be done using
the theorem proving framework but
whether that optimization is an
appropriate one or not is something that
has to be verified with manual
intervention and the kinds of code
transformations that can be done are
things like function inlining if you
have function calls then you can make
them in line and that is one way of
optimizing it within a layer and
directed equality substitution is
another optimization that can be done
there are some things that are very
specific to functional programming
leading to code simplicity and all of
those things are what is being done in
the static optimization of every layer
in the proto
scrag remember we're not going across
layers but every layer we're doing the
static optimization this is good but
unfortunately that's not enough because
we have lots of layers between a message
arriving and the application getting
that message or vice versa and what we
want to be able to do is if possible
collapse all these layers because when
we go through these multiple layers we
are adding latency to the overall
processing of any message and this is
where we are going to turn to the power
of the new Pearl theorem proving
framework so the next step is dynamic
optimization which is attempting to
collapse these multiple layers and it is
completely automatic the previous one I
said layer by layer we're doing
semi-automatic fashion this is
completely automatic and it is the power
of that theorem proving framework which
is actually going to do that for you and
in order for that theorem proving
framework to do this work what we need
to identify is what are common things
that happen in order to do this
collapsing of layers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
