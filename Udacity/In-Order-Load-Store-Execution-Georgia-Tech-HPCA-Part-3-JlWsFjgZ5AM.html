that we don't do out-of-order load/store
execution instead we do in order
load/store execution this is what
happens in that case the load is a Miss
the ad is stalled the store is stalled
because of that because they're both
waiting for the law to eventually finish
the subtraction gets done we now know
the address for this load at that point
in the load/store queue we will check
whether there are any preceding
instructions that might eventually
resolve to the same address or even
worse we check whether there is just all
preceding instructions are done because
this load is not done we are not gonna
consider this store for execution that
is for producing the value for this
address and as a result we're also not
gonna do this load so pretty much what
now happens is this load here doesn't go
to memory although it knows where the
address is eventually this miss is
resolved we compute our seven and then
very quickly afterwards we are gonna
compute the address for the store so now
what we have is this load gets done this
instruction was already done
eventually the ad gets done and
eventually the store gets done the store
is considered done not when it commits
but when it actually knows the address
and knows the value that is going to go
to that address at that point only this
load is allowed to proceed because at
that point it can just go up and check
whether any stores produce the value for
the address that we are interested in
and if so just grab the value so the
load can only finish after this store
has finished and this store will not do
anything until this load is done etc so
really we are executing most of the
instructions out of order here but loads
and stores are still proceeding in order
of course you can see that this is
suboptimal if the store doesn't store to
the same address we have been waiting
here for a very long time and thus we
have delayed all of the destructions
that depend on the load worse if the
load would have been a cache miss we
were sitting there not trying to order
things from memory until many many
cycles later potentially and only then
we realize we have a cache miss and have
to wait in many many cycles more so this
is of course not a very high performance
solution but it is a core
solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
