graphed the lines y equals x plus 10
over the quantity X plus 2 times the
quantity X minus 2 and of course our x
axis what are we interested in finding
though well because we have a less than
zero here we want to see where the pink
curve lies below the purple curve or
below the x axis this region down here
this sort of upside down you definitely
does and as we would expect the X values
here lie between negative 2 &amp;amp; 2 although
this curve will never actually have
points with either of these two X values
we'll talk about that more in a few
lessons get excited it's pretty cool
stuff for the other part of our solution
where X lies between negative infinity
and negative 10 we once again have a bit
of a hard time telling that the curve
drops below the x axis here but of
course you could plug in values for X
that are less than negative 10 and test
this out yourself
I think this is pretty cool though we
can use multiple graphs to demonstrate
the same solution sets and we can see
how to inequalities that look completely
different or at least pretty different
to me yield the exact same solutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
