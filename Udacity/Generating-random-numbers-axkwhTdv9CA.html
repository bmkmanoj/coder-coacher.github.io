functions to generate arrays filled with
random values these functions are
defined in numbers random module the
random function generates uniformly
sampled floating-point values between 0
&amp;amp; 1 with zero inclusive and one
exclusive more formally we can say that
it generates values in the half open
interval zero point zero and one point
zero let's go ahead and print this here
is the generated array with FiOS and
four columns note that we passed the
array shape as a tuple a slightly
variant of this function is Rand which
directly accepts a sequence of numbers
as arguments instead of a tuple it is
otherwise if we violate observe that we
directly pass the values of the rows and
columns to the function and did not
define a tuple here it is the array with
same shape as before Phi roles and 4
columns numpy provides this to achieve a
greater compatibility with the more
established MATLAB syntax we however
recommend using a more consistent numpy
function that explicitly accepts a shape
double now both the function Rand and
random sample uniformly from the range 0
and 1 what if you wanted to sample from
a different distribution to sample from
a Gaussian or normal distribution we can
use the normal function we call the
normal function from numpy dot random
and pass the shape of the array we
require let's run this the code produced
a 2 into 3 array of random numbers with
a standard normal distribution that is
zero mean and unit standard deviation
you can change the mean and the standard
deviation as well let's see how to do
that we change the mean to 50 and
standard deviation 210 now let's see the
output notice that the values are
centered around 50 to generate integers
we can use the randint function in one
of the several ways passing two values 0
and 10 will notify Rand int to generate
a single integer between the range 0 and
10 we can also
specify randint how many integers to be
one between zero and ten by specifying
the size attribute and giving it a value
so this statement will give us a 1d
array of five integers between the range
zero and ten going forward with that we
can pass a triple value to the attribute
size which will create a 2d array with
all the values between the range zero
and ten now let's see the output these
are the single random integers between
the range 0 and 10
next we created a 1d array with five
values note that we mentioned the number
of values needed in the one dimensional
array with the parameter size passing a
tuple to the size parameter gave us the
2d values and also note that all the
values of the array are between 0 and 10
check out the other random sampling
routines on the numpy website for more
distribution and usage variations find
