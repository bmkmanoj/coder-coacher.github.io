night terrors so Michael when did you
figure out you had night terrors when I
was about 13 in my teen years and found
out I was experiencing them a few times
a week even sometimes like three times
and a night and my parents just took me
to the pediatrician so what's it like to
live with night terrors it's exhausting
it's exhausting for me it's exhausting
for my wife and like when I was living
with my parents like family members just
because they're really intense and at
one point I was having them every night
like sometimes three times a night but
pretty much on a regular basis and
that's you know waking everybody up
having to deal with the situation and
then for myself feeling like I was
asleep the whole time but really I'm up
sprinting around screaming my lungs off
at whatever was going on and not not
knowing the next morning like why I was
exhausted and what's it like to have a
night terror episode sometimes they're
totally fuzzy I don't know what I did at
all until somebody wakes me up and tells
me other times you would remember
everything and the one that was the most
terrifying for me because I was the only
one that would wake myself up from them
was when somebody was coming after me
whether it was uh maybe was like a giant
spider it was like a person like lurking
in the room and you would just be
totally still eyes wide open really
sweating and I was afraid for my life
that if I budged or moved at all that
this de spider of this person or
whatever it was would come after me and
kill me or whatever and those were
terrifying because you're just you're
frozen and you're seeing everything
nobody's waking me up nothing I'm just
still all by myself and having to wake
up from that on my own the consistent
thing no matter if somebody wakes me up
or if I'm waking up myself from those
ones that are still you're just always
the next day
a bags under the eyes you're just tired
all the time because you're you're
you're running around in your sleep like
you're you're you're exerting energy in
a time when you should be relaxed and
your body should be refreshing itself
like you should be getting energy back
the other thing that I've discovered as
I get I get really mad I'm like very
aggressive when I'm like coming back out
of that that dream or whatever's going
on that I'm very I'm just very pissed
off I'm um I'm yelling at my wife like
stop it no I'm not just leave me alone
and then the next thing that comes into
that phase is just total shame I'm just
very embarrassed kind of curl up just I
don't because I whatever you see I swear
it's there I know it's there it's just
like looking at you right now I swear
that you're there but then somebody
wakes me up and goes nah you're you're
just having a night terror like and I
don't know if that's where it kicks in
that you get mad and and that I'm
aggressive in that way I don't know why
why that feeling comes over me but it
definitely scares me too the fact that I
don't want to hurt anybody
I definitely don't want to hurt my wife
and I hope it never comes that I mean
you know I even have a little one now
and that's definitely one thing that
terrifies me if I was to go running out
of the room or something and God forbid
I have something happened to her and
that's one thing it's always in the back
of my mind is you know I'm kind of I'm a
bigger guy and what would happen if that
happened is there anything that you want
people know about night terrors the
worst thing you could do and people that
I've been around me and experienced it
the worst thing you can do is to go
along with the person talking then to
them trying to figure out what's going
on the personal seem coherent like their
eyes will be open I'll have a full blown
conversation with somebody but I'm I'm
sleeping in I don't know what I'm gonna
do next I have no idea I've no control
of the situation
the what has control over
is whatever on picturing whether it's
spiders snakes whatever that that's what
has control not me that the situation if
you know somebody that has it if it's a
family member somebody that's going to
be around all the time try to keep the
door open
maybe have like a little nightlight out
in the hallway or something I know it
sounds kind of silly if you have like a
like for me I was a teenager you know
put a nightlight what are you talking
about but looking back on it it would
probably been the best thing for my my
dad and people trying to help me out
because they could see me it was so dark
all the time I go sprinting out of the
room and they don't know where I'm at
like you can't see anything so it's
little things like that that could help
me all night I don't know as far as
releasing my stress somehow kind of kept
to myself I don't know if I I talked
enough to people or to learn how to cope
with stress differently and I think
that's what end up happening has gotten
a habit of not telling anybody anything
and that was my way of coping was going
to sleep and thinking about it so I
don't know if there's other avenues that
way I just haven't figured it out yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
