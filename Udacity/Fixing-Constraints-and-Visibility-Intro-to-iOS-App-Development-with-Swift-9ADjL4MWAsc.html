needs to be somewhere here on the screen
which means that it needs to be centered
horizontally and a fixed distance away
from the microphone button let's add
these constraints to the label next so
what I'm going to do is hold down the
ctrl key on my keyboard click on the
label and then drag and when I let go I
am presented with this dialog and I will
select the center horizontally option
here which will Center my label
horizontally and then I will hold down
the control key one more time click on
the label and then drag towards the
microphone button and then create a
vertical spacing in between the button
the microphone button that is and the
label there now at this point if I open
the document outline I can see that I've
added a couple of new constraints here
there's the constraint for the vertical
space between the microphone button and
the label and there is the horizontal
alignment for the label okay let me go
ahead and close the document outline and
run this project again aha the label is
showing up in the correct location
although this label is showing up by
default the correct behavior would be
for this label to be hidden when the app
first launches so to fix this I will go
back to Xcode select my label and under
attributes inspector I will scroll down
to find this option called
hidden this will make sure that my label
is hidden by default you can actually
see a faint representation of it on the
storyboard let me run this app one more
time all right
the label does not show up by default</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
