is built on RSA and it uses RSA
signatures as we've seen in unit 4 but
this time instead of using them normally
we'll use them in a way that blinds the
message from the signer so here's the
protocol will assume Alice wants the
bank to sign a message and Alice knows
the bank's public key
it's an RSA key pair with the exponent
and a modulus so M is the message Alice
wants the bank to sign LS also picks a
random value we'll call that K next
Alice will compute T by multiplying the
message by K raised to the Eby power if
K is random selected from the integers
from 1 up to n be -1 and it's also
relatively prime to n be well that would
make K to the e be mod n be a
permutation of the values in ZB so that
means that this is also random in that
range and so M multiplied by this is
random this doesn't reveal to the bank
the value of M so we can safely send
that to the bank without leaking any
information and the bank will sign that
message using its private key it's
private exponent DB that produces the
value T to the DB power mod n which the
bank sends back to Alice so as far as
the bank is concerned it just signed a
random value and it sent that back to
Alice is there anything Alice can do
with this that's useful so the question
is which of these is equivalent to the
value produced by the bank here are the
choices to answer this question think
about the properties of RSA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
