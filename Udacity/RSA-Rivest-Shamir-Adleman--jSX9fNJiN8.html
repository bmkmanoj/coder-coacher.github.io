describe some of the most widely used
public key algorithms
the first is RSA named after its
amenties all become RSA is the most
widely used public key algorithm and one
of the very first RSA supports both
public key encryption and digital
signature the security strength of RSA
is based on the hypothesis that
factoring a very large number into two
primes is very hard problem that is
given a large number it is
computationally very hard to factor it
into two primes RSA can support variable
killings in practice most people use a
key length of 1024 bits or 2048 bits or
even 4096 bits the plaintext length can
also be variable in RSA every data is
treated as an integer because we can
interpret any data with bits of 1 and 0
as an integer and the requirement here
is that the plain text input has to be
smaller in integer value than the key
the size of ciphertext is the same as
the key length this summarizes the I say
algorithm the first step is key
generation first we select two prime
numbers P and Q say each of them are at
least 512 bits long and then we compute
P times Q the results n and y we have P
and Q we also compute total n which is P
minus 1 times Q minus 1 because both P
and Q are prime numbers let me select an
integer e that is relatively prime mm n
after we have selected a we find the
multiplicative inverse of e mod toshin n
having computed n e and D now we can
forget about P and Q and forget about
total n the public key is en n the
private key which we have to keep to
ourselves and secure it is DN n now for
encryption
suppose Alice has published her public
key and Bob wishes to send a message m
to Alice and he wants only Alice to be
able to read em so Bob obtains Alice's
public key and to encrypt message m Bob
computes M raised to the power of e mod
n for decryption only seed of this
ciphertext C Alice would use her own
private key D and camp you see raised to
power of T mod N and this would result
in the original plaintext M the property
of RSA guarantees that only Alice can
decrypt this message because only she
has a private key that's paired with the
public key that was used to encrypt the
message again every user can publish his
or her own public key and keep his or
her own private key securely to himself
or herself to incur message to a user
say Alice Bob will obtain Alice's public
key and compute the ciphertext by
raising the plaintext to power of e mod
n to decrypt Alice will use her own
private key to raise the ciphertext to
power of T and Emma em what about
creating digital signature Alice will
use her own private key to raise the
message m to power of T mod n to verify
but would get Alice's public key raised
the signature to power of yi and ma n
and this will produce the original
message m and verify the signature again
here the property of RSA guarantees that
but will know that the signature was
created by Alice because only she has
the private key that is paired with the
public key that Bob was able to use to
verify the signature</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
