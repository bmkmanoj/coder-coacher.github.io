own machine and you have some kind of a
terminal or a shell in which you can get
a command prompt you can type the
command Python and then give it the - M
flag which says module and then load
what's called the C profile module
lowercase C uppercase P and then the
name of your file that you want a
profile I call my crypt arithmetic file
crypt I execute that and you'll get a
nice table of where all the time goes
now if you don't have Python installed
so you or you can't run a command like
this you can do it from within Python
and what you'll have to do is say import
the C profile module and then do C
profile dot run and then a string to be
evaluated which is the code that you
want to run and then you'll see output
that looks like this so in the right
hand column we see the various functions
that are being called within my crip
program there are three main functions
all fill in and valid and then within
the regular expression module
I was calling search and compile and
then there's various other built-in
methods of Python such as the string
make trans function the eval function
and so on these other columns tell us
the number of times each of these
functions was called the total time
spent some percentage we won't worry
about that or that's time per call then
the cumulative time the total number of
time spent there so mostly I was just
calling solved that was about 75 seconds
and within that sixty two point seven
seconds went to valid so that's where
most the time is going so I should say
that most of these results are pretty
much what I was expecting I was a little
bit surprised that the re search took so
much time twelve seconds out of the 75
and I was also a little bit surprised
that this make trans and these other
methods the translate methods took so
little time just about three seconds
altogether if we want to make our
program faster it seems obvious that we
better look where the time is and out of
that 75 seconds 63 of it is with invalid
so that's where we have to look and of
valid 47 seconds is within eval if we
want to make our program faster and make
sense to concentrate our efforts on the
parts where most the time is it's not
just a good idea it's the law
it's called the law of diminishing
returns and the way the law works if we
imagine our total execution time as
being this bar here and if we said that
goes up to 75 seconds 63 of those
seconds was taken up by the call to
valid and 10 seconds was taken up by
fill in and then all the rest by
everything else we can see if we want to
make things faster we better make this
bar shorter or maybe this bar and it
won't help much to make these other bars
shorter so for example if we made fill
in and everything else vanishingly small
then if we didn't touch valid we'd still
have an execution time of 63 seconds
even if we can improve these infinitely
fast and we wouldn't help have helped
all that much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
