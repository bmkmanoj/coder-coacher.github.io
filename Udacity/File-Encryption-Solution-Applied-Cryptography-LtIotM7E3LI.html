both the lengths of em and which blocks
in the message are equal the attacker
learns the length because the length of
the ciphertext is actually equal to the
length of them the output for our
encryption function is the same length
as its input so we know that these
lengths are equal this assumed that the
file contents m were an even number of
blocks since we're dividing m into
blocks if it's not we'll have to do
something about that and we'll get to
that soon but the solution to that is to
add padding the other issue which is a
more serious one in this case is the
attacker learns which blocks in M are
equal this might not sound like such a
big problem if we're thinking of the
blocks as 128 random bits maybe the
probability that two blocks are equal is
actually very low we'll see later this
class it's not quite as low as you might
guess but the message is not random
dicks right the message of the file if
we're thinking of these as 8-bit
characters well 128 bits is only 16
characters if they're unicode characters
well then we have more than one byte per
character this could get down to a
pretty small number of characters
there's certainly lots of sequences and
many files that would be 16 characters
long that could be repeated so this is a
pretty large amount of information to
leak we want to find a way to encrypt
our file that doesn't do that ways of
using ciphers like this are called modes
of operation the one that I just
described is known as electronic
codebook mode and the reason for that is
you can think of having a book that for
each input message 128 bits of input
there are two to the 128 minus 1 inputs
you would be able to look up the value
of encrypting that message so you can
have a codebook that gives you for each
input the 128 bit output that
corresponds to that input and this would
be a really big book if we assume we
could get about 10,000 entries on a page
and each page weighs 5 grams well this
would be about one point seven times ten
to 32 kilograms to carry around and
that's just for one key so it's it's
really not practical to think of this as
being a physical codebook today but this
is really the same thing that the
early code books did they just provided
a one-to-one mapping between inputs and
keys and that's exactly how we're using
AES here is to provide that mapping and
we're using the same mapping every time
we need to encrypt the same value we're
getting the same output this is the
problem that we mentioned earlier that
it doesn't hide repetition in the
message another problem it has is that
someone could scramble an attacker could
move blocks around could replace blocks
could change things and it would still
decrypt to a perfectly valid message
just with the blocks in a different
order so those are problems with the
electronic codebook mode we're going to
look at some alternatives that avoid
some of those problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
