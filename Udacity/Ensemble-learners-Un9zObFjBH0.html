way to make the learners you've got
better so we're not talking about
creating a new algorithm but instead
assembling together several different
algorithms or several different models
to create an ensemble learner one thing
I want to emphasize here is that you can
take what you learn here about ensemble
learners and plug it right into what
you're already doing with your K and N
and linear regression models now what
we've been doing so far is we've had one
kind of learning method say KN we plug
our data into there and we learn a model
we can query our model with an X and
it'll give us a Y so this is not an
ensemble learner this is just a single
learner and the idea with ensemble
learners is that we have several
additional learners so we might have a
linear regression based model we might
have a decision tree based model we
might have a support vector machine
based model you could continue this on
with any different number of algorithms
they're all trained using the same data
and so now we have in this case four
different models to query this ensemble
of learners we query each model by
itself and combine the answers so if we
want to query this model with X we plug
X into each model the same X and then
our Y's come out so we have a Y output
from each of these models how do we
combine them if we're doing
classification where for instance we're
trying to identify what the thing is we
might have each of these Y's vote on
what it is but we're doing regression
and so the typical thing to do here is
to take the mean and that is the result
for this ensemble learner we can then
test this overall ensemble learner using
this test data that we set aside y
ensembles why do we use them why might
they be better well there's a few
reasons first of all ensembles often
have lower error than any individual
method by themselves ensemble learners
offer less overfitting the ensemble of
learners typically does not over fit as
much as any individual learner by itself
now why is that
here's at least an intuitive answer is
each kind of learner that you might use
has a sort of bias it's easiest to talk
about that in terms of linear regression
in terms of what is what do I mean by
bias so clearly with linear regression
our bias is that the data is linear KNN
has its own kind of bias decision trees
have their own kind of bias but when you
put them together you tend to reduce the
biases because they're fighting against
each other in some sort of way anyways
that's what an ensemble learner is like
if we use multiple types of learners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
