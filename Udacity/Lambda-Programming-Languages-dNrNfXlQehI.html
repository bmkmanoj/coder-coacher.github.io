at the end let's make this function more
complicated let's say that what I want
to do is find the word that has an L
closest to the end of it so for example
here in Bible the L is in position 4 in
Kingsolver it's in 0 1 2 3 4 or 5
position something I can't count 0 1 2 3
4 or 5 position 6 right and for the
others it's negative 1 well we can do
that with our find function so we'll
just pass in L pause and this should
work right actually there may be a bug
here let's see it in a minute huh that
didn't seem very good we got Bible
instead of Kingsolver what could go
wrong well now let's put back in some of
our debugging make sure all the steps
along the way are working out oh look at
this the F value is none every time why
is that I could have sworn I was writing
a function that was returning oh don't I
forgot the word return and the default
return value for a function is none if
you don't say anything so let's try
running it again and now the return
values are as expected and Kingsolver
which has an L in position 6 beats out
Bible with its L in position 3 and we
return Kingsolver now here I had to add
in two more lines just to make this
simple function turns out that Python
has a trick called lambda that lets you
make a function in the middle of nowhere
and it looks something like this here
instead of making this function L
position that returns were dot find I
use lambda which means make me a
function I don't have to call it
anything because I'm only going to use
it right here it's argument is word and
it's return value is word dot find L the
word return is implicit when you use
lambda just to make sure this is working
I will totally delete our definition of
L pause and add some some new super-long
this l comes last word and it should
beat out all the others actually it
won't now it will ho-ho case matters no
and here's our answer this function made
with lambda these are sometimes called
anonymous functions had exactly the same
semantics exactly the same meaning as
our previous L pause function negative 1
6 negative 1 negative 1 3 but now super
long this L comes last is 16 so it wins
so this time we saw together how to
write this function find max we also got
a little experience with writing lists
test cases where you typically want at
least order reverse and random and
another good one is actually empty but
in this problem description we were
guaranteed non empty a bit about how to
do print debugging everywhere there's
something interesting in your code you
just print out some values then you can
look at them and write at the end a
little bit about lambda super productive
I hope you'll join me next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
