a color see the additional course
materials for a link to the
documentation will cover four of them
here you start by defining the material
we'll talk more later about what this
material does for now just know that you
can set a color for it
if you don't set any color at all the
default is white the mesh Lambert
material object that you've just created
has several different parameters these
can be set when you first create the
object or later in a number of different
ways one of these parameters is the
materials color this parameter is of
type 3 color and you can use all the
methods associated with it one method is
to set the RG and B channels separately
here I'm setting the color to red this
directly sets the variables r g and b in
the color attribute to the desired
values i can also use the set RGB method
on the color class setting the color to
orange a more compact way to set a color
is to use hexadecimal numbers here I'm
setting a bright blue the value 0 x1 - 8
0 FF is a single number holding the red
green and blue channels all together
let's break it down the 0x prefix means
that this is a hexadecimal number base
16 where the letter A means 10 B means
11 on up to F meaning 15 if you don't
know about hexadecimal see the
additional course materials for link to
more information 3 channels are G and B
are each encoded in order treating each
2 digits as the channels value for
example the red channel is 1 - in
hexadecimal
this means 1 16 + 2 to give 18 in
decimal value Green is computed in a
similar fashion 8 times 16 + 0 gives a
level of 128 blue is at the maximum FF
adding up to 255 each of these values
can range from 0 to 255 the range 0 to
255 is used because most computer
monitors have 8 bits of precision for
each color channel 2 to the 8th power is
256
so the range 0 to 255 is the entire
range of possible color channel values
so once you have a color you like in 3
j/s you can conveniently just paste it
into place in fact there's a way of
initializing material to color when you
create it when you put something in
braces like this your
initializing that variable in the object
to the given value this particular
hexadecimal value gives a yellow color
note that the hexadecimal letters such
as the FC r can be upper or lower case
it doesn't matter I tend to use upper
case as it makes it more readable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
