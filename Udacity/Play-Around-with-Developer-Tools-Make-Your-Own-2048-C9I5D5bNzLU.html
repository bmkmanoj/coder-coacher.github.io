source code how did how'd you get
started I pride and do the right way
whatever that is
I just googled 20:48 source code okay
found myself on github
I felt very confused but I clicked
around a bit found some code copied and
pasted made some changes and then is
there a better way I'm guessing uh yeah
but well we'll talk about that a little
bit in more detail later but for now
let's just get a quick look at the code
right here in the browser so since we're
in chrome we can just right click and go
to inspect element okay and that brings
up the development tools okay this is
all the code that I had played with in
the wrong way that's cool yeah so this
is the this is the HTML here so that
gives the basic structure for the page
and then over here we've got the CSS
which gives the page its styling the
sort of look and feel okay cool so the
HTML from when I was going over this
this says things like we have head which
is the header and the body which is
basically the whole document and then
you keep going and we have that's the
heading we have above game-game
container and so on if you just hover
over these things it'll show you what
part of the page that element refers to
and can I modify this right in the
browser yes so if I were to delete yep
yes okay I'm gonna refresh cuz I don't
want to break anything okay so what
about what's going on over here um so
this is basically telling us you know
what what color things should be what
the the exact positioning of things
should be so for example it gives the
color for the background the main
background of the page here and what
does this mean i I see HTML and I see
body over here I see HTML I see body
here yeah so this is basically saying
this rule applies to HTML elements that
basically are called those things so
anything that starts with HTML or body
they're going to have these the
processor's okay and so if I click on
this background thing and I change it to
oh that is so cool okay nice so imagine
I am trying to figure out what's going
on here how should I spend the next five
minutes of my time just you know pull up
the page
right click inspect element sort of look
around the page figure out you know
maybe like delete some things see what
corresponds to what on the page okay
well I'll give it a shot all right cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
