of things this option is not right the
reason it's not right is this has no
electric field anywhere clearly if I put
a positive charge in the middle
somewhere it would go to the right
towards the negative charge so that
can't be right there must be some
electric field what about this one this
one has a weird shape well according to
this one if I put a charge here it would
feel a force upwards it looks like no
that doesn't make sense it should be
attracted more towards the negative
charge there's no reason for it to go up
so that's wrong these two look very
similar it's just a matter of whether
they point to the positive or point
towards a negative the correct answer is
they should point towards the negative
one thing that's really interesting is
to look at the strength of the electric
field and how we see that with these
pictures so for example right in between
these two charges the field would do
very strong you can see there's a high
density of field lines here this one
little drawing of made this little shape
three field lines have gone through
they're all tightly packed together
tightly packed field lines mean a strong
field way out over here I can draw a
similar area and no field lines are
going through it so the electric field
will be very weak over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
