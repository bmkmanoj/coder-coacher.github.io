there are lots of ways to do this and
building a robust scalable web service
is challenging for now what we're just
going to do is set up a simple service
running out our own machine depending on
how your machine is set up and your
internet service provider you might be
able to create a server that other
people in use that way but we're not
going to get into that now if you do
want to learn to build a scalable robust
externally hosted web service which I
hope many of you will I would strongly
encourage you to take Steve Huffman's
course on web application engineering
which is all about how to do that after
you finish this course but it turns out
that setting up a civil service running
on our own machine is surprisingly easy
we're going to do this by using a tool
called web pie despite being simple and
small it's still quite powerful it was
originally built as the web application
framework to run reddit to install it
all you need to do is use pip which
hopefully you have installed from unit 9
if not go back to unit 9 to see how to
install that or follow the links here
and install it like this and now we have
the web module available to us in Python
next I'm going to go a little bit
backwards from what we usually do i'm
going to show you all the code that we
need to get our search engine running as
a web application and then i'll explain
some parts of it but i think you can
figure out a lot yourself and please try
and do that so here's all the code we're
importing web pie if you have the search
engine code and you download this code
and you've installed the web PI module
you should be able to try this yourself
and see that it actually is running a
web service on your own machine this
code is in a file will call server pi
then we can start the web server in a
terminal by running python server pie
and we'll see that it prints out that
it's listening on port 8080 and it's
still running note that we haven't got a
new terminal prompt yet so let's try
using web browser to see what it's doing
and here you can use any browser you
want we'll use firefox browser and we're
going to make a request to the local
host so we'll make a request to our
local server we can get the local host
by doing all zeros or we could do local
host and the port number 80 80 and we
send a request we can see the server
print it out a message told us something
happened and that's done by the web pie
code
it's telling us that we got a request
and we got a response none we could do a
more interesting request and this time
I'll use localhost and after the server
import we can put the keyword we're
searching for so let's search for hummus
and now we actually see the response
from our lucky search this is the
response we get for hummus if we try
another key word that doesn't exist in
our index and we get none you can see in
the log the two requests that came in
one was it get for hummus one was a gift
for wisdom so if you got that working
you're running a web server you're
running a web application that responds
to queries we're not going to deal with
the complexities of making a nice form
and providing a pretty output in this
class but you've got the basic
functionality of a web server up and
running and you can do searches by
putting them in the URL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
