five can we choose this number and still
have this sum to nine and still have
these columns sum to 9 yeah let's say
three so together those make eight and
that means this one is forced it has to
be one ok can we pick a value here yeah
let's say 8
so those sum to 13 which means that this
value is forced this has to be negative
4 and then can we pick a value here and
have this row and this column still sum
to 9 yeah let's say 7 now if this column
has to sum to 9 then this entries forced
it's negative 1 and as you can see this
entries force 2
this adds to 15 so to add to 9 this
should be negative 6 and then this
entries forced as well
this has to be 14 then both this column
and this row sum to 9 so in this case
there are 4 degrees of freedom but if we
have an N by n table in this case this
is a 3 by 3 table this is a 4 by 4 table
then we would be able to choose all of
these entries but then these ones would
be forced this number of tiles is n
minus 1 in this number of tiles is also
n minus 1 so the total number that we
can choose is n minus 1 squared so here
in this 3x3 table we were able to choose
2 times 2 in this 4 by 4 table we were
able to choose 3 times 3 so when we have
an N by n table we can choose n minus 1
times n minus 1 or just n minus 1
squared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
