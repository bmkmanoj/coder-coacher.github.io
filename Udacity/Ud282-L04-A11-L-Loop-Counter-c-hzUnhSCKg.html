not only there to control how many times
the loop should iterate it can actually
be used inside the loop as a variable
let's see how say for example you want
to change the warning message to
actually say the number of the warning
it's displaying like warning number one
warning number two three four and five
this can be done by simply concatenating
our variable I to our warning message
here everything else can remain the same
let's trace this program and see what's
going on if we call our function raise
alarm by passing in the value of five so
number of warnings is equal to five we
start by initializing I to one and then
we compare I to the number of warnings
if it's less than or equal to five which
is true so we step inside our loop first
thing we're doing is we're printing out
warning number concatenated with I in
that case I is equal to one so this is
going to print out warning number one
we've reached the end of the loop so
what's the first thing we do we
increment I making it two and then once
we increment I we go window and do our
check to is less than or equal to five
and that's true so we step inside our
loop now I is equal to two so when we
concatenate it with warning number we
get the message warning number two
iterating so we increment I we do our
comparison and then we step inside
making warning number three because I is
three and the same for four we do our
comparison print it out and five print
it out and then once I become six we do
our comparison so six is no longer less
than or equal to five so we do not step
inside our loop and we just finish our
function we can do a lot of cool stuff
using the variable I because it keeps
changing as the loop increments however
you have to be very careful not to
change the variable I because it's still
used to control the loop let's have a
look at an example
this loop here starts with initializing
I to one and it keeps iterating as long
as I is less than or equal to three and
the increments
I buy one the first thing it does is it
takes away one from I and it prints out
I if we think of what this loop is doing
it obviously loops from 1 to 3 so it
goes 1 2 3 and then we're subtracting 1
and we're printing I so maybe we can
think that this would print 0 1 2 well
let's trace it and see what we get first
thing we do is we initialize I to 1 and
then we do our comparison is I less than
or equal to 3 yes it is so a step inside
and then the first thing we do is we
change I to be equal to I minus 1 so
that makes our 0 because we subtract 1
from I and that was 1 and we update I to
become that subtraction which is 0 and
then we print out I which in our case is
0 so the output becomes 0 we end our
loop we go back up here the first thing
we do is we increment I making it 1 and
then we do our comparison I less than or
equal to 3 yes it is so we step inside
our loop and we do this again we
subtract 1 from I which was 1 making it
0 and then we step into the print line
and print out 0 hmm or finish our loop
we go back up here we increment I to
become one again and of course 1 is
still less than or equal to 3 and that
keeps on happening over and over and
over this actually is called an infinite
loop because this loop would never end
it would keep repeating itself for
infinity you have to actually stop your
program and force to quit it infinite
loops are quite common if you're not
careful enough so feel free to use I as
part of your program inside the loop but
always be careful not to change it to
something that is not in your control in
this case the problem was because we
were assigning a value to I while I was
still being used as our loop counter and
because every time we incremented and
then decrement it again I would always
iterate between 1 and 0 and it would
never end because it would never reach 3
however if we employ
mentor lube this way then we're safe
let's have a look why the only change we
did is we created this new variable X
and when we subtract 1 from I we
actually store it in X rather than
update the variable I let's trace this
and see what happens
I starts by 1 and then we check if it's
less than or equal to 3 it is so we step
inside and then we update the valuable X
to be you I minus 1 so 1 minus 1 is 0 so
X becomes 0 and then we print out X so
our output becomes 0 we finish this
iteration so we go back up we add 1 to I
and notice here because I hasn't changed
so we're adding 1 to 1 and it becomes 2
2 is still less than or equal to 3 so
it's true so we step inside our loop and
then we update X to be I minus 1 I is 2
so X becomes 1 and then we print out X
which in our case is 1 so we print out 1
this is the end of this iteration we go
back up we increment I to make it 3 and
then we do our comparison and in this
case it's still true so we step inside
our loop we update X to become 2 and
then we print out X here we go back up
we increment I'm making it four but four
is no longer less than or equal to 3 so
we're not gonna even step into the loop
we're not gonna update X and we're not
gonna print out anything this is the end
of the loop the reason this was safe
compared to the infinite loop we had
earlier is because we were not updating
the variable I so the lesson learned
from this is that we are allowed to use
I as a variable as long as we don't
update it let's see another example
that's also safe in this example the
only thing we're doing inside the loop
is we're saying print line I times 2
notice that we're not updating I we're
just multiplying it by 2 as we're
printing it out so instead of printing
out I we're printing out twice hi let's
trace this program and see what's
happening the first thing is we
initialize I to be 1 and then we compare
it if it's less than or equal to 3 which
is true so we step inside we print out I
times 2 which is 2 because I is 1 we
reach the end of the
iteration we increment I to become to
the reason that this is okay is because
I hasn't changed so when we reached our
increment it was still one so it jumps
up to two as normal and then we do our
comparison is less than or equal to
three yes it is so we step inside we
print I times two is two
so the output would be four and then we
go back up we increment I to become
three three is still less than or equal
to three so we step inside and we print
out three times two which is six for
increment I which makes it four but four
is no longer less than or equal to three
so that's false and we don't print
anything once that condition becomes
false we do not step into the loop and
we just exit so there we go it's really
handy when we use the variable I or
whatever the loop counter is called
inside our loop remember that you could
also do this with while loops of course
just be very careful not to change it
let's have a look at how we can actually
use loops to calculate stuff for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
