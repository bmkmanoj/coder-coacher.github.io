HTML tags within a document and you did
that using mostly the string dot fine
method which works okay but it's fragile
and doesn't quite get everything quite
right the code you wrote was not
completely robust to having spaces and
line feeds and other things anywhere in
the text so we'd like to do something
that's a little bit more robust and so
your problem is to find these HTML tags
and in particular what I'm looking for
is dart tags so things like to begin and
then a would be a tag and a table would
be another one and so on I'm not looking
for the N tags so don't worry about
those just to start tags and then
something like a and then a set of
attribute value pairs and then a closing
angle bracket and so we're looking to
find all the instances that look like
that this whole thing angle bracket tag
optional set of parameters parameter
equal string these will have to be a
string and they have to be enclosed in
double quotes you can rely on that and
there won't be any double quotes within
the string that simplifies a little bit
and then the closing bracket but there
can be spaces anywhere and so on so I
want you to write a function call it
find tags which you pass it a text and
then it returns a list of strings that
look like that that come out of the text
and you can use whatever tools you found
you can use the regular expression
module r-e you can use the regular
expression parsers that we built you can
use the context-free parser that we
build whatever you think is appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
