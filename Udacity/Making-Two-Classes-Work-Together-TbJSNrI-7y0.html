represent the bedrooms in our house
follow along with me like we did before
ctrl-click on the house folder go to new
file choose cocoa class and we'll call
this class bedroom and of course we want
the language to be objective c okay so
now what should the properties of our
bedroom be I'm going to give it a bowl
to represent whether or not it has a
private bath and I also want a property
to represent which direction the window
faces I like it when my bedroom window
faces east so that I can see the Morning
Sun what's a good way to represent a
direction if this were Swift we
definitely use an enum that's what we'll
do here too but you'll notice that
objective c enums are pretty minimalist
compared to swift enums enum definitions
go at the top of your header file the
preferred way to create an enum is using
the NS enum macro where nsinteger is the
enum type and direction is the enum name
all items in objective-c are of type
nsinteger now that we've created our
direction enum we can add the property
direction window faces to our bedroom
class and now that our bedroom class is
ready let's go back into the house H
file and add a couple bedrooms to our
house hmmm what's going on here unknown
type name bedroom okay even though
they're in the same project the house
class can't see the bedroom class right
now we have to import it at the top of
the file like this looks like that calm
to the compiler and now we can use the
bedroom class from inside the house
