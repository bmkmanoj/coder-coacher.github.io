theorem of this lesson the max-flow
min-cut theorem it states that the
following are equivalent F is a maximum
flow in a flow Network G the residual
graph G F has no augmenting path and
there exists an ST cut a B such that the
value of the flow is equal to the value
of the cut this is the realization of
the strategy outlined earlier where we
were going to introduce the notion of a
cut show that it served as an upper
bound on the flow and then show that
ford-fulkerson produced a flow with the
same value as a cut so as an immediate
corollary we have then that the Ford
Fulkerson approach returns a maximum
flow let's see a proof of the theorem we
start by showing that if F is a maximum
flow in G then the residual graph has no
augmenting paths well suppose not and
let F prime be an augmenting flow then
we can augment F by F Prime and as we've
argued this will be a flow and the value
of the flow will be the sum of the
values of the individual flows which
must be strictly greater than the value
of F but we assumed it was a maximum so
that creates a contradiction next we
show that the fact that the residual
network has no augmenting path implies
that there's an ST cut whose capacity is
the same as the value of the flow this
is the real heart of the theorem we let
a be the set of vertices we can reach
from s in the residual graph G F and we
let B be the complement of a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
