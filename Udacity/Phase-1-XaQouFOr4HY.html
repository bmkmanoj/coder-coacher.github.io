system looks like from the outside and
how it is expected to behave you can
begin the architectural design process
this involves decomposing the system
into its components and allocating
responsibilities to them now we did this
before when we did this exercise but
that was an analysis model here when
we're talking about a courage
architectural design we're actually
going into the solution phase of things
now one of the features of object
oriented development is that it's often
the case that the particular elements
that we come out of the analysis with
our pieces there translate into pieces
into the architecture and ultimately
into the implementation in addition to
decomposing the system into its
components we have to allocate
responsibilities to the components for
handling those direct and indirect
effects of the events okay and we're
going to express that using ocl
invariance and in and pre and post
conditions to indicate how those
responsibilities are being satisfied</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
