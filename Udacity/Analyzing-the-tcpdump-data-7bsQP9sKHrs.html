TCP dump data is that there's a lot of
details here what is all this options
sack stuff we're not gonna look at that
in this course I'm gonna wave my magic
wand to make it go away I know it's kind
of silly to say it but don't panic about
the fact that this output probably looks
like a big pile of weird some parts of
it may jump out at you is already saying
something and if not right now
maybe where the end of this video so
there are some things in here you might
already recognize if you're using your
own data you'll see your machine's IP
address here here's mine notice that
just as we saw with ping sometimes it
shows up to the left this little angle
bracket and sometimes it shows up to the
right that's because some of these
packets are going from our machine to
example net and some of them are coming
back likewise here's the IP address for
example net if you want to check that
you can use the host command to look it
up in the DNS now let's look at
something that differs across these
packets at the end of each record
there's a length field that's telling us
how much data was sent in that packet
that's just the payload the actual HTTP
data as opposed to all the TCP overhead
like addresses and port numbers and such
so the interesting thing here is that
out of all of these packets only a few
of them even have any payload data for
most of them the length value is zero
this is an important fact about TCP even
before the client and server get to
exchange any real data they've got some
setup to do to bring up the connection
and after they're done with the real
data they have some teardown to do so
looking at the first of these that has
any real data
it says length 38 and the only other one
has length 321 where do those numbers
come from well let's look back at what
data we actually sent here's our HTTP
request and if you count these newline
characters at the end of each line is
only one it's the back slash doesn't
really count it's going to come out to
exactly 38 bytes which means that this
record in the TCP dump data exactly
represents the transmission of the HTTP
request from our client to the example
done that server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
