the exponential decay they start with
some initial number of particles and of
zero seconds and decay smoothly with
that exponential curve if we have this
area below that curve it's easy to say
that the mean lifetime egg hurts that
area divided by the initial number of
particles here comes a trick I
introduced a different area I start at a
time age close to zero and look at this
area it's called that a of H and
consequently call this a of zero seconds
the funny thing about a of Ages that
it's a scaled-down version of that
original red area if you multiply with
the right factor you're going to turn
that red area into that green area you
multiply with the right number to get
this curve from the blue curve and the
area below that curve equals that green
area and the right factor is easy to
figure out it's the ratio of the number
of particles present at time H to the
number of particles present initially so
this is n of H over N of 0 seconds for H
close to 0 we can use the differential
equation to get an estimate on n of H
the number of particles present at time
H that's the initial number - how many
particles F decayed if we use the rate
of change then it's 1 over 20 seconds
times the initial number times H the
time that we waited that's of course
just an estimate if I want this to be
more accurate I need to take care of the
remainder which is something of order H
squared and now here's a tiny area left
this area amounts to its width H times
its height the initial number of
particles where
but perfectly we are neglecting
something but debts of order h squared
and now let's put all of that together
the complete area the red area equals on
the blue area plus the green area so
that's the initial number of particles
minus one over twenty seconds times the
initial number of particles times h plus
something of the order of h squared
divided by the initial number of
particles times the total area and now
look at what remains we've got the
complete area on the left hand side and
we've got the initial number divided by
the initial number times the complete
area on the right hand side we can get
rid of these then we have terms that are
linear in H then we have terms that are
of first order in H H times the constant
H times the constant and we have terms
that are of second order in H the first
order terms have to match and the second
order terms have to match so we can get
rid of the second order terms now we can
cancel the initial number here and the
initial number there and you see that
zero equals H times the initial number
minus one over twenty seconds times H
times the complete area now we can also
get rid of H to find that the area
divided by the initial number equals
twenty seconds so this ratio which is
the mean lifetime equals guess what 20
seconds so astonishingly this number
that appears in the differential
equation is nothing but the mean
lifetime it's that easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
