looking at treating post-traumatic
stress disorder with MDMA and a few
questions one why MDMA out of all the
drugs to use if you could address that
first yeah actually the the last
surviving person with legal permission
to give LSD was a doctor Bastien's in
holland and he worked with LSD with
concentration camp survivors and a lot
of the concentration camp survivors not
only were Jews but were also dutch
resistance fighters and they later
became part of the Dutch government and
they protected him and there was a book
that was written by an Israeli Holocaust
survivor who went to the Netherlands to
receive LSD as part of this treatment
and the book is terrific it's called
Chevy T a vision but it's very difficult
to read not only because he's sharing
some of the things that happened to him
during the concentration camp but
because LSD itself is very challenging
and MDMA on the other hand is gentle in
a profound way so when we tried to
figure out what would be the drug that
would be most likely to make it through
the system first and become approved as
medicine what psychedelic drug would
make it first and then also what
clinical conditions should we pick and
so I spent a lot of times strategically
trying to evaluate that the reason why
MDMA I think is the top choice is
because it's not that fundamentally
different from our normal way of
processing that people when they take
MDMA they don't have the same kind of
challenge to their logical train of
thought so we felt that MDMA would be
something that psychiatrist and
psychotherapist would be more willing to
experiment with on their own so that
they could be more effective therapists
and then MDMA because of the way that it
reduces fear reactions it's got an ideal
treatment for post-traumatic stress
disorder it works really well and also
there's not a lot of effective
treatments for PTSD out there zoloft and
paxil are the only medications that are
available and they are marginally
effective most people say they're not
very
active at all and then there's a lot of
psychotherapy s that have been developed
like prolonged exposure and they work in
a significant group of people but
there's a lot of people for whom the
available treatments don't work so all
of that came together and the other
thing about MDMA we call it our Aikido
strategy of research which is that there
are hundreds of millions of dollars
about three hundred millions of dollars
we estimate have been spent on
scientific studies about what's bad with
MDMA and they're all in the public
domain and they've been funded by
governments of the world since the
middle 80s to try to justify prohibition
and because of that we're a small
nonprofit if we had to think about
making a drug into a medicine and we had
to spend 300 million on safety studies
we'd never get it so we're taking all of
this energy to demonize MDMA and turning
it around and saying we have an
incredible information about the safety
profile so in a way we want to focus on
demonize drugs that have been used by
tens of millions of people illegally
because the FDA when they approve a drug
it's been approved on the basis of
several thousand people at the most but
the 100,000 risk that happened somebody
dies from this or that or like allergies
to penicillin or aspirin people die from
those things but you don't find it in
the context of working with a few
thousand people so with MDMA where it's
been used by millions and millions of
people we know the risk profile so it
was a combination of the gentleness and
the profound nature of MDMA and its
effect on fear and there's a disease
PTSD that's accepted by FDA and there's
an excellent measure the caps the
clinician administered PTSD scale and
what's really good is that the progress
that people make therapeutically is
mapped very carefully by the caps in
contrast to work with end of life so
that we have people so the whole work
with psychedelics with LSD and
psilocybin and MDMA for end of life it's
more difficult to make that into a
medicine because when people become
ready to die that's not so clearly
captured on the state-trait anxiety
inventory
measures that have been used by the FDA
to approve drugs for anxiety so it's
it's a combination of all these factors
that led us to think about MDMA as our
drug and PTSD as our condition so that's
our basic model and people because of
what we're trying to do meaning making
this drug into a prescription medicine
and because there's such concerns about
the risks of MDMA we've decided to work
with the hardest cases so we work with
people that are chronic PTSD which means
they've had it for at least six months
and when somebody has had PTSD for six
months they're not likely to get better
on their own and we work only with
people that have failed on other
treatments so we were chronic treatment
resistant people with PTSD our first
study mostly women survivors of
childhood sexual abuse had PTSD an
average of over 19 years and had failed
on multiple courses of drugs in therapy
and over eighty percent of them no
longer had PTSD at the end of the two
months after their last MDMA session so
the setting we call it our psychedelic
bed and breakfast it is they're really
beautiful it's actually it's an office
that used to be a home so it's when it's
in an area of Charleston South Carolina
that's been renovated so it's all
commercial but it has a kitchen in it it
has a place for a night attendant to
spend the night we let people bring in
some of their family members if they
want to at night we tend to let people
at the end of the day bring their family
members in also if they wanted with the
therapy session and it's a male female
co therapists team so the essence of our
model is this two-person team because
they're there for eight hours and the
other you know they can take breaks a
little bit to go eat or go to the
bathroom but we want one person there
are always with the subject and then the
idea the male-female team is that if we
can sort of model successful
communication a lot of people have not
had you know supportive parents or their
relationships haven't been so good and
also for safety so women have been raped
or something to have just one person
there you know man therapist is kind of
risky also so for all these different
reasons we
a male-female team we're experimenting
now we're one of the team would need to
be a licensed psychiatrist or therapist
and the other could be a student
learning to be a social worker or
learning to be a psychologist or
psychotherapist and so that accomplishes
two things it reduces our costs so that
because we're able to fund this only
through donations but it also provides a
way to train the next generation of
therapists if you talk a little bit
about the properties and how you can use
that therapeutically and why kids say
it's a psychedelic what they're trying
to experience yeah I think there's a
maybe it will help to describe the
difference between LSD in MDMA and so
there's a way in which LSD dissolves the
ego dissolves the the control structures
of our brain and then people are sort of
flooded with more material that they've
been trying to suppress and then also
they can have the sense of connection
where a lot of information that they've
suppressed once the things come to the
surface they can feel more connected and
the sense of unity is what then is the
epitome of sort of the mystical
experience so the classic psychedelics
lead more towards this kind of
psychedelic mystical experience MDMA on
the other hand strengthens the ego it
strengthens self-acceptance and it
doesn't challenge the ego but you become
so comfortable in yourself that you can
become less self-centered in a way and
see the wider world there was a linguist
at Harvard that was looking for reading
the transcripts of our sessions and she
did an analysis and she figured out how
to tell who got the placebo and who got
the MDMA in a way that none of us
noticed and what she figured out is that
at one point or another the people who
got the MDMA asked the therapists how
they were feeling oh so that you're more
attuned to the other which is why it's
so good for couples therapy or couples /
relationships the other thing is that
MDMA stimulates oxytocin and prolactin
so the hormones of nursing a bonding of
love of relationships are stimulated by
MDMA so people feel more related and
more
connected which is why we're starting a
new project for MDMA for autistic adults
now it's not I mean logically it makes
sense but what really started us is that
there in the age of the Internet there's
all these people who are doing all these
different drugs and posting reports and
there's a large number of reports on the
Internet of people who were Asperger's
or autism who took MDMA on their own and
could understand emotions and could
communicate better Matheny and there's a
woman Alicia Danforth who's speaking at
the conference who did her PhD
dissertation on contacting all these
people as many as word she could
identify and asking them how MDMA was
useful to them and on the basis of that
we've designed a protocol and we've
submitted the FDA we should be hearing
any day now or next week whether the FDA
will accept this protocol or whether
they want us to make some changes but we
feel pretty good that the FDA will say
yes but I think the application of MDMA
to autism to people that don't know how
to read emotions and others and don't
really understand their own emotions
it's a tremendous opportunity and I
think a lot of it has to do this
hormonal release aspect of MDMA all
right excellent well fascinating stuff
thank you so much for your time we
really appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
