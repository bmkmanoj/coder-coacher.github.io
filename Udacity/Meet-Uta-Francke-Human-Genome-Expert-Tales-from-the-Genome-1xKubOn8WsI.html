originally from Germany as you can hear
and I'm an emeritus professor here at
Stanford and also senior medical
director at 23andme you know there were
early estimates of the size of the
genome simply by measuring the amount of
DNA in a Cell people could do that a
long time ago and so the estimate was in
that range of three billion base pairs
but the idea to actually sequence it was
came up in the mid 80s when capillary
sequencing was developed and many people
thought it was a absolutely crazy idea
because it's so huge so much information
the other thing to know about the Human
Genome Project when it finally got
started about 1990 the first five years
were devoted to just mapping the
chromosomes you know people heard about
chromosomes and we know that DNA runs in
chromosomes from one end to another so
it would make sense logical sense to
start sequencing at one end and then go
through but instead what people did they
made maps of the chromosomes and then
you could focus in on specific region
and do the sequencing there and also to
find genes that are located in specific
chromosome regions I see so instead of
having to sort of like you say sequence
from one into the other you could have
many starting places in the middle of a
chromosome and sort of read out from
there right and you could relate the
sequence to the chromosomal features
because chromosomes when they are
treated with a certain agent display
banding patterns that are very unique
therefore we can identify each
chromosome individually which is
something you cannot know when they are
uniformly stained and also we can see
within each chromosome there are certain
regions and now we can find out in which
region certain genes are located and all
of this physical mapping as it's called
was done before the sequencing even
started so what happened when the
sequencing project started you mentioned
it was an international collaboration
was this really countries all over the
world or were they more from one region
or another well there were countries who
had developed infrastructure to take on
such a big project and in Europe it was
predominantly say you
france and germany and canada was a
player as well as japan and china and
all of these people got together under
the chairmanship so to say ah Francis
Collins who is now the director of the
NIH he was organizing this big
international thing and made sure there
wasn't too much waste and duplication
they were dividing up the chromosomes
rakia you do chromosome 21 okay that's
where we are focusing on and then they
had regular meetings they exchanged
information all the results were
immediately shared and put online and
therefore because of this international
effort this led to success where are we
now with sequencing the human genome or
many human genomes are we multiple
drafts beyond and are we reaching out to
many people the international effort had
many different people involved so the
genome was a composite of sequences of
many individuals and that's called the
reference genome but what you really
want to know is what is different
between the genomes of different people
who are live in different parts of the
world and that was the next effort and
to really sequence individuals with
known as Nick background and find out
what are the variations between humans
and that's when it really became
interesting and I took another 10 years
to become really useful to have that
information what does the size of a
genome mean does it mean anything at all
well there are some organisms with the
huge genomes like the salamanders you
know and what is all that sequence it's
probably has no informational content
sometimes genomes get big because
viruses get in and they replicate they
make copies of themselves and that has
no useful function so there is only a
smaller part of the genome that's really
important because it has function and
this is something we're still working on
unraveling the functions you also
mentioned repetitive DNA when you were
talking about some of I guess the
historical context of the genome and
even once we sequenced it if anyone does
any research on their own they might
find that there's still a lot of
repetitive
regions what do we know about those in
the genome you know most of them are
just remnants I mean they were copies
made of some early viral intruder and
now they are degenerated their bits and
pieces of them but there are still some
active copies and what they can do they
can still make copies of themselves and
they can jump around and insert
somewhere else in the genome and
actually cause problems they can cause
disease by inserting into an important
protein coding genes so we are not done
with dealing with all these repetitive
sequences they're still changing and
that means there was huge variability
from one person to another as well I
think that's an amazing concept to to
think about our genomes we sort of think
of them as okay we have the static
genome and it may interact with itself
to create a protein or regulation but
the genome itself is changing even today
