problems at the bottom small and just
show you the answers to the first three
then we move on to the last two later so
here is the work and the answers for the
first three problems we have X is less
than negative 3x is greater than or
equal to negative 2 and x is greater
than three of course with this last one
we started out with X on the right side
of the equation and some people prefer
to put the variable on the left side in
the answer so if you want to follow that
convention then to get X onto the left
side you also need to flip the
inequality so that it's facing the
opposite direction saying that three is
less than X is also the same as saying x
is greater than three and now moving on
to our last two problems and after
several steps we end up with X is
greater than or equal to 4 and x is
greater than 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
