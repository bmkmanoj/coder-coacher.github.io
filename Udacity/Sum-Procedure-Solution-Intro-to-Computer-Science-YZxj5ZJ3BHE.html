it'll make the computer do some work
when we call some but there's no good
reason to ever call this procedure it
doesn't have a return so it doesn't
produce any output and it doesn't
actually modify the value of the first
input in any way that's visible to the
caller it does modify the value of a
inside sum but the caller can actually
see that so let's see that in the Python
interpreter so we make sure we
understand what's going on here
so we'll define some to take those two
inputs and have the body that assigns to
a the value a plus B and we can try
printing the result of calling sum let's
see if it can add 1+1 when we run this
what we'll see is the result is actually
none
the reason the results none is well the
sum procedure doesn't actually return
anything so there's no value here Python
uses the special value none to mean
there's no value so that's not very
useful we could pass in bigger numbers
whatever we pass in we'll still get the
result none because some never returns
anything to make sure it's clear what's
going on here we're going to add some
print statements to some printing things
out is actually a perfectly good and
perfectly useful way to test your code
to make sure that you understand what's
going on it's always a good idea to add
print statements sometimes we call this
debugging if the code has problems
adding print statements to see more
what's going on is a good way to figure
that out here I'm going to print that
I've entered some and I'll print the
value of a and I'll do the same thing
again so now when we run it we see that
we enter some when we enter some the
value of a is 2 that was the value
passed in as the first parameter the
value of B is 123
that was what we passed in as the second
input when we print out the first print
a is 2 we see a is 2 we do the
arithmetic that changes the value of a
so now running the same print prints out
the value of a is 125 then we return we
have the result the result is none
there's no output from some and that's
what gets printed out so if we add a
return statement to sum now we have the
original code that we had I've removed
the print statements
so we don't need to see those again we
have this and now we've added a return
statement now when we run this we do get
the value 125 because the output of sum
is what's returned here which is the
result of a at this point which is 2
plus 123 the other thing I want to make
clear without the return is that if we
passed in variables for this it still
does not change their value so let's say
we have a variable I'll even use a so
I'm going to use the variable a we'll
initialize it to 2 we'll have the
variable B we'll initialize that to 123
we'll call some we still don't have the
return so it will return no value and
let's see if the value of a has changed
at the end and it hasn't and the reason
it hasn't is what gets passed in here
even when we have a complex expression
even when we use a name or we have some
calculation that produces the value what
gets passed in is the value that that
evaluates to so the fact that it was a
name doesn't matter when we call some
what's getting passed in as the value of
a is the value that a refers to which is
the number 2 we don't actually modify
what the variable is that's a totally
separate variable so let me draw what
that looks like to make it clear what's
going on so here we have our code and so
that introduced a name a and it refers
to the value 2 and it introduced a name
B and that refers to the value 123 both
of those are numbers and we have our
procedure that we define like this takes
the two inputs it changes the value of
the input named a and we're going to
call some passing in a and B so what
happens when we call some we have these
names here the name server parameters
we're going to have a name inside some
that's a that a is going to refer to
whatever value is passed in here so to
know what the value is we evaluate the
name a we get the value to this a will
refer to the value 2 B will refer to the
value passed in as B that's going to be
the number 123 and then when we were on
some we do the assignment that's going
to produce the new number adding 2 plus
123 we get
the value 125 and then we do the
assignment the assignment changes what a
refers to now instead of referring to
the number to the a that corresponds to
the parameter to the procedure sum now
refers to the number 125 note that the
original value of a the one that we
named here still refers to two when we
come back from the procedure so once we
get to here we return we're back to
running the code here all of the
parameters that were visible inside the
body of sum those are no longer visible
they were there for that execution but
they're done we can't use those names
anymore
they were only visible during that
execution of the procedure so now at
this point a refers to the number two
just like it did before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
