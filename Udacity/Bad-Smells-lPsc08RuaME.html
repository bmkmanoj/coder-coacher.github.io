the notion of refactoring as part of
extreme programming in the 1990s the
idea was to move some design activities
that were previously done before
implementation was started into the
actual implementation phase of
development the intent was to reduce
rework in situations with rapidly
changing requirements the first step in
refactoring is the recognition of bad
smells which are code situations that
are suggestive of design problems such
as duplicate code too many comments or
long classes so you can think of bad
smells as being things to avoid in other
words design principles describing
situations which you you don't want to
be in the Fowler's book recognizes
dozens of bad smells and the avoidance
of each should be could be thought of as
a design principle for example the
duplicate code bad smell should be
thought of as the avoid duplicate code
by factoring principle you're encouraged
to explore Fowler's book as a way of
becoming familiar with these situations
