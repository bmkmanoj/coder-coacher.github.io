use all three in this week's homework
when we implement a procedure called
tone mapping on an image generally tone
mapping is the process of converting one
set of colors and to another set of
colors the reason we want to do this is
typically to take a raw image that
accurately measures light intensity and
map it onto some physical medium which
might be a piece of paper or a
television or your computer monitor the
problem is that a real world scene can
have brightnesses that span many orders
of magnitude and intensity a piece of
white paper in bright sunlight is
literally a billion times brighter than
on a dark night and an output device
like a CRT can only represent about two
orders of magnitude between its
brightest and least bright pixel so how
do we do this mapping here if we do a
bad job then we'll have images that are
either too washed out overly bright or
instead overly dark let's take a quick
look at some pictures to see why this is
important there's a couple lovely images
of old Saint Paul's and Wellington New
Zealand licensed by the photographer
Dean Pemberton under the Creative
Commons license thanks Dean what we see
here is two different exposures of the
interior of this building if you look at
the darker image here you'll see most of
it is quite dark and it's so it shows a
little detail if we look at the brighter
image we see a lot more detail in some
areas but bright parts of the image like
the stained glass window are completely
washed out we can classify this in terms
of histograms in the dark image most of
the pixels are at the low end of an
intensity histogram and in the light
image they're at the high end what tone
mapping does is remaps those colors so
they do a better job spanning the entire
color range the intensity spectrum thus
will look closer to this and the
homework you'll implement a classic an
excellent tone mapping algorithm
developed by Greg Ward this algorithm
uses all three of the algorithms you
learn today reduce scan and histogram to
implement such a tone mapping good luck
and we'll see you in the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
