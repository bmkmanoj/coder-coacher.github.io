nice break there as you can see I'm well
I'm totally actually it's in it's
another decade I just kind of look the
same so what we've done is we've laid
out sort of the general idea of a Markov
process
Markov system and also a hidden Markov
model and what I want to do now is talk
about sort of three computational
problems of hidden Markov models and
then we'll talk just about a simple
application of this to computer vision
also just as a word note I am NOT going
to go into the detail of different parts
of lots of the math just one part of it
and then the rest Allah as they say I
were leave it to the reader or the
viewer as an exercise to go get schooled
up in it because the details were less
important than knowing that it could be
done and then it was applied to computer
vision all right so we have a hidden
Markov model and we said that our hidden
Markov model is a lambda is a triplet of
a B and pi where a is the transition
probability B or the emission
probabilities and pi was just the
distribution of where things started
well given that a hmm given a machine
there are three computational problems
we can look at and the first one is this
basically given some observation
sequence okay so remember o 1 through o
capti are the observed outputs from 1 to
capti so that's a particular sequence
you could ask what is the probability P
of o given that machine that is what's
the likelihood that that machine
generating that particular sequence and
this is really the classification
recognition process problem but actually
how you use it for that right assume
I've got a couple different hmms maybe
three of them and they each represent an
activity and let's assume that the prior
of which activity is going on or equal
right so then once I've if I the priors
are equal all I care about is the
likelihood of the data given the model
and the hmm would allow me to evaluate
the likelihood of the observed sequence
for each of the given models whichever
one was highest that would be the one I
picked that's a generative model like we
talked about before so the valuation
problem is substance the key problem at
run
it's one will actually talk about
another problem is what's called
decoding the sequence so remember you
have a sequence of observations and the
question is what's the single most
likely sequence of states to have
generated that sequence of observations
so it's not all possible ways these
observations could generate it's just
the single most likely sequence
sometimes called the decoding problem
and sometimes you care about that
sometimes you don't when you do it
basically has to do with saying well if
I if the states have some particular
meaning to me right remember we talked
about sunny rainy cloudy so you might
have some specific meaning I might want
to say okay here's what I think the
underlying state sequence is actually
sometimes in a genome work etc they
actually want to know what the
underlying state sequence would be but
if you're actually just doing it for
recognition then that's some sense less
important and then the third problem is
in some sense the most complicated
problem and that is okay I give you a
bunch of training examples a bunch of
these Oh sequences train a model learn
the lambda that and the way you learn is
you pick the one that maximizes the
likelihood of getting that observation
it's a maximum likelihood method it's
actually called e/m expectation
maximization and we'll talk about that
just a little bit we won't actually do
the math of that part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
