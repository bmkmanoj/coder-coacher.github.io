expressions or use them before then this
review is for you if you have feel free
to skip to the next video let's start by
reviewing what you know about finding a
substring within a string suppose we
have a string called s in Python now you
may know that we can find a substring
within it for example s dot find of word
will return the position in which the
string word occurs within s and return
that index if it exists
so in fact word does exist so it will
return that index 0 1 2 3 4 and so on it
turns out the answer is 21 and if it
didn't exist at all then by convention
it would return -1 to indicate failure
because minus 1 is not a valid index but
suppose we aren't looking for exactly
one individual word suppose there's a
whole family of words that we want to
find take a crazy example let's say
we're interested in the family of words
used by sheep there's a sheep and what
do they say well she can say baa baa and
so on let's say we interested in the
family of words that have a b and an a
and then any number of mores and then an
exclamation point
we can't specify that as a single word
for find or even as a finite set of
words because there's an infinite set of
words and so what a regular expression
is is a way of describing that infinite
set of words and an interface that
allows you to find them so a regular
expression which will also call a
pattern is a way of describing this
infinite set of possible words will
describe it as a string and the string
starts with a B and is necessarily
followed by an A and then followed by
any number of subsequent A's and for
that we'll use a special notation a star
or a asterisk the asterisk means any
number of the preceding character and
then it has to end in a
Galatian point so that's there so the
Asterix is a special character the
exclamation point the A's and the B's
are normal characters and this regular
expression or pattern specifies this
infinite language of Baz with any number
of A's more than one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
