to develop the public interface of the
class the methods that one might want to
call an object of a class but we've
always pretty much given to you the
instance variables because it turns out
that picking the right instance
variables isn't all that simple well now
the time has come for you to do more of
that yourself and I'd like to give you a
few rules of thumb on how you might
discover instance variables to see how
those rules of thumb work let's have
another look at the car class from
lesson 3 that class had an instance
variable to hold the amount of gas in
the tank there was a method to add gas
where the parameter value would be added
to the gas and tank now the point that I
want to make is there is a certain
pattern here you have a quantity here
here you make that quantity bigger it
also gets smaller when the car is driven
I like to call that pattern keeping a
total and it occurs in many classes not
just the car so there lots of times
where you have some class and you have
some variable which may be called total
or not and then there are some methods
that add to the total maybe some methods
that clear the total or subtract from it
I'll give you a few situations and I'll
ask you whether the pattern of keeping a
total applies so would you keep a total
to model the account balance in a bank
account friends in a social network a
car or domitor stripes in a flag check
all where you think the pattern makes
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
