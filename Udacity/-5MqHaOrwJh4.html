lists are very powerful that by using
mutation by having lists that could
contain other lists or any other kind of
data we want we can build very complex
data structures and we can do lots of
interesting things I'm going to
introduce one more list operation which
will allow us to add a new element at
the end of the list so we've seen that
we can use lists to store complex data
the elements of the list can be any type
we want including other lists and we've
seen that we can use mutation to change
the value of a list and that mutation is
visible through any reference to the
same list object so now I'm going to
introduce some other list operations
the first one is append and append is
like a procedure but it's a method so we
use it similar to the way we use find on
strings we'll have a list first then a
dot followed by append and what we pass
in is the element we want to append to
the list so append will add a new
element to the end of a list and the
important thing about a pen is its
mutating the list that it's invoked on
it's not creating a new list it's
mutating the old list so as an example
of the use of the pend let's assume that
instead of replacing curly in the Three
Stooges we want to end up with force to
G's will add Shemp and keep the other
three as they are so what we want to do
is to pen Shemp at the end of the list
we have we would do that by invoking
append on the Stooges passing in the
string Shemp has the input so here's
what happens after the first assignment
the name Stooges refers to the list
containing the three elements Moe Larry
and curly when we invoke append it
modifies that object adding a new
element to it so after the pend
the list that Stooges refers to now has
four elements we have not created a new
list note that there's no assignment
from the result of append what we've
done is modify the value that Stooges
refers to by adding a new element to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
