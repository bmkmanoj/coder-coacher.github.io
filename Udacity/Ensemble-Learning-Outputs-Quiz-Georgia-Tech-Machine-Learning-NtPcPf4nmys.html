here's the setup you ready you've got n
data points the learner that you're
going to use over your sub sets is a
zero or polynomial the way you're going
to combine the output of the learners is
by averaging them so it's just what
we've been talking about so far and your
subsets are going to be constructed in
the following way you uniformly randomly
pick them and you ended up with in
different subsets they're disjoint and
each one has a single point in it that
happens to be one of the data points
okay I think I get that right so if you
look over here I'm on your left you got
a graph of some data points and this is
one subset this is another subset that's
another subset that's another subset
that's another subset that's another
subset that's another subset got it yeah
now what do you want to know about it
now what I want to know is when you do
you're in samba learning you you learn
all these different you learn all these
these different rules and then you
combine them what is the output going to
be what does the unsung below output and
you want a number
I want a description and if the answer
is a number that's a perfectly fine
description but I'll give you a hint
it's a short description short
description of the answer okay all right
I'll think about it
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
