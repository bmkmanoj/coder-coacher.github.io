and then I worked at Microsoft and then
I went to Google at Google I worked on
desktop and gmail and I started lively
and then after google i started sunfire
which is a co-working space and then I
kind of fell in love with minted minted
is a start-up we crowdsource graphic
design and art from a community all over
the world and then other people can
customize and purchase that so I
actually started programming basic when
I was five but I didn't actually know
what I was doing my parents bought this
radio shack gaming device because was
cheaper than other devices and then
there was a basic emulator and I would
pro great programs it came with a book
programs and we actually did not buy a
memory cartridge so we type every
program every time I wanted to enter it
and then eventually I would start
modifying it a little bit so some people
start later but are very addicted and
spend lots of time thinking about it or
playing with programs and so then if you
start later but spend more time it's the
same as a woman you understand the
psychology of a very powerful consumer
in the market but who is
underrepresented in the people creating
products which is a very powerful
position so for example at minted our
demographic is women and that means that
we are serving this very underserved
market that has a lot of spending power
more money spent by female consumers
than by male consumers we primary look
for people who are strong programmers so
people who like to build consumer web
sites and probably who have done that
before whether it's for other companies
for classroom projects or for open
source or personal projects people who
have worked with object-oriented
programming so we happen to use Python
and then on the front end we use
JavaScript and jQuery but anybody's
worked with either object-oriented
programming or whose build consumer web
sites would be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
