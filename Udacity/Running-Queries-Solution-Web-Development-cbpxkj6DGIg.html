order by created ascending okay so
remember a table it's called art I hope
I didn't confuse you by adding the s
here we I think we will accept both but
our class name is arts and so that's the
name of the table so select star from
art and remember all gql queries have to
say select star so I had no choice there
and then order by that's how you sort
something created and this is our
property that represents when this
particular piece of art was submitted
and since we want most recent first we
add deaths for descending at the end of
this query
okay let's go ahead and add this to our
program okay so I've written the sequel
select star from art order by created
descending you know I use multiple lines
here who makes a little bit easier to
read and that's going to store this
there was the result from this query
which is actually going to be a cursor
the cursor is just a pointer to the
results and this variable called arts
and let's go ahead and pass in arts to
our template and let's go to our
template and make use of it so below our
form this is going to get a little fancy
we're gonna display all the artwork
we've received submitted so I'm gonna
start with an HR which just draws a line
across the page and then I can use a
loop in this template this is gonna be
actually it's going to be Python code
embedded in our HTML you don't have to
understand it but that's what I'm doing
for art in arts this little curly
percent syntax is used by Jinja the
template language to separate HTML from
Python we're gonna create a div we're
gonna call it art remember this class
doesn't do anything until we add the
styles and we haven't added any styles
yet so it's just it basically just
creates a new line div class equals art
title again another div doesn't do
anything yet we're just going to put the
art the art title in here this is how we
include a variable remember the double
curlies so for art in arts I'm going to
use I'm going to take that art here and
access its title and this object art
here is actually an instance of this
class art here and it has a title so we
can access the title using the period
syntax then we close those Curly's
because our div
and then we're gonna add the art body
I'm gonna use the pre tag the pre tag is
a handy little tag that basically
preserves the whitespace that is inside
it so remember how we talked about HTML
how it converts all spaces to a single
space and all new lines to a single new
line that's why we can you know indent
our HTML because there's actually all
these spaces between all these tags and
things just print as you'd expect them
to the pre tag basically says anything
but any whitespace between this pre tag
is pre formatted and it's going to stay
that way and so we're gonna include our
art dot art now remember this art here
that's a little confusing I realize this
art here refers to this instance of our
art class and our art class actually has
a property called art which is actually
the text of the art itself so that's
what we're going to include there and
then we're going to close our div and
we're going to end our loop and that's
the end of our HTML file let's review
what we just added for every art art
surrender this HTML remember arts comes
from this query that we run here this
gql query to select all of the art I'm
gonna store that in a variable called
arts and we're gonna pass it into our
template okay so let's go to our browser
here we've got our page and now when I
reload this page I should see all of our
artwork haha and here is the camel we
submitted there's the title and there's
the camel let's submit a new piece of
art</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
