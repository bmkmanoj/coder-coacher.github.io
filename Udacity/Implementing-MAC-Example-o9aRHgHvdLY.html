idea of labels that a mandatory access
control policy would use in a DoD
Department of Defense kind of
environment a little bit more by looking
at some examples so information is gonna
have a classification and user is going
to have clearances okay so the highest
sensitivity typically is top secret
that's the innermost one and secret
confidential it and and going out we
have this unclassified we said you know
this information anyone can see so most
sensitive this sensitive this is we said
the level at which somebody is cleared
or the classification level of a
document
so we said label is going to be a
sensitivity level so for example it
could be top secret here and a
compartment that describes what kind of
data is contained in the document so
we're going to let's say look at
documents one that is top secret
and let's say these documents have
information about various arms stock
files so this document lets it talks
about nuclear and and chemical weapons
you hear about them in the news so you
know this is clearly extremely sensitive
so we're going to say that is top secret
and the document contains information
about both nuclear and and chemical
weapons we have another document that
has information about let's say
conventional so maybe it's sensitive but
just a notch below so let's say this is
only secret so we have two labels here
l1 l1 sensitivity level is TS comma the
compartment is nuclear comma chemical
remember this this compartment here
looks like I said okay so the document
may pretend to multiple topics or areas
each one of them could be in this and
that's the description of that document
you using the set of terms that we have
here so l1 is TS comma nuclear chemical
l2 is secret s comma nuclear
conventional using these labels l1 and
l2 we're actually going to be able to
decide access control in the end comes
to being able to read and write
documents because that's what you do to
files or documents we actually you know
when disclosure or confid
today is an issue there is a model Bell
and lava chula model or DLP model that
makes use of labels exactly like the l1
and l2 that we have here and actually
the model is defined by a set of rules
that tell you when based on these labels
you can read or write but implementation
of mandatory access control is always
going to require some kind of labels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
