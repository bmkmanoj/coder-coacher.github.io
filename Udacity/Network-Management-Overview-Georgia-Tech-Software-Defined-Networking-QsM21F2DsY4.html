where we will be discussing network
operations and management this segment
in the course has three lessons the
first lesson is focused on Software
Defined Networking and its role in
making network operations and management
easier the second module covers traffic
engineering which is the process by
which network operators reconfigure the
network to balance traffic demands
across the network the third lesson
covers network security we will start
with a lesson on software-defined
networking but Before we jump into the
details
I'd like to motivate a little bit why in
particular I plan to tell you about the
role of network operators in running the
network so what is network management
network management is the process of
configuring the network to achieve a
variety of tasks network configuration
achieves a variety of tasks including
balancing traffic load across the
network achieving various security goals
and satisfying business relationships
that may exist between the network
that's being configured and neighboring
networks such as the network's upstream
Internet service provider a key aspect
to network management is configuring the
network unfortunately if the network is
not configured correctly many things can
go wrong configuration mistakes can lead
to problems such as persistent
oscillation whereby routers can't agree
on a route to a destination loops where
packets get stuck in between two or more
routers and never actually make it to
the destination partitions whereby the
network is split into two or more
segments that are not connected and
black holes where packets reach a router
that does not know what to do with the
packet and drops it as opposed to
sending it on to its ultimate
destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
