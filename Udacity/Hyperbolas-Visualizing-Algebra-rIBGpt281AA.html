ellipse we start at the center at the
origin 0 0 and then we move two units
left and right in the x-direction and
then we move 3 units in the Y direction
up and down this gives us four main
points on our ellipse so that way we can
graph it easily we're going to use this
knowledge of ellipses to help us graph
hyperbola a hyperbola is another type of
conic section and it's equation looks
more like this notice that the
difference between a hyperbola equation
and an ellipse equation is this
subtraction sign here for ellipses we
have addition between the x squared term
and the y squared term but for
hyperbolas we have subtraction between
the terms one is positive and one is
negative to graph this hyperbola we're
going to start by graphing it as an
ellipse so we'll start with this shape
that we already have now those first
four points were helpful for graphing
the start of our lips and they're also
going to be helpful for graphing our
hyperbola will draw a dashed rectangle
around our lips so that way we can start
graphing our hyperbola once we have the
rectangle will draw dashed lines across
the diagonals now this minus sign is
like a knife it's going to cut open our
ellipse and then we're going to pivot
these two halves outward these two
points will become the vertices of two
branches that will face this way and
this way so notice I'm going to take off
my lips now and graph my hyperbola
notice how the branches of this
hyperbola approach the diagonals from
the rectangle the same is true for this
branch the ends of the graph approached
the dashed line and this will always be
true for our hyperbola the ends will
always stretch towards the diagonals
that we created from before now one
other important piece of information is
that the x squared term comes first here
this means that our parabola opens to
the left and to the right and you might
be wondering how could I get a parabola
to open up and open down well it turns
out
we just have the y squared term come
first for example if I make this y
squared term positive here and we
subtract off x squared divided by 4 here
will have a different type of hyperbola
since the y squared term comes first
this hyperbola will open up and will
open down I'm going to take this
hyperbola off for now and then we'll
start over with our basic ellipse now I
could switch the order of the Y squared
in the x squared terms since addition is
commutative so I'm just going to move
this term to the right side of the Y
squared divided by 9 and notice when I
make this change I still have the same
exact ellipse as from before we started
with our center at the origin and we
went two units left and right from that
center and three units vertically up and
down this time to get this hyperbola
will do one thing different we'll still
draw our box around our lips and we'll
have the diagonals to that box now we'll
use these two points as the vertices for
the two hyperbola branches they'll face
this way the subtraction sign is going
to be the knife that cuts our lips in
half and then the top and bottom of your
lips will fold outward to create our
hyperbola so taking away our lips will
get this as our hyperbola and again
notice that we have the y squared term
coming first which means the parabola
opens up and it opens damn now that
you've seen a couple hyperbolas try
creating some on your own try changing
the values of the denominators and see
how the hyper blows change have some fun
and then continue on with the practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
