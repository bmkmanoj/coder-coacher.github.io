possible that language influences
thought and it may be that some things
are easier in one language than another
in the world of computing the languages
that we are considering like Python and
JavaScript are ultimately equally
expressive in a strong formal sense
however we often still think that some
things are easier that is maybe they
take you a little less time to write or
they're a little easier to read they
feel a little more natural in one
language than another you may just
prefer writing code in Python to writing
code in JavaScript even though
ultimately you could say all of the same
things in JavaScript one may feel a
little easier to you even though the end
results would be the same so I assert
that interpreting or translating between
two systems of meaning is actually a
very deep concept and one interesting
downside for us is that simulating a
program interpreting it translating it
often requires running it let's see how
that plays out here I've written a
simple Python program the sort that may
we might want to translate or interpret
into JavaScript and then back again and
what I'd like to know is what does it do
maybe it prints zero I've listed a few
options I want you to think about this
program in your head and tell me what
will happen if I run it check all that
apply bearing in mind that i am trying
to trip you up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
