approvals to automate manual tasks
you'll learn how to automate sending an
email updating a field and creating a
task for users to do that let's go back
with Samantha and Andy we've got this
really cool thing there's dashboard that
shows all this data about things like
money and the bands playing and this is
interesting this data about the tickets
the open maintenance items that need to
get fixed yep and so you know we've
thought about how to collect the data
but really there's people doing these
things right we need to tell them what
to do so we need to automate actually
notifying the people involved with the
maintenance ticket so they can get
started you know fixing those problems
right away yeah I mean so can we make it
so that you know a ticket gets created
and then immediately a technician gets
alerted or something like that
definitely so what you're describing
sounds a lot like a workflow process
this is taking like something that's a
manual process and automating it using a
set of actions so in the case of
maintenance tickets maybe you'll want to
update a field or send an email to this
maintenance worker or give them a task
you can do all that using just point
click configurations on your workflow
it's cool
let's do it yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
