properties to this class this is how you
do it you say title equals and then DB
string property this is this is in the
database module from Google and this is
how you say something as a is a
particular type you give you a property
name and then you say equals and then
you give it a type and this is the class
that represents the string type string
I'm going to add a another parameter
here acquired equals true and this sets
a constraint on the database
it means if we try to make an instance
of art without giving it a title we will
get an exception Python won't let us do
that which is which is handy you know
you want to always have as many
constraints as you reasonably can to
prevent you from making silly mistakes
I'm putting bad data into your database
having bad data in your database is
really annoying sometimes it's really
hard to find because you know you don't
have the appropriate keys to do your
queries to look it up so constraints are
important and this is a this is a handy
one that Google provides required equals
true let's add another field this is our
art this is going to be a DB text
property this will also be required
equals true simple enough actually the
first time I wrote this I use the the
string property and then I got through
this whole whole project and all of a
sudden I couldn't paste in ASCII art
longer than 500 characters so text is
handy there and we're also going to add
our last field for created which would
be a a date/time property and this takes
another parameter called Auto now ad
equals true and what this property does
is it automatically when we create an
instance of art we'll set the creative
to be the current time right now and so
we don't have to actually deal with that
ourselves this is really handy now you
may be thinking this is an awful lot to
know and you don't have to know this
this is all in the Google Data store
Docs so when you're working on your
homeworks and stuff please have those
Doc's handy it'll save you you know a
lot of heartache and there's there's
some interesting stuff in there and this
is this is one of them Auto now add okay
so that's all we have to do to define a
type at least our simple type here let's
go ahead and start creating these things
