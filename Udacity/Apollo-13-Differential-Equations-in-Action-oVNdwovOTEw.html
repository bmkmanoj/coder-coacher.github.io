happened with Apollo 13 the rocket is
already in a parking orbit around Earth
to take us to the moon the rocket is
fired again
this purpose out in such a trajectory
this face here is called translunar
injection the trajectory is a so-called
free trajectory it's going to return
safely without the astronauts doing
anything about it so in case anything
breaks we're going to return no matter
of what just by gravity the first thing
that happens was planned namely to get
rid of the rest of the rocket which
eventually crashed on the moon the
second thing was planned as well a
mid-course correction MCC the objective
was to take the spacecraft to a
trajectory that's closer around the moon
but there was a price to pay this
trajectory no longer was a free return
trajectory but eventually did not return
to Earth so that's a unsafe trajectory
which everybody learned somehow was
after that when one of the or two tanks
exploded
now the spacecraft had to be taken back
to earth as quickly as possible
the solution was to fire the rocket
again this maneuver was called DPS one
for descent for passion' system the
rocket that has been fired actually was
the rocket that was the rocket that was
intended to safely land on the moon this
has to be fired in such a way that we
are taken back to a free return
trajectory and eventually return to
Earth what's going to occupy us this
next unit is how to compute the right
amount of acceleration the spacecraft
needs at this point of time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
