with this abstraction of distributed
shared memory in a cluster the idea is
that we want to give the illusion to the
application programmer writing an
explicitly parallel program that all of
the memory that's in the entire cluster
is shared they are not physically shared
but the DSM library is going to give the
allusion to the threads running on each
one of these processors that all of this
memory is shared and therefore they have
an easier transition path for instance
from going from a sequential program or
going from a program that they've
written on an SMP to a program that runs
on a cluster because they don't have to
think in terms of message passing but
they can think in terms of shared memory
sharing pointers across the entire
cluster and so on also since we are
providing a shared memory semantics in
the DSM library for the application
program there is no need for marshalling
and unmarshal in arguments that are
being passed from one processor to
another and so on all of that is being
handled by the fact that there is shared
memory so when you make a procedure call
and that procedure call is touching some
portion of memory that happens to be on
a remote memory that memory is going to
magically become available to the thread
that is making that procedure called in
other words the DSM abstraction gives
the same level of comfort to a
programmer who's used to programming on
a true shared memory machine when they
move to a cluster because they can use
the same set of primitives like locks
and barriers for synchronization and the
pthread style of creating threads that
will run on different nodes of the
cluster and that's the advantage of the
DSM style of writing an explicitly
parallel program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
