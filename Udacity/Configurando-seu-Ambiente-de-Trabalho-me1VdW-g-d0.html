ready to start coding in your own
environment now to help you get started
we will be giving you downloadable file
so we call starter code and you can use
these to follow along with the
instructors when you're done with a
lesson these files will become handy
reference guides as you continue on in
the nanodegree at key points in your
nanodegree you will see pages just like
this one each page will have a link for
download two starter code for the
upcoming section you can find that link
under downloadables at the bottom of
this classroom in this case I'll click
on this file called variables and will
open in a new tab then I can simply copy
and paste this text into my text editor
of choice for me that's sublime now if
you're using sublime and a lot of other
text editors you'll notice that when you
first copy and paste it it doesn't
format the text correctly but if I save
my file in this case I'll just call it
variables pie and the dot pie refers to
Python to tell the computer it's a
Python file then I can see that sublime
formats the text correctly we recommend
that you open these files and a sublime
window next to your browser just like I
have here and just like how Mike keeps
his documentation open next to his code
you'll notice that every starter code
file begins with the name of the lesson
a short summary of the lessons concepts
a link to the first video in the lesson
and some code that illustrates the
lessons ideas as you continue along in a
lesson you should add to this file
however you'd like you can add code you
can add notes just whatever makes sense
to you whatever would make a good
reference now let's walk through this
next lesson together to see some best
practices for using starter code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
