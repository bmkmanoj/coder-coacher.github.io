chiller out here since the point for
launch the users are happy our investors
are happy and now that we've got Sherri
implemented most of the features we want
in the app / basically done I've even
had enough capital to hire palter on as
our attorney and data scientist that's
so great to hear it sounds like you're
on track to a very successful launch
wait GP you're doing that thing what you
know that thing you do when you're
worried about something but you don't
want to say it uh well you know you're
both doing so well I don't want to rain
on your parade I was just wondering if
you looked into some of the other
features firebase offers okay like what
well for example in version point five
if you have time you could look into
providing some basic offline access
firebase provides a few methods that
make it very simple to cash and persist
your data locally even when your
internet connection is shoddy after that
you might want to take a look at
firebases offerings for authorization
and validation a JSON database like
firebase can accept basically any
mishmash of key value pairs fryer base
allows you to write some data rules
server-side then enforce the structure
of your data in addition you can write
permission rules that based off of your
users authentication status allow you to
control readwrite access to the data
okay JP well think about it right now
i'm working on a slide deck for
investors but i guess i could have the
developer look into some of that but
really GP it's not like he was actively
trying to attack us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
