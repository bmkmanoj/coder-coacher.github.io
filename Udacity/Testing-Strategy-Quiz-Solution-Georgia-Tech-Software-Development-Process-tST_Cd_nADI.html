true that because of pay programming we
need twice as many developers in fact
that there is some evidence that even
though in pair programming we have two
developers working together that the
overall efficiency of the programmers is
not really affected by the use of this
practice in XP code is rarely changed
after being written this is also
definitely false in fact in XP there is
a lot of emphasis on change on the fact
that the code can be changed can be
redesigned because of the fact that when
we do that we have a set of test cases
that we can use to check right away that
the code still works as expected so
again in XP it's all about steering
rather than just driving down one fixed
direction and therefore the code can be
changed so this statement is false it is
definitely true that XP follows the test
driven development paradigm in XP we
first write tests and then we write the
code which is exactly what TDD is about
it is not true that the customer does
not need to provide requirements in XP
the customer does provide requirements
in the form of user stories and the user
stories are the starting point of the
development process finally XP is
definitely an iterative software
development process in fact we saw that
XP is based on subsequent iterations of
the same cycle in which we select from a
set of story cards or user stories the
stories that we want to implement in the
next iteration based on that we
developed a scarred and then we use the
test card to write this case and then to
write code and we continue this cycle in
an iterative way until we are done with
all the story cards and all the user
stories so definitely XP is an iterative
software development process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
