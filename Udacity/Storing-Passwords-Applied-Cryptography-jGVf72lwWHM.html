look at an application that combines
many of the things we've seen so far and
our goal is to figure out how to use
passwords to do authentication we're
going to assume that we have some file
or database to keep track of users and
for each user we want to keep track of
something that will allow us to
authenticate that user in UNIX this file
is stored in etc password so our goal is
that even if some malicious insider or
someone who can compromised our system
can it get access to the database or the
password file they won't be able to
impersonate users they won't be able to
log in by just being able to read this
file if they can modify this file that's
another story but let's assume that they
can't modify it they can just read it
this is not a completely unrealistic
model this is actually the model that
motivated the design of the UNIX
password system that there are lots of
people that need to read this password
file but only very privileged
applications that need to write to it so
the really bad idea number one is to
just keep the passwords in clear-text
and there are actually are web
applications that do that and any web
application that actually does that is
doing something's very very wrong
first of all it's wrong to send a
password and email especially one that
was created by a user but it also means
that they're actually storing your
password in a way that they can recover
it and that probably means that anyone
else who has access to a database can
also recover it so we want to do
something better we want to provide this
property that even if someone can get
access to the database and read all the
user and password information they can't
break in to your account so that was
really bad idea number zero keeping the
passwords in clear-text now we're going
to move on to really bad idea number one
which sounds a little bit more plausible
but is not a good way to store passwords
and so here's the plan the server
operator will generate some key let's
assume the server can generate a good
random key and for each password we're
going to store the encrypted value of
that password encrypting using the key
using cfb mode so that's cipher feedback
mode with message block size eight so
that will allow us to use this for any
size string eight is the number of bits
per character that could be seven or
eight
how we encode the characters the
question is why is this a really bad
idea here are all the possible choices
select all the ones that apply that it
reveals the length of the password that
the encrypted text reveals when two
users have the same password that it
requires use of e an encryption function
which is slower than using a hash
function that if the key is compromised
that reveals all of the passwords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
