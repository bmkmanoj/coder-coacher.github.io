first align my right hand to the
directions given in the beta X South Z
west and why up if I could do it then I
know the system was right-handed easy
enough my right hand lines just fine if
I tried the same thing with my left hand
I can get two out of three axes to a
line but the third is always in the
opposite direction so we know the beta
version of Minecraft used right hand
coordinates I could solve the second
half of the question by reorienting my
right hand and again noticing that the
fingers can properly align with the axes
so it is also right-handed however you
don't really need to use your hands to
figure this out what happened within the
world itself was simply that the Sun
started to rise from a different
direction none of the world's data had
changed at all the only thing that had
changed was our perception of which
direction was east since the world was
the same as before the underlying
coordinate system itself had not changed
realizing this I could conclude that the
released version is still right-handed
just like the beta but it never hurts to
check with my right hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
