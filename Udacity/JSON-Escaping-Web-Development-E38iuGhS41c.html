we had to escape our HTML content so it
renders appropriately in the browser if
not we covered that in unit 2 I believe
jason has a similar issue so you know if
we have this little JSON blob you know
of a little dictionary that takes the
Keen story and maps it to the string
once upon a time now this is valid JSON
our key is surrounded by double quotes
and our values surrounded by double
quotes what if we want to include double
quotes in our value and if I were to
just put a double quoting here this
would cause invalid JSON because this
quote actually ends this string and then
we've got a bunch of garbage after the
string you know we would need a comma in
another opening curly brace you know all
sorts of things that totally screwed
things up let's see what would happen if
we tried to use that in our terminal
real quick I'm going to take that JSON
string that we just loaded so this
actually works I'm using our Python
string is actually this whole piece this
is the J this is this the JSON string
we're sending in the Python and it's
surrounded by single quotes remember and
Python you can use either single quotes
or double quotes to delineate a string
and that's what we're going to use here
we new single quotes so we can use the
double quotes inside the JSON and that
works just fine and if I were to do what
I just did in the editor and replace
this P with a quote let's see what
happens explosion you know that the JSON
parser did not like that at all the way
we get around that is we escape this
quote by putting a slash in front of it
this escapes the quote in Python but
what this turns into is still basically
the same string we had before which is
just the quote I actually have to escape
both the slash and the quote for this to
work in Python so basically this slash
is the python escaped for this / which
basically says we're inserting a slash
in the string and yes we mean to do that
the JSON interpreter will see that / and
say okay they must mean to include this
quote and let's give this a run there we
go the other way to do this in Python
that's a little simpler instead of using
double slashes which is kind of
confusing is we can put an R in front of
our string which says this is a raw
string which basically means Python
ignore any escaping we're doing in here
for the purposes of Python and let the
JSON module interpret this / however it
will and if we run this it also works
with our quote in the value the answer
as we just saw if we want to include a
quote in our value is to input a slash
in front of
and that's the you that we have there
before so we have to escape our quotes
with a slash this is not a big issue
when we're reading JSON because we
assume that to JSON we're going to be
reading is valid and if it's not valid
our JSON module will tell us it'll throw
an exception when we try to read it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
