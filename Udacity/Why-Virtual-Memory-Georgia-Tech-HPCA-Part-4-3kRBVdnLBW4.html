works let's first see why do we even
want to have virtual memory and the
short answer is that we want to have
virtual memory because the programmer
and the hardware have different views of
what memory means in the hardware view
the machine has some memory modules with
an actual amount of memory that can be
accessed by the real processor let's say
that this module is 2 gigabytes and this
module is 2 gigabytes so what the
harder' really has is 4 gigabytes of
memory and the addresses for this 4
gigabytes are going to be 0 through 4
gigabytes in contrast the programmers
view of memory is that it's a huge array
with addresses that go from 0 to a very
very large number if it's a 64-bit
machine this is many many gigabytes
obviously this is much more than what
the machine really has some of this
memory might be reserved for the system
some of this memory contains the actual
program instructions some of it is for
static data then we have the memory for
the heap which is where malloc finds its
memory and this heap can grow and then
some of it usually very high in the
memory address space is the stack and
that typically grows this way but the
programmer doesn't really want to be
bothered by how much space is there
between the heap and the stack what they
want to do is simply malloc or push
things on the stack and they never run
out of memory and in a 64-bit address
space chances are they won't actually
run out of memory but the problem is the
actual amount of memory that they're
using might be less or it might be much
more than the actual memory that the
machine has here things are actually
much more complicated because we
typically don't run only one program on
a machine we actually are simultaneously
having multiple programs run you might
be having something that browses files
here an mp3 player playing in the
background and the word processor here
each of these sees the address space
that begins at zero and ends at a very
large address we don't want to write our
programs so that this needs to run as
the first program in the system this
needs to run as the second program in
the system you want to write the program
as if it was the only program in the
system and then just run multiple
programs like that but that means that
this program's idea of memory is it
thinks it has all of this memory this
program
similarly thinks it has all of this
memory so as far as these two programs
are concerned for example their code
might well be at the same address in
each program although in fact they have
different instructions at those
addresses so virtual memory is a way of
reconciling how the programmers view
memory and how the hardware actually
needs to view memory in order to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
