nano degree program I'm Caroline Bucky
and before I joined Udacity I did a
combination of software engineering and
machine learning now there's more data
in the world today than there ever has
been and it's constantly growing from
sources like transaction records sensor
data even people taking photos or videos
on their cell phones we're collecting
more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
every day because of this data analysts
have never been in higher demand by
completing this nano degree program
you'll have the qualifications you need
to either start or advance your career
as a data analyst and you'll build a
portfolio of projects to prove it to
start out you'll use statistics to
analyze the Stroop effect a classic
result in experimental psychology then
you'll go through the entire data
analysis process starting by posing a
question and finishing by sharing your
findings then you'll hone in on your
data wrangling skills by cleaning
OpenStreetMap data for a part of the
world you care about next you'll use
exploratory data analysis techniques to
build intuition about a data set by
exploring both individual variables and
how those variables interact you'll also
use machine learning and natural
language processing to uncover fraud in
the infamous Enron scandal you'll create
an effective data visualization that
will tell an engaging an unforgettable
story for your audience and finally
you'll analyze an a/b test that Udacity
ran recommend whether or not to launch
the change and propose your own
follow-up experiment building these
projects won't be easy we're going to
challenge you so you're prepared to
solve tough problems and think
independently to rise to that challenge
you'll need to keep up with your
learning schedule and engage with your
nanodegree community your fellow
students are here to help you untangle
the trickiest puzzles get over the
biggest hurdles and encourage you
through all of it and when they need
help you'll do the same for them the
