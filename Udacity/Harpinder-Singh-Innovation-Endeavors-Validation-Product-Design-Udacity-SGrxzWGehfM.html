partner at innovation endeavors and the
CEO of slice thank you for joining us
thank you it's pleasure to be here so
how did you become an entrepreneur so my
journey is a little bit different from
most other entrepreneurs
I met my co-founders at Stanford
Business School back in 2000 and we were
working together on a business plan
before we graduated and that idea did
not pan out but we really enjoyed
working together as a team so we were
essentially a team before an idea and we
all decided to commit six months we
decided to say no to the jobs and we
invested some of our own money and went
through a structure search process for
about six months we looked at a few
different spaces several different ideas
and our benchmark was can we get excited
about something ourselves and you know
do we want to spend the next six seven
years doing it so that's what we did we
created a company called fiber Tower it
was a wireless infrastructure company
which we built and sold after about six
to seven years and we took some time off
and the same team came together and we
did the same exact process looked at a
few different spaces few different ideas
and created slice out of it and the
common theme was we at that time felt
that Wireless was growing a lot and
e-commerce receipts were growing and we
felt the data would be very valuable so
that's what we've done two times so how
do I determine that my idea is the right
idea to build a business around us as an
investor and as a founder the answer may
be somewhat different as an investor I
am definitely trying to see is this
potentially a big market a high-growth
market does it give you enough room for
exploration and for errors so that's one
thing that's important and then the
second is do you have some defense
ability at least for a few years till
you create room for yourself and as a
founder this couple of other factors
that become important I mean as a
founder it's not always clear from the
beginning is a big
market is this like a mega market and so
on so you generally want to pick big
markets but you're picking problems that
you can relate to personally and I like
to pick problems that have some kind of
defense ability around technology around
or around the data component so you want
to create some barrier that the guy run
across the street just can do overnight
so shouldn't intrapreneur find a small
niche or think big from the start you
know it depends on how you define niche
snapchatters niche Instagram is a niche
but these are big companies I think
there's a couple of different ways to
think about it I have friends who have
acquired small companies and you know
ten million dollar revenue companies and
grown them to 30 50 million dollar
revenues and grow the eBay does and
they've created a lot of shareholder
value I think the traditional Silicon
Valley would look at that and say hey
that's not big so if you're thinking
technology if you're thinking Silicon
Valley especially if you're thinking
about raising venture capital then I
think the bar is different people are
looking for billion dollar-plus outcomes
and dear by definition you're looking
for big markets ability to accumulate
large user bases and so on so it really
depends on what your strengths are are
you are you more of an operator that
wants to optimize are you more of an
innovator that wants to sort of create
magic and have this thing that that can
just sort of grow to be something
unimaginable and there are trade-offs
you know it depends on how much capital
do you want to raise it depends on what
kind of employees will you attract how
much ownership will you retain and
really what is the core competence of
the business is it design and product is
it operations is it sales so it really I
think there is no one answer to this
people have created a lot of shareholder
value from what might seem small versus
you know what what seem like mega hits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
