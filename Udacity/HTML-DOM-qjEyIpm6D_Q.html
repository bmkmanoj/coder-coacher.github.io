browser sends a request to the server
for example we can simulate this right
on a command line once the browser
receives the response which is the HTML
we see here it must somehow convert all
of the mark-up into something that we
see on the screen here ever wonder how
that happens you know how to mention it
it does feel a little bit like magic
it's not magic
the browser follows a well-defined set
of steps and it all starts with
processing the HTML and building the Dom
the HTML specification contains a set of
rules for how we should process the
received data for example the text
contained within the angle brackets has
special meaning in HTML and is set to be
a tag as a result whenever we encounter
attack the browser emits a token in this
case it is the start tag HTML token next
we would get the start tag head token
and so on this entire process is done by
the tokenizer and while the tokenizer is
doing this work there's another process
that is consuming these tokens and is
converting them to node objects for
example we convert the first HTML token
and create the HTML node then we consume
the next token and create the head node
is there a relationship between the
nodes yes notice that the tokenizer
emits start and end tokens which tells
us the relationship between the nodes
the start tag head token comes before an
tag HTML token which tells us that the
head token is a child of HTML similarly
the meta and Link nodes are children of
the head node and so on eventually once
we consume all of the tokens we arrive
at the document object model or simply
dung which is a tree structure that
captures the content and properties of
the HTML and all the relationships
between the nodes cool so we've
converted the HTML to the document
object model it's pretty easy to see why
it's called the Dom tree yeah also note
that these objects contain all of their
properties for example the image node
has a source attribute and this node
right here would also have the same
property the Dom is the full parse
representation of the HTML markup
okay so we downloaded all the HTML and
built it on got it alright what's next
actually the browser constructs the Dom
incrementally and you can take advantage
of this to speed up the rendering of
your pages in fact this is something
that the Google search pages do really
really well let me show you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
