first of all it's important to notice
that a ram that has the if-better
function available is at least as
powerful as a normal ram because all
we're adding is this additional
instruction but we can still do anything
that we could do before so this year is
clearly a checkmark vertex cover
independent set and clique would be
solvable in exponential time also if we
have this if better function available
the second thing is that in the walls
sort of programming example that we just
had we also saw that the if-better
function is so powerful that it will
allow us to solve vertex cover
independent set and clique in polynomial
time if we have the if better function
available and of course this one down
here that unfortunately has to stay
blank but not because we're sure that
these problems vertex cover independent
set and clique don't have a polynomial
time algorithm but simply because we
don't really know yet we will come back
to this matrix picture here in a minute
but let's turn our attention back to the
RAM machine for a moment now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
