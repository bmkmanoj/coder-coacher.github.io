little bit of time comparing Epsilon
photography and coded photography the
aim so far I've set for the concept of
coded photography is to encode into a
single image information about the
environment the photographic signal from
the environment and then we can add a
post capture after we've captured the
image decoded to actually got more
information about the scene we saw this
example a little bit when we did light
field cameras right it captured a stack
of pictures into one image
representation and then we were able to
do things like parallax and also change
a focal lens so coated photography
basically is aimed at that kind of a
process where we basically encode into
the image itself additional information
that would allow us to extract more
kinds of images out of it at a later
point something that could actually
capture depth parallax even focal planes
and perhaps additional information
Epsilon photography basically says
rather than capture one image with all
of that information let's capture a
series of images a sequence of images a
sequential set of images that may have
those different variations take a
picture change the focal length take
another picture that basically means for
example if there was a fast-moving
object we would actually have trouble
because we'd really like to have a much
faster camera in the case of coda
photography since it's doing all of that
and if it's fast enough in computing all
of this we can actually capture the
image in one go so that's basically one
of the big differences here now of
course the space that goes from coded
photography and epsilon photography
couldn't be merged because we can
actually combine them to be able to
generate normal forms of images too so
one thing to note about coded
photography is each image that we may
capture on a coded photography signal
would basically mean that the
neighborhood pixels may have different
variations one pixel would have focal
lengths at something the other one next
to it may actually have it a different
one and knowing the code that relates
both of them and knowing one pixel at
the left or the right was captured we
can actually decode it to generate
something new and interesting again an
example that comes - something I
mentioned before bear patterns but
knowing the pattern that this one is are
this one is G and this one is B and a
square turn allowed us to decode the
image
in epsilon photography of course that
variation is in time now all of this
allows us to now of course create new
images that can control light over time
or space because now we can capture
series of images or smun image that
actually has those variations either in
space or in time and we can preserve
details about the recorded environment
so in essence what I'm trying to get to
is that there's this big space that we
could actually have between coated
photography and epsilon photography both
of them unusable and they actually may
even overlap a little bit in terms of
what they can do these are just labels
that we're coming up to help us kind of
define the space of different types of
photography's concepts that are related
to computational photography they may of
course have both overlap between both of
them and again at the end of the day
we're trying to figure out how to
capture the best possible way of
capturing an image that we can actually
render differently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
