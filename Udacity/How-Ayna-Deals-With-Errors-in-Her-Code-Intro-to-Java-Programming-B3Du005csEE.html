the first thing I do is likely look at
the screen and say darn it why isn't
this perfect but I move forward and the
second thing I do is tell myself hey you
can fix this
you built this code you wrote this you
know where you can find the problem so I
usually try to comment out certain areas
of code or build use cases for to try to
narrow it down and then solve the issue
within that one part of the code the
third thing I do is I usually get really
frustrated by that point two or three
hours later and I say I can't do this
anymore where do I go so I'll try to
look at some documentation or I try to
look at some tips and I specifically go
and ask some friends for help the fourth
thing that I do is usually I probably
solve it by then so I give myself a pat
on the back and say hey you can do it
this is awesome and I learned something
and I write it down I take a mental note
of it so that next time I don't make
that same mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
