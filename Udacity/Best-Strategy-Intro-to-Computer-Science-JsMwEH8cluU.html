favorite ordering is we're going to
first write a stub days in months that
will take a year in a month and return
always 30 it's really not correct then
we'll modify our next day routine to use
that stub and then right away we'll test
it at this point we won't have done
anything that will actually change the
outputs from what we were getting before
if things are correct but we're now
restructure the code in a way that all
we have to do is improve days and month
and then we've got the correct answer
the next thing we'll do is modify days
in month to be correct except for leap
years I'm putting off leap years as long
as I can because I think leap years are
really annoying but they're also a
complexity that only comes up
occasionally and we can't really close
to a correct answer and know that we've
got all the structure for the code and
everything in good place putting that
off so I'll do that then I think it's a
good idea to test again so we're gonna
do the testing again in step 5 and it
would have been perfectly okay to do the
testing using days and month I think
it's easier to do it using next day
since I can just keep rerunning the same
test that I did first step 3 now I've
got to the point where I really can't
put off leap years any longer so I'm
gonna do the leap years next and I'll
write a helper procedure is leap year as
step 6 and I want to test that
separately that's another step that you
could argue well I could test that using
days and month or using next day in this
case is leap year there enough special
cases that it makes more sense to test
that separately to me and after I've
done that I should have a fully correct
solution I could test it separately but
I'm pretty confident in the rest of my
code at this point I'm gonna jump right
ahead to step K and run all the test
cases so this is the order I'd recommend
but there's plenty of other orders that
make sense one thing that would
certainly make sense would be to move
the leap year stuff to the beginning if
you like leap years and don't want to
put that off easy to do that separately
first the other thing that could happen
is instead of using the next day test
use the days in month test that would be
perfectly reasonable as well so there
are lots of correct answers to this
question the property that they should
all have all the correct answers is that
you're writing small bits of code that
you can test independently as you go you
don't want to be writing a lot of code
and not being able to test it that's one
of the most important things to learn as
a developer is to think of ways to
structure your code to organize the way
you
so you're able to do meaningful tests as
you go and see the code incrementally
get closer to the solution that you need
for the end as you get more confident as
a programmer you might skip some of
these steps but part of my motivation in
asking this question is when I tried to
solve this problem myself I had a bug in
my solution because I didn't do these
steps carefully enough and I tried
running all the test cases and they all
failed and debugging it took a lot
longer than if I'd followed this pattern
what I'm gonna encourage you to do as
you develop your solution is to write
code to run all these tests as part of
your solution and what I hope will
happen if you do these steps testing as
you go when you finally get to step K
and run in on all the test cases it will
magically all work correctly the first
time except it won't be magic it'll be
the result of building things in a
systematic and careful way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
