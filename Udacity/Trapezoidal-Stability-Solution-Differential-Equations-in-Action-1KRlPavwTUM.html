for the time step are okay no matter how
high this is similar to the backward
Euler method and now we're going to look
into why that is the case the
trapezoidal rule turns this differential
equation into the following the next
value of x equals the current value of x
plus the time step times the average of
two rates of change the current rate of
change minus K x1 and the next rate of
change minus K x2 I bring the X 2 to the
left hand side and combine this x1 with
that X 1 and get 1 plus HK over 2 times
x2 equals 1 minus HK over 2 times x1
let's check that one x2 appears here H K
over 2 x2 appears on the right hand side
with a minus sign 1 x1 appears here
minus HK over 2 X 1 minus HK over 2 X 1
appears here correct and that's easy to
solve for x2 x2 equals 1 minus HK over 2
divided by 1 plus HK over 2 times x1 if
you look at what happens with the next
step we of course get a second factor of
that sort the next next step another
factor of that sort so what happens is
that we get powers of this factor the
question is what's going to happen about
powers of that factor so we see that to
get from x1 to x2 we have to multiply by
this vector and this is going to occur
every step if we want to go from X 2 to
X 3 we get multiplied by that vector and
so on so in the end we get powers of
this vector so the question is us the
nth power of this expression converge to
0 as n tends to infinity to check that
one can analyze three different cases
let's first check what happens if the
step size is moderate for instance of
this expression H K over 2 equals 0.1
then we get 1 minus 0.1 over 1 plus 0.1
meaning 0.9 divided by 1.1 this is a
positive number less than 1
if you take higher and higher powers of
that this number is going to become zero
the numerator becomes 0.9 the
denominator becomes 1.1 the fraction is
a number between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and if we take
higher and higher powers of such a
number the results converge to 0 so this
is stable so in this case we have
stability if HK over 2 happens to be
equal to 1 we get a fraction with a 0
and the numerator that's always 0 no
problem with that so we have stability
in that case and if you use a really
high value of H for instance such that H
K over 2 equals 9 we get something like
1 minus 9 equals minus 8 divided by 1
plus 9 equals 10 this is a negative
number but absolute value less than 1 so
if we take higher and higher powers the
result converges to 0 we also have
stability in this case but you see that
this convergence comes along with an
oscillation the sign changes from minus
2 plus 2 minus 2 plus as we form even
powers and odd powers the result has a
positive sign for odd powers the result
has a negative sign so we see some kind
of decaying oscillation here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
