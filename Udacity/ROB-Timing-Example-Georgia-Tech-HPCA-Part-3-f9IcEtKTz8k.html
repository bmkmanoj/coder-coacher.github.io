example of how the Rob based processor
works let's look at a Rob timing example
so this is how we can figure out what
happens when without actually tracking
everything like in the previous very
busy video here we have some
instructions here we have what the
latencies of various units are and now
we're just gonna track when instructions
are issued when they begin executing
when do they write the result
broadcasted and when do they commit and
here we will put some comments that kind
of you know help us tell what happened
when and why this time let's make it a
bit different from before first our
processor will three a reservation
station when the result is broadcast not
when we actually dispatch the
instruction this can happen for example
because the processor is doing something
speculative and it wants to keep the
instruction until it's really sure that
you know the instructions should have
executed so some of the processors
actually do this so let's try an example
with this the processor can still issue
capture a result and dispatch the
instruction in the same cycle but the
execution will again happen in the
following cycle this is just like the
previous processors and again we have
the odd take one cycle multiplication
takes ten cycles and divide takes 40
cycles so let's see well in cycle one we
will try to issue the first instruction
and nothing else can happen because we
don't have any other instructions in the
processor this instruction of course
being the first one we know that it
doesn't depend on anything so it will
begin executing in the second cycle
it's a divided instruction takes 40
cycles to do it so 40 cycles after this
one
we will try to write the result and that
happens in cycle 42 and commit will
happen in the following cycle because
this is the very first instruction so we
can just say 43 here now let's go to
this multiplication once we have some
instructions in the processor we have to
start worrying about reservation
stations and not OB entries and so on
and we haven't said how many are OB
entries we have but let's say we have a
lot of our OB entries however we still
have to divide multiply reservation
stations and three add subtract
reservation station so now one of our
reservation stations for divide and
supply is busy between cycles 1 and 42
there is however another one so this
multiplication can be issued in the
following cycle so it will issue in
cycle 2 when can it execute well it uses
r5 and r6 this doesn't use our 3 so it
can actually execute in the very
following cycle so we will start
executing it here takes 10 cycles so we
will broadcast the result in cycle 13
and when will we commit well we cannot
commit in cycle 14 now we have to wait
for both the previous instruction to
commit and for us to have a result so
really we will commit in cycle 44 now
let's look at this ad here it's using r7
and r8 so it will be executing right
after it issues we have add and subtract
reservation stations remember we have
three separate reservation stations for
that so we will issue in cycle three
start execution in cycle four takes only
one cycle so we will write the result in
cycle five and now when do we commit
this instruction in cycle 45 now things
become a little bit more interesting
because this multiplication wants to
issue in cycle four remember we are
issuing instructions in order we have
reached this instruction in cycle four
we want to issue it however we need a
multiplication and divided reservation
station for that and with free
reservation stations when we broadcast
not when we dispatch in this processor
so we already have seen cycle to both of
the reservation stations used the first
available one will become at cycle 13 so
basically only cycle 14 we can actually
issue this instruction so this
instruction was waiting to issue but
couldn't because there was no free
reservation station so let's kind of
note this so this is just kind of to
note that basically we have been delayed
in our issue because of the needing the
reservation station we are using results
of r1 and r3 so we have to wait for the
multiplication and add before we can
execute but those results have been
broadcast in cycles 13 and 5 so in cycle
15 which is when we can try to execute
we can
if we manage to issue in cycle four we
would still had to wait until cycle 14
here because of cycle 13 here so pretty
much our result would be broadcast in
cycle 13 we would be able to dispatch on
line 13 we would be executing in 14
because we also needed to wait for a
reservation station
we couldn't issue until cycle 14 so we
can only execute in cycle 15 it's a
multiplication instruction so it's gonna
try to broadcast the result in cycle 25
and we will be able to commit it in
cycle 46 now let's look at the subtract
instruction it is gonna try to issue in
cycle 15 we have to issue in order so
although we could have issued this
instruction in cycle 4 as far as you
know dependencies are concerned because
we could have issued this instruction in
cycle 3 4 5 if everything was ok and
there was a free reservation station at
the time here but remember we have to
issue instructions in order because of
that this will issue in cycle 15 and we
will now grab another reservation
station in the add subtract thing so now
what happens is we need to figure out
when do we execute we need R 1 and R 5
the R 1 comes from this multiplication
the R 5 is already available because
none of them are producing it the R 1
here becomes available after this result
is written so in cycle 25 we grab the
value we need and then in cycle 26 we
begin executing it's a subtract it's
going to finish integrals in cycle 27
and it's going to commit in cycle 47 not
because of this but because of this and
finally let's look at this add here it's
going to issue in cycle 16 execution
will begin when R 4 and R 2 are
available our 4 is available in cycle 27
but R 2 is available only in cycle 42 so
we will dispatch in cycle 42 and begin
executing in cycle 43 we will write a
result one cycle after that and we will
commit in cycle 48 and that concludes
our discussion now here you want to make
a note for example that the issue has
been delayed because of reservation
stations and for these instructions
for example here you may want to know
that the execution has been delayed
because of our - just so that if you on
an exam or something if you slightly
mess this up if you made these notes at
least whoever is grading this would be
able to follow you know what went wrong
and you know what was your real mistake
and what was just a consequence of that
mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
