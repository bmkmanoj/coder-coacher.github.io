button on the remote control while
playing back media on the Left we see
something called a now playing card and
is useful for keeping media playing in
the background while the user navigates
elsewhere on their TV notice that the
now playing card appears front and
center right here in the recommendations
row and if the user would like to jump
back into your content they can simply
select it for the now playing card to
work you must use a media session to
play your media we've already seen how
the media session worked earlier in the
android auto section of the class here i
am inside the playback activity section
of our sample the now playing card will
appear automatically as soon as you set
the media session to active so this is a
feature you get nearly for free there's
just one thing you have to do and that's
to keep the metadata of the currently
playing media item current you can see
how this is done inside the update
metadata method once this is done the
contents of the now playing card will be
updated automatically using this
information so remember to call this
method whenever a new media item is
played and here's a quick tip remember
to release the media session object from
playback stops and that's it you can see
a couple more details in the instructor
