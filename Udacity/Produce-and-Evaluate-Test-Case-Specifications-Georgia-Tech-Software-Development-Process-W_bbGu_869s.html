two steps to consider the first step
corresponds to the identification of the
test case specifications in our general
systematic approach and in fact it's
called produce and evaluate test case
specification this is a step that can be
completely automated given the results
of the previous steps and the final
result of this step is the production of
a set of test frames where a test frame
is the specification of a test let me
show you an example of this what we are
looking at here is the test frame for
the program split test frames are
normally identified by a sequence number
so in this case we are looking at the
thirtieth sixth test frame and what they
do is simply to specify the
characteristic of the inputs for that
test in this case since we have two
inputs we have two entries the first one
for string STR tells us that the length
of the string has to be size minus one
and that the string has to contain
special characters and for size it tells
us that the value of size has to be
greater than zero as the title says this
step is meant to produce but also
evaluate test case specification what
does it mean to evaluate one of the
advantages of this approach is that we
can easily use it to assess how many
test frames and therefore how many test
cases we will generate with the current
list of category choices and constraints
and the beauty of this is that if the
number is too large we can just add
additional constraints and reduce it and
given them the step is automated we just
add constraints push a button and we get
our new set of test frames and again we
can evaluate it either go ahead or add
more constraints if we need to further
reduce and this is something else and we
see in our demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
