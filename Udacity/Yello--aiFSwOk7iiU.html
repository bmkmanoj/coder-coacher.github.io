modifies the existing object but you
can't really see the difference from
what we've done with strings where we'll
really see the difference is when we
introduce a new variable so let's go
back to the example we had before and
now we're gonna add an extra assignment
statement and we'll introduce a new
variable
so suppose we introduce the variable Q
and we assign P to Q and that means the
value of P which is the object that's
this list is now what q older 32 so the
important thing here is after the
assignment P and Q refer to the same
list suppose we did an assignment
statement to modify the value of one of
the elements of Q well that will change
element four of Q so this is element
four of Q it will change that value to
the new exclamation point it also
changed the value of P even though the
assignment statement didn't include P
the fact that p and Q refer to the same
object means that it changed the value
of P so to show you that things are
different with strings let's try that
with a string see if you can guess what
happens when we try to use assignment to
replace the first letter in the string
let's run it to see what happens and
what we get is an error and we get an
error because the string is not mutable
there's no way to change the value of
the string and the error says there's no
way to do assignment in a string that
that type of object because it's
immutable does not support assignment so
a key difference between mutable objects
and immutable objects is once an object
is mutable then we have to worry about
other variables that might refer to the
same object we can change the value of
that object and it affects not just the
variable that we think we changed it
affects the value of other variables as
well so let's see an example of that
so I've initialized P to the list
containing the strings hello now I have
an assignment that introduces a new
variable Q and assigns P to that
variable and we'll print out
the values of P and Q and we'll see that
both P and Q contain the string hello
but now let's change the value at
position zero so now we have an
assignment that stores in the value at
position zero of P the letter Y this
changes the value of P what may be more
surprising is this also changes the
value of Q even though we didn't use Q
in the assignment it changed the value
of Q because Q refers to the same object
as P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
