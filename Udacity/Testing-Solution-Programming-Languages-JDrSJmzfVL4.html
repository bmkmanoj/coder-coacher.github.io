we get negative 1 negative 1 negative 1
negative 1 but if I fix the bug then i
get 5 negative 18 negative 1 that means
these first two haystack a and haystack
empty show off the bug and the last two
do not the correct answer was first one
this other one on the left but not the
ones on the right you can also reason
through the program qualitatively to get
a handle on this we're only going to see
this difference if last pause is not
equal to this pause remember this was
the bug and this version is correct so
in order to see the bug this post will
have to be different from last boss
which means we will have to have found
the string at least once we find the a
we find the other a so this is a good
example and then in fact you have to
know a bit about Python to know what it
means to try to find the empty string in
something but Python always says the
empty string is present present at
offset 0 it's going to be present at
offset one and offset too just like
epsilon it fits anywhere so there's more
than one a in the string there's more
than one empty string in haystacks so
these are both good test inputs to show
off this bug since there's no Z in
haystack last boss in this boss are both
negative 1 so we can't tell the
difference and since there's no needle
in the empty string last pause in this
boss are both negative 1 so we can't
tell the difference testing is not easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
