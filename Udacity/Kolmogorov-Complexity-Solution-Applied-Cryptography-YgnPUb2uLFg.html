impossible to compute this for an
arbitrary sequence the first answer is
not correct if s is truly random this
would be correct but if s is not truly
random there might be some shorter way
to compute it so this gives the maximum
value of the Kolmogorov complexity of a
sequence s and an example of such a
program would just be this Python
program that would be the program print
+ s that would print out the sequence s
its length would be the length of s plus
the 5 characters for the print plus 1
for this base but that doesn't prove
that there isn't a shorter program that
can produce s the trick in the second
answer is this part this assumes that we
can execute P to completion in order to
do that we would need to solve the
halting problem we need to know that P
will either either never finish or know
how long to wait - keep running P so we
can't actually do this step this might
run forever this loop may never finish
and so we would never learn the result
so that's why this doesn't work this is
not enough to prove that it's impossible
because maybe there's some other way to
do it and I'm not going to go through
how we actually prove that the Camargue
of complexity is uncomputable but i'm
gonna show you a paradox that will give
you a little bit of an idea why that is
and the paradox is known as the berry
paradox what the paradox asks is what is
the smallest natural number and by that
I mean the set of numbers 1 2 3
sometimes you'll design it starting from
zero paradox would work just as well
either way that cannot be described in
eleven words so this seems like a
reasonable question we can define the
set of numbers that cannot be described
in eleven words seems like a perfectly
reasonable description of a set it's
also a case that any set of natural
numbers has a smallest element the
numbers are well ordered so whatever
that set is there must be some smallest
number so that means there should be an
answer this question that there is a
smallest number that cannot be described
in eleven words and I'm gonna describe
it for you here's my description and my
description has one two three ten eleven
words so I just described the smallest
natural number that cannot be described
in eleven words but I've described it in
eleven words
so that suggests that no such number
exists but that contradicts the
properties we had before and that's why
this is a paradox
this isn't certainly not a proof that
the Kolmogorov complexity is undecidable
but it should give you some sense of how
we might prove that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
