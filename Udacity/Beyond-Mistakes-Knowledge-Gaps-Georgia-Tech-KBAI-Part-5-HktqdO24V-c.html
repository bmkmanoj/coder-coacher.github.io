it was an editor in the knowledge or an
added in the reasoning or in the
learning the knowledge for example was
incorrect in some way but the knowledge
can also be incomplete it can be a gap
in knowledge or in reasoning or in
learning a gap in knowledge occurred
when we were doing this exercise and
that explanation based learning in that
particular case the agent had built this
part of the explanation and it also had
this part of the explanation but it
could not connect these two because
there was no knowledge to connect that
an object that has text sides and yet
can limit heat transfer which protect
against heat once the agent detects this
as a knowledge gap then it can set up a
learning goal the learning goal now is
acquires some knowledge that will
connect these two pieces of knowledge
once the agent detects a knowledge gap
it can set up a learning goal the
learning goal now is to be able to
connect these two pieces of explanation
notice that we are seeing how agents can
spawn goals in this particular case the
agent is spawning a learning goal you
may recall that when we did this
exercise in that explanation based
learning the agent went back to its
memory and found a precedent found a
piece of knowledge that enabled to
connect these two parts of the
explanation and so this link was formed
and the agent was then able to complete
his explanation this is an example how
the learning goal was satisfied using
some piece of knowledge in this case the
knowledge came from the memory but the
agent could have potentially also
acquired the knowledge from the external
world for example it may have gone to a
teacher and said I have a learning goal
help me with the knowledge that will
satisfy that learning goal is able to do
spawn learning goals and then find ways
of satisfying or achieving those
learning goals or any goal in journal is
another aspect of metacognition so this
was an example of how metacognition
helps resolve a gap in knowledge now let
us see how it can help resolve gaps in
reasoning or learning to see how
metacognition can help resolve reasoning
gaps let us return to this example of
using means-ends analysis in the blocks
micro world once the agent reaches a
cul-de-sac in the reasoning the agent
could form a reasoning gold and ask
itself how can I help resolve this
cul-de-sac it may then be reminded of
the strategy of problem reduction which
reduces these
goals into several independent goals
then the agent may go about achieving
each goal one at a time thus in this
example the agent set up a new reasoning
goal and it used that reasoning goal to
pick a different strategy and thereby
achieve that reasoning goal note also
that this is one way in which we can
integrate multiple strategies we first
use mean since analysis ran into
cul-de-sac formed a new reasoning goal
used at reasoning goal to put in a
different strategy problem reduction and
then go back to original strategy means
answer notices were achieving each goal
independently</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
