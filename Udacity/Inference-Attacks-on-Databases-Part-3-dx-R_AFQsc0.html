you say you know well the one I just
gave is not that realistic what if
everybody takes the exam at the same
time well that particular tack will not
succeed in that case so we're going to
craft a different kind of an attack
using the same authorized query which
returns the average score on an exam so
let's say in this case we have only one
student with a standing that is junior
because the the course let's say it's a
senior course and one smart junior
student chose to take it or enroll in it
so it's a senior class and we only have
one student who is a junior it's useful
information that we know where is groups
of students okay you may ask for the
average score of male students female
students students are juniors students
are seniors and things like that because
in general you know if there are a lot
of junior students maybe you want to
know how did you perform relative to
your peers who are also juniors so let's
say the query that says you know
standing which also specify the standing
of a student but it's still asking for
average score let's say that's allowed
so here we get average score of students
when the standing was junior so that's
where our query says we're standing
equals junior in that case we're still
running the average score query so it
will take the tuples where the standing
a junior and then compute the average on
those and return that value well that's
a problem if it does do that because in
this case the query is actually going to
disclose the average if you doing
average for one value then you are
actually the stablished discloses the
value itself so this query if there's
only one student of course the result
it's going to return it's going to be
the score of the student who had junior
standing so this is another example
where I think that the reason and this
happens is that we're computing the
average which is an aggregate which is
authorized as we said before over a
small set of tuples or the exam score
values and tuples are selected in
extreme case there's only one of these
tuples and in that case it's the exact
score so this query again allows someone
to make an inference saying the student
whose
turning a junior this the average that
we get is his or her score</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
