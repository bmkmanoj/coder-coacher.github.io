pivot point for the body and head to be
around the crossbar think back to the
inner Don transforms we saw how the
snowman's arms could go to the wrong
place with a bad order of transforms if
we translated then rotated the arms
would swing wildly in their position
similar to the drinking bird however
it's a bit trickier than that the bird's
body and head are in the correct spots
so where would we translate them to
think about it this way say we
constructed the bird a bit differently
instead of moving the body and head to
their final location what if we moved
them so that the center of the crossbar
was at the origin then the body and hat
would be at the right location for
rotating around the crossbar we can then
put both parts into an object 3d such as
the body head object and apply the
rotation to this parent we could then
move the parent to the proper location
after performing the rotation your job
is to modify the create drinking bird
method so that the pivot is set
correctly I've given you a variable
pivot height which is the height of the
cross bar above the origin I'll also
give you a hint it should take about
three lines of code inside just this
method to set the pivot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
