is that instead of looking at all
possible paths by using recursion we can
look at N squared T paths and remember
the reason we can do this recursion is
that that that recursive form formula
only looks back at the previous state
we're taking advantage of that Markovian
property and with just the forward
algorithm we could evaluate the
probability of seeing that entire
observation sequence given the machine
so for example and I haven't yet told
you how to do this if we had trained up
a bunch of hmm
and some new observations sequence comes
in I could have told you which one was
most likely using just the recursive
just the forward recursive algorithm
right it requires the A's and the B's
but that's what it means to have trained
up the HM n so I want to tell you about
the rest of the problems but I'm just
gonna tell it to you in words I'm not
gonna give you the math and you can go
look they're a bunch of tutorials on hmm
s out there if you want to do the math
they're pretty straightforward
alright so the forward recursive
algorithm that I just showed you can
compute the likelihood of being in state
I at time T and having seen all the
observations up to time T given that you
have the hmm lambda you can similarly
define a backward algorithm alright just
sort of starts from the back and goes
backwards instead of the front and it's
a recursive algorithm that computes the
likelihood of being at state time T and
seeing the remainder of the observations
again given the the hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
