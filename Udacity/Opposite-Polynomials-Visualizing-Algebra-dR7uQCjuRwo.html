opposite polynomials for two polynomial
expressions to be opposite every
corresponding pair of terms must be
opposite in sign we know addition is
commutative so we can rewrite these
terms by adding the opposite I'll move
the negative x squared to the front the
three exes in the middle and the
negative eight to the end notice that
when we move these terms around we just
keep the sign with it the 3x is still
positive the eight is still negative and
the x squared is also still negative now
we can definitely see that these two
polynomials are opposites the x squared
terms are opposites since when is
positive and the others negative the
three X's are opposites since one is
negative and the other is positive and
the eights are opposites since the first
one is positive and the second one is
negative and the neat part about
opposite polynomials and rational
expressions is that they simplify to
negative one we can think about
factoring a negative one from each of
these terms so we'll have negative 1
times the opposite sign of all the terms
in our denominator the numerator will
just say the same and we can think about
multiplying it by a positive one here we
have a common factor in the numerator
and the denominator so this all equals
one and finally since we have this
negative sign down the denominator our
answer simplifies to negative one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
