what we just saw was exactly an example
of this general outline that I showed
you so C Smith was the random test case
generator it was given seeds by a driver
script the driver script ran the tools
in a loop and the Oracle in this case
was just simply looking for compiler
crashes so it wasn't even running the
compiler outfit of course when a
compiler runs it generates code we
weren't even running that code or even
looking at it all we were doing is
waiting for the compiler to tell us that
it failed and the reason the compiler
could tell us that it failed is because
the compiler developers had conveniently
included lots of assertion violations if
those compiler developers hadn't
included all of those assertions then
his compilers wouldn't have failed in
such an obvious way but they still had
encountered bugs and they probably would
have failed in different ways later and
they might have failed in the worst
possible way which is where the compiler
generates code and that code actually
executes improperly a runtime and that's
bad because we as compiler consumers
don't want the compiler giving us wrong
code so while those assertions are can
be annoying as compiler users because
the compiler crash is actually very good
and we want them to be there so the
driver scripts are then checking the
output saving the test cases or in this
case the seed in a log file and they go
back and do it again and so if you
remember in about two days of testing
time this loop it executed about 150,000
times on a fast eight core machine and
of course we're testing simpler systems
and compilers we might have executed a
much larger number of tests than that
and if we're executing very slow
software under test then we might have
only excuse my learn umber of iterations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
