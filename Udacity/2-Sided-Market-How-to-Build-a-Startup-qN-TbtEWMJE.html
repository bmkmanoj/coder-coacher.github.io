model canvas in general now that we've
talked about customer segments is
understanding that sometimes you have
multiple customers multiple segments and
it's kind of interesting to take a look
at Google as an example so let's just
take a look at Google search now let's
just think about you know who's the
customer for Google search is anyone
searching on the web or mobile and the
product we have is a free search bar or
free web mobile app and you know what
are the key resources
well they need software and software
developers and installed user base but
the key idea is this product is free and
if you think about the cost structure
for this it requires massive data
centers and software development and key
activities or data center scale and
speed but the key ideas the revenue
model is free but Google and Google
search is one of the most profitable
businesses on the face of the earth well
how can Google do that well think about
it what we've just been doing is Google
has been acquiring users but someone
else is paying for this product and that
someone else is a different customer
segments called advertisers so we had
users here but we now have payers here
now what's really interesting is for
every customer segment we have a value
proposition we had a free search bar for
the users but for the advertisers we
have a completely different product we
have Google Adwords and our customer
relationships are different for users it
was kind of an automated process you
just basically went to the Google
website or you downloaded a Google
toolbar but for payers it might be
automated but they also have
telemarketing and direct sales to go
after big advertisers but their
distribution channel in addition to be
automated is also self-service and
direct sales but the key thing to note
is that not only do they have different
segments and different value problems
and different customer relationships
more importantly they have a different
revenue model it's a big idea
multiple customer segments require
multiple value props multiple customer
relationships sometimes different
channels but always different revenue
models these are the payers so Google
search is it what we call a two-sided
market there are users and there are
payers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
