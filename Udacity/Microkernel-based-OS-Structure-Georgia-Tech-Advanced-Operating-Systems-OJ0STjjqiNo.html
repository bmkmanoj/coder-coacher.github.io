opportunity for customization is what
spurred operating system designers to
think of a structure of the operating
system that would allow customization of
the services and gave birth to the idea
of microkernel based operating system as
before each of the applications is in
its own Hardware address space the
microkernel runs in a privileged mode of
the architecture and provides simple
abstractions such as threads address
space and inter process communication in
other words small number of mechanisms
are supported by the microkernel the key
word is mechanisms there are no policies
ingrained in the microkernel only
mechanisms for accessing Hardware
resources the operating system services
such as virtual memory management CPU
scheduling file system and so on they
are implemented as servers on top of the
microkernel so in other words these
system services execute the same
privilege as the applications themselves
each of the system service is in its own
address space and it is protected from
one another and protected from the
application and the microkernel being
below the red line is running and
privileged mode it is protected from all
of the applications as well as the
system services so in other words we no
longer have that monolithic structure
that we had before instead each
operating system service is in its own
Hardware address space in principle
there is no distinction between regular
applications and the system services
that are executing a server processes on
top of the microkernel thus we have very
strong protection among the applications
between the applications and system
services among the system services and
between application system services and
the microkernel now the structure what
it entail
is that you need the microkernel to
provide inter process communication so
that the applications can request system
services by contacting these servers and
the servers need to talk to one another
as well and in order for them to talk to
one another they need inter process
communication as well so what have we
gained by the structure what we have
gained by the structure is extensibility
because these OS services are
implemented as service processes we can
have replicated server processes with
different characteristics for instance
this application may choose to use this
particular file system and other
application may choose to use a
different file system no longer do we
have that one-size-fits-all
characterization of the monolithic
kernel and this is the biggest draw for
the microkernel based design that it is
easy to extend the services that are
provided by the operating system to
customize the services depending on the
needs of the application this all sounds
good but is there a catch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
