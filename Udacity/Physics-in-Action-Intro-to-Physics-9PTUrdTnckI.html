the forum that was a call to action he
wants to see examples of physics in real
life specifically simple harmonic motion
so I came to the park knowing that since
simple harmonic motion is everywhere I
find some example here and here i am in
a tree turns out that when you displace
a tree branch just slightly from
equilibrium and release it the resulting
motion is simple harmonic motion don't
believe me I can prove it to you so
we've talked about simple harmonic
motion we've talked about masses on
Springs and we've talked about pendulums
both of these when displaced from their
equilibrium will exhibit simple harmonic
motion and if we think back to why they
display simple harmonic motion we
remember that has something to do with
some restoring force being proportional
to a displacement so for example for the
mass on the spring the restoring force
was equal to minus K times X the K was
just a spring constant X was it the
displacement from equilibrium and the
minus sign while the minus sign was very
essential the minus sign told us that
the force was always opposite the
displacement so tends to restore the
mass to its equilibrium now this is
thinking in terms of force what about
potential energy well for a spring the
potential energy was equal to one-half k
times the displacement squared and it's
this term the displacement squared that
I want to talk about because we see that
if we plot this potential energy versus
displacement we get this lovely parabola
anything that has a parabolic potential
energy curve when plotted against some
sort of displacement will exhibit simple
harmonic motion when it's displaced away
from this equilibrium point so if we can
somehow show that a branch fluttering
back and forth somehow exhibits this
potential energy curve well we're done
we've proven that it must be simple
harmonic motion let's see if we can do
that well let's think what could the
potential energy versus displacement
look like for a branch and here when I
say displacement let's say positive x
means the branch has been lifted up a
little bit and negative means it's been
pulled down a little well to tell you
the truth I have no idea what this curve
looks like I know that it's hard to bend
a branch so potential energy must
somehow go
as I increased displacement in fact in
either direction but then what does it
do maybe there's some sort of plateau in
the energy curve the interpretation here
would be once we reach a certain
displacement it's not any harder to
continue displacing the branch to
continue pulling it further and further
up I don't think this is the case real
branches don't behave like that maybe
instead it actually gets really really
difficult to continue bending the branch
or maybe it's somewhere in between of
course these should all be mirrored on
this side the fact is we just don't know
the only way we could figure this out
since branches are so complicated is by
doing an experiment but I'm going to
make the claim that we don't need to
because for small displacements look
what we have here and it can be proven
mathematically in a very rigorous way
that for small displacements this trough
must has to be a parabola so for this
region in here potential energy is equal
to something times displacement squared
and I don't really care what that
something is and in fact what we've
shown here is actually a deep truth of
reality anything with some equilibrium
position whether it's a branch or a ball
in a well or a mass on a spring for
small displacements will with absolute
certainty undergo simple harmonic motion
so an oscillating tree branch that's my
example of physics in action what's
