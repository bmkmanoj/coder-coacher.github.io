thing I did was say okay well it looks
like this is directly in the middle of
this building to spire so I can draw
some imaginary line making this distance
25 meters now you could have used
trigonometry to solve this question but
there was a trick you could have solved
it in a slightly easier way by using
similar triangles to use the similar
triangle method we notice that this
triangle in purple is similar to this
triangle in green now what are the
dimensions of the screen triangle well
it's 60 meters along the base from here
and 15 meters here simply because this
this height is 60 and we subtract the 45
what about the purple triangle well the
base is 180 meters 60 plus 35 + 60 Plus
this 25 and the height is unknown this
is what we're solving for I'm going to
erase our man to give ourselves some
room and we can set up a ratio the ratio
of this side to that side must be the
same as X 2 180 we multiply both sides
by 180 to solve for x when we do at the
arithmetic we find x equals 45 meters
but we also have to add in the original
45 meters to get the full height of the
Duomo and the answer is at the height of
the Duomo is 90 meters very good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
