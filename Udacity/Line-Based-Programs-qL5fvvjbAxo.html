time and cow say that do something and
then immediately return you to the shell
prompt but not all programs do that some
programs are a little bit more
interactive they took over the terminal
for as long as they're running and then
you get the shell back when the program
exits take for instance ping ping lets
you test whether another machine on the
internet is alive and how long it takes
to send a message to that machine and
back let's say you ping 888 which is
Google's public dns server very fast and
well-connected so we should always be
able to get to it ping starts and it
prints out a line for each successful
echo but it doesn't stop on its own and
give you your shell back instead you
have to tell it to stop one of the most
common ways to tell a program like this
to stop is to type ctrl C which sends
the interrupt signal when you do that
ping stops prints out a summary and you
get your shell prompt back but some
programs have a different behavior
there's a really common design in Linux
programs where a program will read from
what's called standard input or stdin
and right to what's called standard
output or STD out this allows programs
to be chained together under a pipeline
which is a little bit beyond the scope
of this course but when you run a
program like this from the terminal
it'll read from your keyboard input and
write back to the terminal screen and
very often when your input is done you
want to send it an end-of-file character
would you do by typing control D here's
an example the sort program which sorts
lines in alphabetical order if you run
sort and then type or paste in some text
it will print those lines out sorted but
it can't do any sorting until it's
received the last line and that's what
typing control D tells it you have to
use ctrl D instead of control see if you
want the sorted output control C will
just cause it to exit but there we go
there are the four lines that i typed in
sorted programs like sort are called
line based programs because they read
input one line at a time until they
reach the end of the input you can
usually use them on files as well as on
text you type in our paste into the
terminal you'll see a few more of them
later in the course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
