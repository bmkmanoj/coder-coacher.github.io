going to talk about in this unit let's
go back to the Marvel data again so
here's three superheroes we're going to
call them black widow spider man and the
hulk remember that they are connected in
the graph and the original graph by an
edge if the comic book character is in a
particular comic book so there's a set
of comic book characters and a set of
comic books and we add links like so
depending on which comic book characters
are in which comic books now we're often
interested in connections between the
individual characters so up till now we
said that there's an edge linking say
Black Widow and spider-man if and only
if there exists comic book touch that
Black Widow and spider-man both appear
in that comic book in the original data
set so there's really two different
graphs that we're working with here
there's the graph between comic book
characters and then there's the
bipartite graph between comic book
characters and comic books now this edge
appeared you know as long as there was
at least one book they had in common
even if that book had a zillion comic
book characters in it and it was the
only book that they were in together as
opposed to let's say it's like Batman
and Robin which is probably not
mooreville but anyway two comic book
characters that appear together very
often they would also just get a link
between them and that doesn't seem quite
right what we'd like to do is put a
weight on this edge where the weight
equals the number of books they Co
appear in all right so what you need to
do is compute connection strength write
a Python program to read the marble
graph and put a strength value on each
link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
