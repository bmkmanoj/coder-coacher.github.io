recommend that Alice run both algorithms
because both algorithms if you look at
them are very simple so they can be
implemented to run very fast even if the
input graph is very large so she can
first for example run the take 2
algorithm and then she already has a
solution for which she has a guarantee
so running the take 2 algorithm will
give her some information about an
optimum solution and that is the optimum
solution cannot be smaller than some
quantity X and if she then runs the
greedy algorithm she can just see if the
greedy algorithm gives her a solution
that is better than the take 2 algorithm
in this case she should take the greedy
solution or if it produces a vers
solution so if by some accident she's
running it on a graph that has the same
properties than the one that we just
constructed to trick the algorithm then
she can take this solution and in this
way she gets the best of both algorithms
she gets the good performance or the
generally good performance of this
algorithm but she ensures that she is
within certain guarantees the important
thing here to keep in mind is just
because an approximation algorithm
sounds like it makes sense or sounds
like it is a good idea doesn't really
mean that it is a good idea it could be
a good idea but unless you analyze the
algorithms and try to prove their
properties you never know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
