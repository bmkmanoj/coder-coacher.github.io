produce a UML analysis model of those
requirements in particular let's come up
with a particular class called the
account class and you can make some
assumptions you can assume that all the
deposits and withdrawals are made in
amounts that are positive integer number
of dollars and you also do not need to
include an attribute for the current
bank balance we will add that as a
refinement later recall that a class
description in UML has a rectangle with
three boxes the top box is the name of
the class here we're going to call it a
count the middle box has any attributes
of that class and here the attribute
that makes sense is some history of the
users transactions the the withdrawals
and deposits I call that particular
attribute transactions and I'm treating
it as a sequence of integers because we
already assumed that all the deposits
and withdrawals are in in integers the
class also has three operations
corresponding to the requirements one is
deposits that takes an integer value and
doesn't return anything second is a
withdrawal which takes a integer value
and doesn't return anything and the
third is the query asking for the
balance which doesn't take any arguments
but returns an integer value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
