these results for these two extremes so
we had this one extreme where we bet all
thousand chips on a single coin flip and
another where we bet one chip on each of
a thousand coin flips now the risk
adjusted reward or the Sharpe ratio for
the single bet was 0.63 in other words
if we bet all thousand chips on a single
flip of the coin our Sharpe ratio is
0.63 so let's call this s our single now
the Sharpe ratio if we bet a thousand
times in other words one chip on each of
a thousand tables turns out to be 20 so
it's a relationship between these two of
course 20 is about 40 times bigger than
0.6 three but there's something more
interesting there and it turns out that
it's this so if we take the single bet
case and multiply it by the square root
of a thousand we get the Sharpe ratio of
our multi bet scenario where we bet a
thousand at once so isn't that curious
so it turns out that in general if you
carry this scenario out two more
examples that if you split your bets
evenly across multiple tables this
relationship will hold in other words
the Sharpe ratio for the single bet you
know thousand chips on one table is sort
of our base case and as we spread it out
over more and more tables the Sharpe
ratio improves by the square root of
that number of bets in this relation is
exactly like the fundamental law of
active portfolio management namely our
overall performance is related to the
skill in the case of making a single
pick times the square root of the number
of picks that were able to make so our
coin flip casino has helped to show us
how we can derive an equation like this
for betting which is what buying stocks
really is and to show that you can in
improve things either by having more
skill in the case of coin flips skill is
how biased as the coin in the case of
investing it's how good are you at
predicting the future return of a stock
or you can improve your performance by
increasing your breath
but you only get to improve it by the
square-root of your breath</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
