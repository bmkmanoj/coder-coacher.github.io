well in this case it you know I feel
like I could draw us a kind of extended
city block zone and capture maybe I
don't know five or the points okay let's
do it so let's find our five our five
nearest neighbors so let's see this is
clearly close it's one over here and I'd
say this is close I'd say this one is
close this one's close now the other
blue ones are actually that close and
I'd say that's the next closest one so
here are my little five points that all
seem relatively near so what does that
tell you
well I mean it's it it feels like it
suggests the red is not a bad choice
here hmm it's in a reddish part of town
yeah yeah I get that so so you think
it's pretty fair thing to bet that this
should be red then yeah I mean I think
if you were really asking me seriously I
would I would wonder about that blue
point to the right of the highway and
whether that had any influence oh that's
pretty far away yeah it's not that far
away well in Atlanta once you cross
highways you might as well be an
infinite distance away well so okay but
that's a good point then so I guess I
was interpreting your notion of distance
as being you know like straight-line
distance on the map but maybe that
doesn't make sense for this kind of
neighborhood example hmm no that's a
good point so we've been talking about
distance sort of implicitly but this
notion of distance is actually quite
important so maybe distance is
straight-line distance maybe as a crow
flies maybe it's driving distance maybe
it has to take into account the fact
that when you cross highways in Atlanta
you're typically moving into a
completely different universe these
sorts of things matter yeah so I could
imagine I know like Google Maps distance
right or how many different paths can
you get there and which is the shortest
one giving the traffic there's all kinds
of things like that you could do so so
that's fair that's fair but that just
says that this this distant we have to
be very careful what we mean by distance
and that's okay but let's just say for
the sake of this discussion that these
are the closest points by some
reasonable measure of distance so in
that world would you be happy if you had
to pick a single example a single output
a single label of red blue or green
would you be
be picking red yeah I mean you know not
ecstatic but okay that's fair so I like
this so we we went from just picking our
nearest neighbor to picking our nearest
neighbors and what's a good value you
think we should we should stick to with
neighbors we started with one and that
clearly wasn't good you picked at least
not in all cases and you came up with
five so what do you think what what well
if I wanted to call this algorithm
something anything five nearest
neighbors what you think we should I
call it five seems good I mean I feel
like that's that's got to be universal
then number five yeah well it is in
Atlanta but it might not be Universal
and wherever it is you are well called
the Georgia Tech nearest neighbors that
doesn't seem like an algorithm that's
gonna going to be used very much fair
enough all right so what about we could
do as many nearest neighbors as is
appropriate well maybe we should just
make it a free parameter and call it K
ok I like that K nearest neighbor so
we'll have K nearest neighbors and we'll
pick our cameras oh you said something
fancy there by the way you said free
parameter I like that we should we
should come back to that again so we
have an algorithm K nearest neighbors
which takes K nearest neighbors as a way
of deciding how you're going to label
some query point here and we've
identified two parameters to the
algorithm so far K which is the number
of neighbors we're going to use and some
notion of distance which here we were
kind of using in a sort of obvious way
but there might be other ways we might
want to use distance here yeah like I
could imagine if the houses had
additional features like how many square
footages they had right stuff like that
that would make perfect sense so so
really distance we're using distance
here in a kind of an overloaded sense
because this is something that's on a
map but really distance is a stand-in
for similarity similarity good it's kind
of standard for the opposite of
similarity
well distance is just a kind of
similarity right but in the case of dot
you know points on a map similarity it
sort of makes sense because as you said
with when we're talking my real estate
location location location matters so
their similarity really is kind of the
inverse of distance but in other ways
things like the number of bedrooms you
have whether you're on one side of the
highway the other the school district
here and things like that are other
things we might add as features or
dimensions when we talk about similarity
or distance okay so I like this or I
think we have a general algorithm now
I think it does a pretty good job of
addressing the point you brought up we
no longer have to worry about
overfitting as much at least it seems
that way to me and we have a way of
being a little bit more robust to this
you know not having an exact data point
in the database so maybe we should turn
this into an algorithm yeah let's go for
it okay let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
