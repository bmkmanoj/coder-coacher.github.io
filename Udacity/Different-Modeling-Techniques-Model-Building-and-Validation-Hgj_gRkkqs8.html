modeling techniques but to be able to
build any type of model we will need to
first investigate the data we will be
following the same iterative process of
writing down our questions selecting
features from the data that can best
answer the questions build models to get
some answers and using validation
techniques to determine the model that
best answer the questions although we'll
emphasize the process of model building
we will still keep iterating through the
qmv process and use our diagrams to
track our progress before we dive into a
particular example problem let's look at
various approaches and techniques that
we can use to build models let's look at
some of the modeling techniques in use
one of the first techniques that comes
to mind is mathematical models they are
usually useful in domains such as
natural social or economic sciences the
tools and concepts required to build
mathematical models involve differential
and integral calculus differential
equations algebra and other advanced
mathematics the advantages of
mathematical models is that they can
give generalized knowledge of systems
they also reduce complex phenomenon to
simple cases and we can use inductive
and deductive reasoning to gain
knowledge about our system and the
models another important technique of
model building is statistical or machine
learning they're applicable in industry
in businesses and in general cases where
we don't have domain-specific knowledge
the tools and concepts required for
statistical and machine learning models
is a good knowledge of statistics
machine learning linear algebra and some
information theory the advantage of
these models is that
we can treat phenomenon in all its
complexity and we can make inferences
using computational power in practice we
often use a combination of mathematical
modeling techniques and statistical and
machine learning techniques these are
applicable everywhere in science as we
mentioned social and economic sciences
business engineering as well as
optimization problems all the tools and
concepts listed above can come in very
useful to build these combination models
the advantage is that we can use
whatever model we find necessary and as
per requirement to solve our problems
hopefully this table here gives you a
general idea of where we use what sort
of modeling technique although we are
not going to cover mathematical models
we invite you to go through the tools
and concepts required and approach some
problem with mathematical models if need
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
