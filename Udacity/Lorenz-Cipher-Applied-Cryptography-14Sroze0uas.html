kinds of things that go wrong when
people attempt to use one-time pads in
practice and this is a story that is
very important to the history of
computing as well as the history of the
world and it's how the Allies at
Bletchley Park were able to break the
Lorenz cipher which was a cipher used by
the Nazis to communicate between the
capitals of the cities of Europe
the story goes back at least to the 1919
patent that Gilbert Verne um who was an
engineer working at Bell Labs got on a
one-time pad system shouldn't really be
called a one-time pad it was a reuse pad
system and the idea behind this is
somewhat clear from the patent
especially if we rotate it so you can
see it more clearly so one thing you can
see is that there five wires going into
it and this is the output from reading a
tape that encodes the message the key
was also on a paper tape and the
encoding used just five bits so this was
the video code with five bits we can
encode 32 different symbols so that's
enough for the alphabet and a few
punctuation marks and you can see the
letters were encoded there's the strip
down the middle that was used to align
the tape and then there five bits to
encode each letter managing paper tapes
like this was difficult and the keys
needed to be distributed on paper tapes
if the keys were constructed in a
perfectly random way and you had enough
key that you never need to reuse it well
this would actually be a perfect cipher
if this would be a perfectly good
one-time pad
problem is distributing large paper
tapes is pretty difficult especially if
you're trying to do this in wartime so
the machine that was built based around
the same idea as the old Rennes cipher
machine where instead of having a paper
tape with the key you had a machine that
would attempt to produce a good sequence
of key bits and of course it's
impossible for machine to produce a
perfectly random sequence the structure
of the machine determines properties of
the sequence that's produced so the
machine would generate a key sequence
based on its configuration and that
configuration is the initial settings of
all the rotors and other parameters that
we'll talk about soon if there are two
machines that that start in the same
configuration say one in Berlin and one
in Paris well then they produce the same
key the encryption is just the message
ex-ored with the key that produces the
ciphertext that sent over radio wireless
received at the other end which puts it
in the machine starting with the same
configuration so that means that
ciphertext ex-ored with the key
generated by this machine starting from
the same configuration will decrypt to
receive the message the machine was
designed to produce a large number of
possible sequences there are a lot of
complex operations which we'll talk
about a little next but the key would
not repeat for ten in the nineteen
letters so given that this number was
larger than the amount of text written
by humans at least at the time this led
the Nazis using it to believe that it
provided the highest security they
needed they also were confident that
because these machines operated in
capitals they weren't like the Enigma
machines which operated in the field
that they never lost one of these
machines that the Allies never actually
had access to the actual machine to try
to figure out how it worked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
