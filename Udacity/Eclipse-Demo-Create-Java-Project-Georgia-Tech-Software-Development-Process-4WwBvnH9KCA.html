to look at Eclipse and try to get more
familiar with the clips in a hands-on
manner through a demo in the demo we
will cover some of the basic aspects of
the Clips like how to run Eclipse how to
select a workspace how to create a
project how to create a class within the
project and so on and we'll also cover
some more advanced aspects like how to
create builders run your projects within
Eclipse and how to use the Eclipse
debugger so let's get to the demo so
let's start eclipse the Eclipse is gonna
ask me for the location on my workspace
and in this case I see that I selected a
suitable directory and you can also use
that checkbox on the left to avoid at
least for asking you again about where
to put the workspace and the workspace
is basically the place the directory
where eclipse will place all of your
projects so now when you start eclipse
if it's the first time you might get
this welcome screen it's not gonna
happen again on subsequent executions
but I just wanted to make sure that I
covered all the bases and so what you
want to do here is to basically go to
the Java perspective which you can do by
clicking over there or you can also use
the menus so in this case we will have
to go to window open perspective and if
the perspective is not here you'll have
to click on other and at this point you
can click on Java perspective then you
click OK and the perspective is
basically the visual workspace where you
will be operating so after we selected
perspective we can actually close the
welcome screen and here you see that you
have these different areas in on the
left you have the package Explorer this
is the area where your packages will be
you get a task list and an outline on
the right which we'll cover later and
then you have underneath at the bottom a
problems Java doc in declaration views
and we will see some of these views in
actions later and here in the center you
have the area which is called a code
editor which is where you will be
writing editing and modifying basically
your code this is where most of the
action takes place so let's start by
creating a Java project and to do that
we can either use a context menu or you
can just use the menu select new Java
project you will be greeted by this
wizard and at this point in the whiz
you can select the name of your project
I'm just gonna call it a very simple way
my project then I'm gonna use the
default location for the project as you
can see it will be placed in the
workspace that I selected before I'm
gonna also use the default Java Runtime
environment which is a Java 1.7 in this
case I'm gonna keep the selected default
layout and then I'm gonna go to the next
step here we were first presented with
the location of the source code for our
project
the default is a director the SRC in my
project in for the output file the
directory bean we're not gonna change
that here in case you need other
projects to build your own then you can
specify them here here we are building a
simple project so there's no need for
that and here we can specify which
libraries our project requires as you
can see the Java library is already
specified and you can also add other
jars which can even be external jars and
finally this is the tab that allows you
to specify which parts of your projects
or how your project will be exported so
let's not worry about that for now let's
click finish and as you can see here on
the package Explorer my project appeared
so now we can open the project by
clicking on the triangle right next to
it and as you can see there is the SRC
directory where my source code will go
and there's also an indication that we
are using the JRE so that the Java
system library within our project and
this is just for people who are
interested in what happens you know
under the hood so if you don't care
about that you can just skip this part
so basically here I'm showing you how we
can go to the directory where the
project was created we can see the bin
and SRC directories and there's also
some other files here that you can see
this dot files that you don't normally
see and those are kind of bookkeeping
files so these are files that contain
information about your project and that
are created automatically by eclipse and
for example we'll have various
indication about configuration of the
project some settings and the class path
for the protein and as I said you don't
have to worry about this if you just
want to go eclipse that you're never
gonna mess with the common line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
