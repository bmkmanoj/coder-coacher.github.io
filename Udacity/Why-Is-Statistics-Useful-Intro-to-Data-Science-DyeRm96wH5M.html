science there's a lot of reasons
obviously the the first the first reason
I would say is the most basic one this
goes back to why statistics was you know
developed 100 or so years ago and it
really is to make sure that you're
making reasonable inferences from data
so you hear a lot of people talk about
big data and the value of big data and
how we can you know we have data on just
about everything nowadays and it's easy
to get caught up in that and it's
important to remember that anytime
you're looking at any sort of data
whether it's observational or
experimental you want to make sure that
you're making valid inferences right you
want to do things like check for
statistical significance understand
confidence intervals make sure that
you're not pointing the people you're
working with in in sort of completely
wrong direction because you've you've
sort of over interpreted some data so I
think that's the first probably most
important reason why statistics is
important to data science and there's a
lot more you know beyond that there's a
lot more just working with data day-in
day-out there's a lot of just what I
would call sort of you know very
fine-grained technical skills to just
make sure you're doing the right thing
and you're extracting the most
information you can out of data is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
