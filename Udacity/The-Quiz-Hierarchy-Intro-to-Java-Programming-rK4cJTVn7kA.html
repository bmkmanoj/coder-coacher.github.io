to make a new question here we construct
the question and now we need to set the
question text there's a method for that
and we need to set the desired answer
and there's a method for that really all
you had to do is look up here and
imitate how to set up the first question
in the present question method we first
displayed the question again there is a
method for that to find that out you
actually have to look up the question
class the method is here there's no
other way to show the question text than
to call display the code for reading the
user response was already given to you
now we need to check whether it's the
correct response that's the job of the
check answer method that you also had to
discover by looking at the code of the
question class it gets the users
response and it returns true or false
depending on whether it was correct or
not we were supposed to print either
true or false the simplest way of doing
that is to just print the value of the
boolean variable but of course you could
also print true in this branch and false
in this branch if you prefer so if the
outcome is true we return a score of 1
otherwise a score of 0 let's just run
this program so let's see who was the
inventor of Java everyone knows that or
not and who was the founder of Jude
asset e all I better get that one right
I'll get in trouble now I did this one
right and at least I got a score of 1 so
now you have an idea on how the basic
question class works and we're ready to
refine that class by forming subclasses
of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
