about which cleaning solution brand to
go with he's decided to sell all of the
different products that he's marketing
in a package he's going to sell nozzles
and wipers and cleaning solution for one
fabulous deal taking all the various
costs of creating his products and
shipping them and everything into
account grant calculates that he'll make
a profit of a thousand dollars for every
sixty glasses cleaning sets that he
sells it if he sells 100 glasses
cleaning sets he'll make a profit of
twelve hundred dollars assuming that the
relationship between number of cleaning
sets sold and profit is linear or in
other words lies on a straight line we
should be able to predict how much of a
profit grant will make for any number of
glasses cleaning sets that he might sell
it would be really great if we could
plot this information on a graph and
then use that graph to find out about
other points on the line if we let X
equal the number of cleaning sets that
grant cells and y equal his profit in
dollars can you write each of these
pieces information as a point on the
line that we're going to be able to draw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
