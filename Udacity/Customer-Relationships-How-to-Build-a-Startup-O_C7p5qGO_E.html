customer relationships in other words
how do you get keep and grow customers
so in the last lecture you remember the
business model canvas all the nine
components of a startup we talked about
value proposition and we talked about
customer segments we talked about
channels but today we're going to focus
on customer relationships customer
relationships really is about how do you
get customers how do you keep customers
and how do you grow them here are to get
keep and grow funnels and the one thing
to notice is the one on the top
represents a physical channel and the
one on the bottom is web mobile and the
thing to just remember is a physical
channel as we're going to see later that
the details inside of how you get or
acquire customers are different than how
you would acquire customers and web
mobile just know that the physical
representation of the customer lifecycle
get keep and grow is kind of this
double-barreled funnel and that's why we
draw it this way if it just allows you
to kind of understand how to customers
get into our company how do we get them
how do we keep them and how do we grow
them and so let's look at both of these
get keep and grow for physical and web
mobile channels in a little more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
