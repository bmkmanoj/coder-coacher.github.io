loop through elements of a list just
using while we'd be able to do anything
we want it would just be a little more
complicated than we won so Python
provides a simpler way to loop through
elements of the list and that's called
the for loop so the structure of a for
loop is like this we have the keyword
for followed by a name and this is a new
name for a variable that we can
introduce then the keyword in followed
by a list and this is any expression
which evaluates to a list followed by a
colon so this is quite similar to what
we've seen for the structure of a while
loop and an if statement with a block
inside the for what a for loop like this
means is that for each element in the
list we're going to assign that element
to the name and evaluate the block and
we'll do that in order going through the
list so using for we can define the
procedure print all elements using much
less code than we needed using while we
have a for statement where we'll
introduce the name E as the variable
name we're going through the list P and
for each element what we want to do is
just print that element so let's step
through what happens when we use the for
loop calling print all elements passing
in the list we've defined and stored in
the variable my list this is a list with
three elements the first two are numbers
one and two and the third is the list
three four so when we created my list
that created a list object that looks
like this
it has the three elements numbers in the
first two and the list three four and
the third one when we pass that to print
all elements the variable P will refer
to that object when we execute the loop
what happens is the variable E is
assigned to the first element of P so
initially he will refer to this value we
execute the body of the loop with that
as the value of e so that will print out
the value one then we continue the next
time through the loop you will refer to
the second element of P we evaluate the
body of the loop printing out that value
which is two then we continue in the
loop the next time you will refer to the
third element of P which is the list
three four
we'll print out the list three four at
this point we've gone through all the
elements of P and the for loop is done
execution would continue here in this
case there's no statement there so we're
done executing the procedure and we
return</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
