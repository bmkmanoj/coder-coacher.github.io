Andersons array-based
queuing lock we're going to use a linked
list representation for the queue so the
size of the queue is going to be exactly
equal to the dynamic sharing of the lock
and this particular linked list based
queuing lock algorithm is due to the
authors of the paper that I've
prescribed for you in this reading list
namely malloc rummy and Scott and so
sometimes this particular queueing lock
is also referred to as the MCS luck
so the lock data structure the head of
the queue is a dummy node it is
associated with every lock so every lock
is gonna have this dummy node associated
with it and we'll initialize this dummy
node to indicate there is no lock
requesters presently
for this particular lock so this pointer
is pointing to nil nobody's got the lock
and there are two fields for every queue
node for a requester so every new
requester is going to get this cue node
and in this queue node there are two
fields one field is the guarded field
and guarded is basically a boolean this
which and and it says whether they have
the lock or not if it was true I've got
it if I don't have if it is false I
don't have it yet
and the next field in the queue node is
pointing to my successor in the queue so
if I came in and I requested the lock I
get into the queue and if if a successor
comes along and requests a lock
he gets queued up behind me so that's
this basic data structure every queue
node is associated with a requester the
dummy node that we start with is
representing the lock itself and since
we are implementing a queue fairness is
automatically assured the requesters get
queued up in the order in which they
they make the request and so we have
fairness built into this algorithm just
like the Andersons hairy beast queue
lock as I said before we initialize the
lock to to nil indicating there are no
requests yet and let's say that I come
along and request a lock I don't have to
wait because currently there's nobody in
the queue and therefore it gets a lock
right away and and I can go off into the
critical section and star
executing the critical section code that
is associated with this particular lock
so what I would have done when I came in
to make this lock request is to get this
Q node and make the lock data structure
point to me and I'd also set the next
pointer to Janelle to indicate that
there is nobody after me and once I have
done that I know that I've got the lock
and and I can go off into the critical
section and do whatever I need to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
