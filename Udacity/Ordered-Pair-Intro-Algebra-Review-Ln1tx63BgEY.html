between how much I would work and how
much I wouldn't make can be described
with what's called a linear equation or
the equation of a line in this example
we would use maybe y to represent the
amount of money i'm going to make and it
turns out that this was equal to 10
times x where x is the number of hours
that would work so even though these are
just letters X &amp;amp; Y they represent hours
worked and money made but this is
getting a little cluttered let's use a
chart to organize our thinking and I'm
going to organize my thinking with
what's called a t-chart which looks
something like this and remember my
equation y equals 10x where Y represents
the money I make and X represents the
number of hours worked well we've
already seen that if I work five hours I
make fifty dollars and if I work 10
hours I make a hundred dollars and I
could keep filling this chart out the
interesting thing to note though is that
each row has two numbers in it and for
the purposes of graphing I like to write
these numbers as an ordered pair with
the x value first and then the Y value
notice they're separated by a comma and
they have parenthesis around them so if
5 comma 50 is the ordered pair version
of this information how would you write
this row of information as an ordered
pair I've given you the comma and you
just have to enter in the two numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
