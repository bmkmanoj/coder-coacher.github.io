when you changed all of the pixels from
an image into their negative at the time
I gave you the loop structure to do this
and I told you not to look too closely
at it now we're ready to reveal this
mystery on your left we're going to
start this program we have a for loop
because we want to iterate over all of
the pixels we'll find out soon enough
how many pixels there are the structure
is very similar to the structure of
working with words instead of getting
the ice character we get the ID pixel by
getting the color at position I and we
can also set it presumably after having
changed it in some way so here's your
basic loop get the pixel process it and
put it back now how many pixels do we
have we can ask the picture and it's
going to tell us their number of pixels
and that is the exact analog to the
length of a string except that you
should think of the pixels as being
arranged like this a row of pixels
another row and they all come one after
another when we ask for them and
eventually we reach all the pixels that
way hi starts at zero goes up to the
total pixel count is incremented at
every step we get the I pixel and that
way we get all of the pixels in the
image in our particular example we
simply compute the negative of the color
and then we can put it back finally we
want to load to picture show it to the
user and then start processing it let's
run the code here is Eliza all positive
and here she is sadly negative as you've
seen it's just as easy to work with
pictures as it is to work with words</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
