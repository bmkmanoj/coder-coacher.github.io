and I didn't know that I wasn't seen
very well but what I did know was I
wasn't doing well at school I got my
first pair of glasses and suddenly the
world changed and I could start to see
the board at school I started to do well
in my exams if my situation were
different this may have never happened
and I wanted to make sure that that
wasn't the case for anyone else
Peak vision was on out of a challenge
people who can provide eye care
tend to live in cities and towns and
people who were blind tend to live in
very rural difficult to reach areas
particularly in low-income countries
such as Kenya and so the real vision was
to try and connect the two using mobile
technology initially we moved out to
Kenya to do some research which was
setting up 100 clinics I took a look to
all of the stuff that I was having to
car around in this eye clinic which was
over 150 thousand dollars worth of kit I
thought can we try and transform this
into a technology that's really portable
and accessible so we went about
redesigning every one of the tests that
were in the clinic with either a
smartphone app or a piece of clip-on
hardware that could sit on the
smartphone and allow it to be all
performed on a smartphone by a
technician so without having to have
expert healthcare training using
configuration of lenses and all sorts of
complexities that would make it possible
to hold your smartphone up pointer
someone's eye and get a view of the
retina so we have a suite of peek
applications here I'm going to show you
the vision test so what we do here is it
will give us some on-screen instructions
to stand 2 meters from the patient and
they'll get a letter e to look at
they'll point in the direction of the e
so this way it's going by that so we'd
swipe on the phone accordingly now the
advantage here is the tester doesn't
need to see what's going on on the
screen so they're just going to swipe
whichever way the patient is pointing
even if they're giving the right or
wrong answer if they were to shake their
head and say they can't see we can just
shake the device and that'll record a
not seen and once the test is finished I
get a vibration alert and reading on
screen so what we can do is then view
their world based on that vision test
using our sight sim application which
gives you the detected vision and the
normal vision and it allows you to walk
around that person's visual world and
really understand their level of sight
impairment
the initial builds of this were designed
to be used within the study that I would
had moved to Kenya for but one of the
big things that we learn is if you
create a tool is easy to use this low
cost and is intuitive it's likely to be
adopted in any market we often focus on
impact in terms of economic since it in
the sense of how can I make money or how
can we take money out of this whereas
there's a huge economic value in terms
of giving somebody their site back what
we repeatedly saw in our clinics in
Kenya's would have young children
supporting older parents or grandparents
who should have been in school so for
that child it means they're likely to
never break out of poverty so moving the
measure away from what can I take out of
this - what can I put in and I think is
a real way of actually assessing the
economic impact and there's a huge
number of areas where mobile developers
can add value I think it's almost
limitless in terms of the way we could
improve things and by being able to
contribute to making other people's
lives easier or more efficient and you
can then have a huge knock-on effect on
on hundreds thousands millions of other
people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
