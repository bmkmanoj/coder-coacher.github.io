customer segments is understanding their
pains we've been talking about all the
wonderful stuff that we could do for
them that makes them happy but are the
things that we could get rid of that
actually is kind of like they've been
walking around with an arrow through
their head and they've just kind of
accepted that for a while but when you
come about you could say hey we could
solve these problems for you well let's
see what kind of problems we could solve
is there something your customers find
too costly again is it about time and
cost too much this is essentially the
flip version of the games the pains are
what could we solve for these customers
that they hate is there's something
about their product or service that's
underperforming it's missing features
it's too slow it doesn't work well it's
bugging and what are the main
difficulties and challenges now one of
the interesting things is that
entrepreneurs come back and say yes
customer said this was a real pain our
product really solves these problems
well one of the things you need to know
is was this like problem number 47 on
their list or is this in the top three
because most human beings whether
they're in corporations or even at home
you know tend to like only worry about
the top three or five so when you find
out that this solves a pain the question
you need to ask is in context well what
are the other pains you have and you
really under want to understand their
top ten top 20 and then if to find out
you're number 32 or 47 I wouldn't be
celebrating but I actually would be
asking well wait a minute
is there any way that our product or
service can actually solve anything in
the top 5 and if not maybe you're in the
wrong customer segment and so you want
to understand what's keeping your
customer awake at night or maybe
conversely maybe you want to keep them
awake at night but you want to figure
out what are their big issues concerns
and worries and then finally the last
piece is what are the barriers to adopt
your product as it it cost too much up
front so maybe you have a pricing issue
to decide later gee it takes a long time
to learn or you know we're happy with
what we have and it's kind of okay and
what makes your customers feel bad
frustrations and no
etc and what are they fear financial or
social risks what could go wrong etc you
need to understand all of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
