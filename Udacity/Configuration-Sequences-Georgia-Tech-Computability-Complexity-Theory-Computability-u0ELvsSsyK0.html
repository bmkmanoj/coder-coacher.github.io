starts in the initial state and with its
head over the first position on the tape
as it computes its internal state the
tape contents and the head position will
change but everything else will stay the
same we call this triple of state tape
content in head position a configuration
and any given computation can be thought
of as a sequence of configurations it
starts with the initial state the input
string and with the head on the first
location and it proceeds from there now
it isn't very practical to always draw a
picture like this every time that we
want to refer to a computation of a
Turing machine so we developed some
notation that captures the idea actually
we'll rewind the computation we just did
and do it again this time writing down
the configuration using this notation we
write the start configuration as Q 0 1 0
1 1 the part to the left of this state
represents the tape contents to the left
of the head it's just the empty string
in this case then we have the state of
the machine and then the rest of the
tape contents after the first step a 1
is to the left of the head we're still
in state Q 0 and this is the rest of the
string 0 1 1 0 1 and 1 in the next
configuration 1 0 is to the left of the
head we're still in state Q 0 and 1 1 is
the rest of the tape contents and so on
and so forth this notation is a little
awkward but it's convenient for type
settings it's also very much in the
spirit of Turing machines we're all
structured data must ultimately be
represented as strings if a Turing
machine can handle working with data
like this then so can we
at a slightly higher level a whole
sequence of configurations like this
captures everything that a Turing
machine did on a particular input and so
we will sometimes call such a sequence a
computation and actually this
representation of a computation will be
central as we discussed the cook-levin
theorem in the section on complexity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
