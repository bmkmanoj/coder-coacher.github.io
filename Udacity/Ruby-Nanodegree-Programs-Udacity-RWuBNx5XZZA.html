just knowing how to code it's a total
shift in thinking and skills of
communication collaboration have become
just as valuable to employers there are
tens of thousands of unfilled ruby on
rails developer positions right now when
we at Udacity decided to begin teaching
Ruby and rails we knew we wanted to do
it in a big way that's why I'm super
excited to announce that we've partnered
with industry leaders at github to
create three new nano degree programs
beginning Ruby which is available right
now Ruby on Rails and senior ruby on
rails which will both be available
within the next year whether you've
never seen a line of code in your life
or are already working as a junior
developer we've created entry points for
people at any experience level all three
nano degree programs focus on building
projects for your portfolio's de both
job ready and a lifelong learner you'll
hear from Ruby thought leaders including
the creator of Ruby himself as they
share their exclusive insights and
lessons learned along the way beginning
Ruby will give total newcomers to code
the strong foundation and programming
they'll need to move on to learning ruby
on rails not only will you learn the
Ruby language you'll be working with all
the same tools developers use on a
day-to-day basis like github and
documentation once you've built up
fluency with Ruby will guide you through
the ruby on rails framework used by top
companies such as github Shopify and
group on the solid portfolio of web
applications that you'll build will
leave you job ready for a junior ruby on
rails developer position now here's what
I'm especially excited about the senior
ruby on rails developer nanodegree
program picks up where the Ruby on Rails
program leaves off and is built with
working junior rails developers in mind
it'll give you an opportunity to level
up your skills with advanced topics
meant to set you on track to becoming a
more senior developer I love Ruby and I
can't wait to share that with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
