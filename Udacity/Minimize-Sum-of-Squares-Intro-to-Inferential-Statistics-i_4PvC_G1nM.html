best fit is to find the line that
minimizes the sum of all the residuals
the only problem is that the residuals
are either negative or positive and so
if we had something like this say these
negative and positive residuals would
just balance each other out we could
have a line of best fit that doesn't go
through the points at all but still has
a very small sum of the residuals we're
kind of in the same situation where we
were figuring out how to measure spread
we looked at possibly the average
absolute deviation then from the mean
similarly we could look at the absolute
residual in other words even if the
residuals negative just look at the
positive value this is one method but
the standard method is to minimize the
sum of squared residuals in other words
we'll square all the residuals to get
rid of the negative sign add up all
these squares and then minimize this
value in symbols this would be the
observed Y value minus the expected Y
value which you remember was y hat and
this is the Y value that corresponds to
that x value on this regression line
squared when we have a function we can
use calculus to find the maximum value
and the minimum value when we say value
we mean the x value where does the max
or min occur in other words at what x
value we can also use calculus to
minimize this sum of squared residuals
and find out what our regression
coefficients should be when we use
calculus we get that our slope is equal
to this this is a long tedious equation
and you won't have to use it it just so
happens that this is equal to R remember
Pearson's correlation coefficient times
the ratio of the standard deviation of
the Y values to the standard deviation
of the X values isn't that awesome
let's use it to find the slope of our
in line for the airplane example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
