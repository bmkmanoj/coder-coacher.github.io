reader reviews should be this systematic
and thorough one way to deal with this
need is to explicitly address each part
of the artifact being reviewed for
example in a code review each line
should be individually looked at the
reader is the person responsible for
enforcing this Thurnis by leading the
participants through the artifact and
for each part paraphrasing what what the
artifact is expressing for that part the
paraphrasing should be it should be
descriptive and not try to say why that
particular part is there some
organizations run their reviews with the
artifacts authors being the readers
other organizations make sure that
someone else does the reading I think in
the case of the first type of
organization the thought is that an
author might bias the discussion by
emphasizing certain things the author
felt is important even at the expense of
perhaps hiding some details which need
to be looked at more carefully in either
case the reader should use in personal
pronouns such as it referring to the
artifact rather than referring directly
to the author with I or he or she or
something like that personalizing the
review by using I and and you and and so
on can raise the defensive nasol of the
participants thereby reducing the
reviews effectiveness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
