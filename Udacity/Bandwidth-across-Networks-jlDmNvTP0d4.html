example Network hosts a and B are
attached to fast networks but the link
between them is slow if one of them
tried to send it to the other at the
speed of the local fast Network
they'd congest the link between them the
router would have to drop traffic in
order to get anything through and TCP is
smart enough to do slow start to avoid
congesting intermediate network links
but here's a more realistic example of a
network here we have some servers in a
data center with an internal network
that's very fast a 10 Gigabit Ethernet
and the data center network is attached
to the internet with a link that's
pretty fast to one gigabit and here are
all the users there are really a lot of
users each of whom have internet
connections that are slow by comparison
now the capacity of a network link or of
a multi link path to carry data in terms
of bits per second is its bandwidth and
we can talk about the bandwidth of a
link here but we can also talk about the
bandwidth available from this user to
this server across multiple links now
that's generally going to be the minimum
of the bandwidths of those links if your
server network is very fast that means
that your servers can talk to each other
at the high speed but if your users home
networks are very slow upgrading your
server network will probably not have
any effect on the speed that you users
see this may seem obvious but this
concept of a limiting factor turns out
to be really important in a lot of
server administration situations but if
you have a large number of simultaneous
users each of whom is on a slow Network
all of those slows may add up to more
than a fast
that's one reason server networks are
typically a lot faster than end-user
networks and this has some pretty
significant implications if you know how
much traffic a typical user makes and
you know how many simultaneous users you
have you can tell how fast this
connection needs to be or on the scary
side of things if all of these users
started hitting your service as hard as
they could you could tell how fat this
pipe would have to be in order to hold
up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
