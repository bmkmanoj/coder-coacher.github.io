you have to implement an algorithm for
doing it now we tell you i took this
algorithm from i think their claim
slides there on the web that he took
from somewhere else setter so I don't
know for sure that this algorithm is the
one they use but it sounds pretty good
all right it is it's similar what you
would do so first thing you do is you
project out these dots and you just
detect them so you detect these speckles
and you label all of them as unknown I
don't know their depth now what you
start doing is you randomly select a dot
that's that's labeled as unknown and
then you take this windowed search all
right doing a normalized correlation and
along a scan line that is that really
should say along an epi polar line I
know exactly where to look okay and I
check for the best match and by the way
I have to make sure that that best match
is good enough if that best match is not
so good I mark that dot as invalid and I
start looking for new dots again but if
my first match is really good I start
doing what's called region growing I
start looking around that neighborhood
for matching other points against the
known pattern okay oh yeah by the way
what am I correlating I know the pattern
i'm projecting so I've got my little
local pattern of what's called pseudo
random speckle points and I just
correlate them around and so pixels
nearby are added to a queue for each
pixel i initialize its offset looking
for it from the one I just had I
searched around a little bit see if I
find a good enough match if so I label
it is matched with its offset its
disparity and then I look for its
neighbors and I add them to the queue
and I stop doing that when that queue is
empty because I finished using this
anchor point and I go back again and I
reinitialize pick another point and I
stop when all the points are labeled as
with a known depth or marked as invalid
so what makes that work is that I have
this semih to toe random pattern so any
little patch is not can't be matched
everywhere but his match sort of just in
one place well along that FP pole line I
know those patterns and so I can just
drive that search very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
