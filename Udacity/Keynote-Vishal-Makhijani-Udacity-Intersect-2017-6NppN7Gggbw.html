welcome to the computers History Museum
and welcome to Silicon Valley at Udacity
our mission is to Ma critized education
we started on this path when sebastian
and peter norvig
put their AI class from stanford online
back in 2011 at Udacity democratizing
education means lifelong learning
what's lifelong learning let's talk
about it today we're living longer than
ever we'll have to walk means we have to
work longer than ever into our 60s and
70s at the same time though we're
experiencing unprecedented technical
technological change technology is
disrupting everything we know retail
manufacturing transportation health care
even education forcing us to learn new
skills to stay relevant for a career
that could span over 40 years in fact
this idea is so relevant the economists
as you know an amazing publication
featured the notion of lifelong learning
their January issue I urge you to check
it out at Udacity we aspire to be the
place where you go to learn the skills
you need to get that next great job
today we can't be limited by the
knowledge that we learn in our early 20s
we need to be constantly learning this
isn't news to you guys though you guys
already get this but this is going to be
the new normal for the foreseeable
future you'd ask to be offerings enable
lifelong learning we're teaching we're
reaching to the future giving giving you
access to fields like AI machine
learning skills are gonna be great for
decades to come
in 2016 Udacity turned five years old
and yet at this time last year there was
no self-driving car program no virtual
reality program no deep learning program
no AI program we hadn't launched
something called Udacity blitz yet we
hadn't lost Udacity Connect yet and we
haven't even debuted something all
Udacity Talks where we talked where we
talked to amazing folks from technology
in our nano degree plus program was only
a couple months old all of that happened
in the last year at this time last year
we had 10,000 students in our interview
programs this doesn't count of course
the millions of folks who takes of our
offerings for free in the past year we
now reached 25,000 students just in that
short period of time that growth has
been global too last year this time we
are students held in our nano degree
programs from 84 different countries
we've increased that sixth over sixty
percent this year our native programs
represent folks in a hundred and thirty
six countries and as Shiraz mentioned
we're so excited to have so many of you
from all four many of those countries
today in fact there's a map outside
today I see where you can see where
every single one of our students hails
from it's really cool you should check
it out
let's talk about our Navy programs our
native programs are specifically focused
to get you a job from beginner all the
way to the bleeding edge in our navigate
programs you'll benefit from mentorship
code reviews by real people robust
career support and of course access to
amazing hiring companies in our
foundations programs we teach you things
like Android basics and we in our one of
our most popular programs is
introduction to programming in fact we
just hit our thousandth grad in IP nd in
our web area which is where our nano
degree started we help you become either
a front-end or a full-stack developer
our mobile offerings are comprehensive
we work very closely with Google on
something called Android fast-track that
gets you trained and Google certified
and ready to get a job as fast as you
can in fact on highway 101 which I know
many of you were caught on this morning
you'll see a great billboard talking all
about it in data science we have
multiple offerings starting from
learning data science with absolutely no
coding experience all the way up to
machine learning our students are doing
amazing things with the day with their
data science skills in fact they're
working they have amazing jobs as
analyst in companies as well as building
platforms and financial institutions
last fall we started something called
only at Udacity and these programs have
been met with amazing demand first our
self-driving car program it's unique in
the world you can't do this anywhere
else we have over 5,000 students to this
program already you get to put your code
on a real car our VR program launches
you into the world of VR helps you in
platforms like oculus and vive all the
way to mobile
you'll see a lot more about VR this
afternoon our AI program is a survey or
overview of artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence is the new
frontier as you might know AI is helping
in areas like cancer diagnostics
automating factories and it's even in
your home now with things with amp like
Amazon Alexa and Google home and finally
our deep learning foundations class
which launches you into this category
was so popular just last month we had to
close it to new students today we're
proud to open up our second class and
deep learning and you can sign up today
at Udacity calm now this world of online
learning and lifelong learning is
relatively new for the industry so for
that reason we launched something called
Udacity blitz a few months ago bliss is
our program to help our graduates
demonstrate the skills they've been
learning so the way it works is blitz
allows companies to build specific
projects our students build it they get
paid for it and student and companies
get to see how awesome your skills are
in fact we encourage our companies our
company clients to steal you from our
platform projects include everything
from web apps to mobile apps virtual
reality virtual reality to data science
and as I mentioned I'm sorry and I think
we're up over a hundred projects right
now on blitz already we launched
something else called Udacity connect in
the past year our online learning
approach allows folks all over the
planet to learn at a very reasonable
cost
however some folks want a little bit
more inspired by our friends at Google
in Cairo and Egypt last year we launched
Udacity Connect and it was so successful
we started on a program to launch it up
ton of other places here in the US we
launched in San Francisco San Jose Los
Angeles and New York in addition we've
launched in Warsaw in Poland as well as
Paris Madrid London Berlin and Saudi
Arabia our students have performed
amazingly well and Udacity Connect
making more progress and finishing
faster than online alone in fact our
most recent launch has been in Saudi
Arabia we're thrilled to be working with
the Saudi government and we plan to
educate almost 3,000 people on our first
programs there and as Sarah was
mentioning today's International Women's
Day we're pleased to announce in our
opening class in Saudi Arabia half our
students are women we're excited to
provide opportunities from folks with
all kinds of back
to reach their potential in line with
our mission to democratize education
scholarships are playing a role too
Udacity along with amazing partners of
ours have been working to help people
from underrepresented groups from women
veterans folks from specific geographies
geographies we have programs for all
kinds of them by this time last year we
had granted 1500 scholarships over the
last year we've fought you know 4x that
we're up to six thousand scholarships
granted and much of the work has been as
I mentioned done with some of our
partners specifically Google and AT&amp;amp;T
we're going to continue to expand our
scholarship program and you'll see
entering more markets in more areas over
the next coming year numbers are awesome
but really matter our individuals and
students Connie got one of our Udacity
transcended scholarships and was able to
earn a full stack nano degree with us
she's changing her life for her family
and herself
in addition Salvatore from Italy got
through another Udacity scholarship
learned machine learning skills and now
has a job as Amazon these stories are
awesome and just great jobs by Connie
and Salvador so now our focus is always
on students companies play a critical
role in our ecosystem our promise to our
students is to always be working with
the best companies for the best
curriculum and for the best jobs last
year at this time we were working very
closely with six companies this year
we're up to 65 many of those folks many
of those companies are here today and
the shiraz mentioned you should make
sure you get a chance to talk to some of
them these companies are the who's who
and technology they include giants like
Amazon IBM Google Facebook ooh BRR
mercedes-benz BMW Bosch AT&amp;amp;T among
others there's also the startup
community very well represented
companies like slack DeeDee github and a
lot more so call these in we're going to
continue to add to this list it's
critical to what we do here at Udacity
now what ultimately matters is turning
all that learning and association with
all those companies into jobs last by
last March we were able to track 350 of
you students into jobs and at this point
were up over a thousand they've been
employed all over the world
95% of our nanodegree plus program
students get jobs within six months and
over 20 of you have found jobs at Google
increasing numbers are all it matter as
I mentioned before but we also like to
take a look at student stories let's
talk about some of these amazing
developers first James Patterson because
of his tenacity his hard work and of
course is Udacity experience too James
went from working at a McDonald's in
Southern California to a role as a
front-end developer in fact James is
here today there he is hey James let's
give a head
thanks James awesome story next we have
Jennifer Jennifer was a teacher and
worked at an Apple store but Jennifer
wanted more so she took a risk worked
really hard and her and grown man agree
to that risk has paid off to Jennifer's
also here today there she is
cool thing about Jennifer too is she's
taken on teaching as well so we're
really excited about that
and finally Omar Omar story is pretty
incredible
Omar is from Aleppo in Syria and because
of the tough stuff that's happened there
Omar had to leave ultimately Oh mark
chose to change his life he stays earned
to NATO degrees he's enrolled in two
more and he's working as an iOS
developer on our blitz platform and
actually if you search about Omar he's a
very well respected the iOS community
already
Omar's also here has made this trip
awesome story Omar stories like James
Jennifer and Omar are what inspires
every day at Udacity it's the truth it's
been an amazing year so a lots happened
in the year but let's focus on what's
coming today we have four awesome
announced announcements for you today
roll video for body seems to be a
speciality field in industrial robotics
where big clunky machines do repetitive
tasks like belly and packaging now the
board is very severe body that space and
toys in your home if you think about the
definition of robotics which is sensing
thinking making a decision and then
taking an action so many things in our
world are using robotic technology I
became a roboticist in a very beginning
of my studies because I care about
artificial intelligence but rather than
studying in a vacuum I wanted to build
some often robots are seen as something
very metallic and kooky from my point of
view where I've been doing robotics for
30 years it's not that at all it's
really about something very soft and
helps people you now have the conference
of reliable and cost-effective Liberia
paired with an amazing success
controllers in deep low intelligence
also things are coming together and I
predict we're gonna help you teams in
the next five days
involve our nano degree program and
explore with us the fascinating
we're thrilled we're thrilled for this
brand-new program robotics offers
solutions for some of our greatest
challenges as we confront the dangers of
everything from natural disasters to
modern warfare robots are making us
safer and helping us respond faster
robots are also being used in areas like
agriculture surgery manufacturing and
automating all kinds of things they're
being used in stock rooms and cleaning
offices as we age we also be able to use
robots to help us in our in our old age
spending on robotics and related
services is going to top a hundred and
thirty five billion dollars in just the
next two years robotics are going to
improve our quality of life the advanced
robotics for manufacturing Institute
here in the United States forecast
adding half a million jobs here in the
next decade all this convergence and
opportunity makes this the right time
for us to launch our robotics nano
degree and we have amazing partners as
usual electric movement at a robotics
company based here in the valley is our
curriculum partner and we have amazing
hiring partners to add Lockheed Martin
iRobot Bosch cuca megabots and of course
uber our partners can't wait to see the
candidates that are coming out of this
program and we can't wait to see in this
program either the nanodegree is going
to be divided into two terms each term
will be $1,200 and students will have to
learn to build the software and to work
on real robots this program applications
open up today at Udacity comm go and
apply now for our next in a degree roll
video
Marketing is all around us and it's
constantly evolving the world has gone
digital and so has marketing actually
annually about seventy billion dollars
in the US alone is spent on digital
marketing at Udacity we've partnered
with the leaders in advertising and in
social media to prepare you for Korean
digital marketing digital marketing
allows you to unleash creativity way way
way more than the marketing used to be
able to do in the past when I went to
MBA school fifteen sixteen years ago
they taught me in my marketing class the
Holy Grail is the right person right
time right message the Internet is the
only platform that actually makes it
possible and that's why I am excited
about digital model we're really excited
to collaborate with Udacity to help
these students out there to learn not
just about Facebook itself but really to
learn the fundamentals of marketing we
build this nanodegree program to teach
you the full range of digital marketing
skills from search to social media
display advertising email marketing and
analytics what makes this program
special are all the real-world projects
that we have in it so students get to
run live advertising campaigns and the
major marketing platforms and then get
expert feedback to improve their results
and the biggest most amazing awesome
advantage of taking the course that
Udacity and Google have partnered on is
that you get a ton of practical
knowledge we're very excited about this
program and we're really looking forward
to seeing our students launch their
careers in digital marketing
right
we're excited to reach out outside of
our normal kind of zones of software
development AI and data science to help
you with digital marketing every
business today needs to engage in
digital marketing every company has to
figure out how to do business on the web
and mobile to give you sense of the
opportunities anka mentioned 70 billion
dollars will be spent in digital
advertising just in the US and it's
expected to grow over 40 percent over
the next few years but digital
advertising isn't just digital marketing
sorry is it is it digital market isn't
just as still advertising marketing
Clute encompasses content strategy
social media search engine optimization
search engine marketing email marketing
and finally being able to measure and
analyze that with platforms like Google
Analytics students will learn all of
those things with a mate from amazing
companies Facebook Google HubSpot
HootSuite MailChimp Moz and more and
international ecommerce partners Rakatan
and Zalando will sign on as hiring
partners as well and as you might know
you'd actually always does something a
little bit special under nanodegrees and
in this case students will run actual
live campaigns on real marketing
platforms like Google and Facebook and
learn to analyze those results develop
real insights and you be able to build a
marketing portfolio that employers will
be probably excited about anyone can
join this program and companies can't
wait in fact many of our partners have
been asking for this one for a long time
our digital marketing program is a three
month program and it's open for
registration today and we have a special
we're announcing an introductory price
of $6.99 which is a $300 savings if you
sign up this month and for our third
announcement we already have a strong
partnership with Dede who are leaders in
technology and mobility for those of you

self-driving car Challenge in
collaboration with Dede here are some of
the details the challenges will be
worldwide anyone can enter you don't
need to be in the self-driving car
program or even Udacity student at this
point the challenge is to build

this competition
Bob Zhang the CTO of DD has come all the
way from China Bob can you come on up
thank you thank you wish and Sebastian
hello everyone my name is Bob town I am
the co-founder and the city of DD I am
very excited to be here to launch the
self-driving car project challenge with
Udacity our great partner and educator
for the future TD is the word largest
mobile transportation platform we
founded our company four years ago now
we have more than 400 million users and
thus of more than 20 million passengers
every day TD is a big data company every
vehicles working on our platform tell a
platform their current location their
speed in average 3 seconds which give us
more than 70 terabyte of data every day
our fleet in Beijing will cover every
load for 300 times every day our vision
is to change no transportation by
innovation and bring the world closer
over the past 20 years Internet
technology has almost resolved the
problem of information sharing what we
want to do is to impact physical world
moving people or physical scenes from
point A to B more safely and efficiently
in my perspective in the next 10 years
there will be three layers of innovation
in transportation the bottom layer is
the transportation infrastructure a
smarter traffic light intelligent road
network planning and so on the middle
layer is the transition of vehicle from
gas filled vehicle to a new energy
vehicle
the intelligent driving technology will
make driving more safer and efficient
the top layer is the relationship
between people and vehicle fewer people
will choose to own a car but just a
shower we are an company which put much
attention on innovation this project
won't be possible without pass the
talent we have already invested five
