of the hangouts on air for nanodegree
today I'm doing with mike Wales and I'm
Jonathan bernis today we're going to be
talking about project 3i which mike
wells actually put together for
everybody and we hope you've been
enjoying it so far we wanted to talk a
little bit about like our expectations
and sort of what the minimum
requirements for the project I'm so as
you can see here when we load up the
game we have our little player character
starting in the middle of the grass i
mean you can realistically start
anything starting her
yeah so the minimum requirements we
usually ask for it is first of all that
right that the little guy can move
around this is using the direction bees
and that functionality is pretty much
already built in the the key handling is
already put in you just have to kind of
watch for the key handling and adjust
the data of your players so that
whenever it draws it draws in the new
position
yeah our players should be sort of
confined in the window right so if I can
move my player I can't go any further
right even though I'm mashing right and
I can't go any further left even like
mashing left and if he happens to fall
off the window then he's kind on the
game right so we want to try to avoid
things like this where the player can
just sort of step out of bounds right
and then the second thing is that the
bugs move across the screen so here we
got a bunch of bugs flying across the
screen at different speeds and these are
the vehicles a bad guy yeah they had
guys that you gotta try to avoid so we
can see that there's just this constant
stream of bugs so let's kind of recap
those three things were quick player
moves bugs move and player doesn't
follow the screen
mhm the fourth piece of functionality
we're looking for which you probably
just saying is if I happen to get hit by
one of these bags here
oh now I all the way back to the
beginning it at the last little piece of
functionality is sort of winning the
game in the sense and that's if I'm able
to to get all the way across the road
and again we not hit anything here might
get across it resets the game as well
which is acceptable
um you can go as crazy as you want yes
take this is the minimum viable passing
product project so then the next thing
we have a sort of the criteria of
object-oriented carrot uh let's talk a
little bit about that so therefore
course this is Bill top of his object
oriented generator course we're going to
a little detail about what we mean by
object-oriented sort of how that differs
from maybe some of the programming
people are familiar with ya
so object-oriented programming
particularly in javascript is whenever
you write about what we call a class and
so JavaScript we really don't have
classes but we kind of make it a class
in javascript is any structure that can
create a fleet of objects that are
similar in nature so your bugs for
instance you have three different bugs
uh there's really no point having to
write this out three different times you
just create the general structure that
defines a bug and then you instantiate
that object a few times one of the
biggest things we're looking for is
using the prototype object correctly uh
you don't want to define a surrender and
update functions on every single object
that's on the screen you want that type
of functionality to be on the class that
in stancy instantiates the objects so
then the last three sections and the
rubric I think should be pretty
straightforward code quality we're just
asking that you kind of adhere to the
style guide we provide you you format
your code it's easy to read i think
that's sort of the biggest point is that
if you were to give this to your mom who
doesn't know any JavaScript you'd at
least be able to look at it like be able
to point out like 10 lines yeah like oh
this makes sense yeah just be consistent
we've had some questions regarding like
spaces do i use for spaces two spaces i
use tabs are just be consistent with
your your spacing and you're the way you
lay things out and like you said it
we want it to be readable by our coaches
and uh and not just like one line string
of symbols then the next one is comments
i think comments are should be pretty
common practice in any sort of
programming video even with HTML like
leaving comments and just say oh this is
what sort of this
section is for comments are just sort of
a programmer to programmer way of
communicating exactly so you don't want
to have a comment that says like draw
the book because it's pretty obvious
that line is drawing the blog comments
are really good for answering the
question of why am i doing something
this way it really is programmer to
programmer talk ten years down the road
when you move on to the company and some
guy takes over your application you want
to leave enough comments that he doesn't
want to track you down and kill you
should i had the last one documentation
where we asked the students to provide
us or read me final I'd say that's more
just so you get into the habit of
writing sort of a readme right this is
if you're sending this game to a friend
and wanted to be able to show it to them
yet and especially if you really go
above and beyond kind of really make
this game your own a little bit of a
readme of some of the additions you add
in how you did that that would all be
really really great i mean as as
documented as you can make your project
the better it's going to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
