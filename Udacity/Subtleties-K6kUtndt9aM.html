happens for example if the length of the
document is zero all of a sudden you
have divided by zero right okay right so
we're going to have that we would have
to consider that as a special case also
what exactly do we mean by the size of
the handle as we as we said we probably
from the GUI tool toolkit would get some
pixels a number of pixels but we would
need to translate that into something
like a percentage or an integer count of
things and then there's there's a even
more subtle situation let's say that
we've scrolled to the end of the file
okay
and we resize the window to make it
bigger okay what happens what what do we
expect to see in the viewport so one
possibility is we would see exactly the
same lines but now some blank lines at
the bottom okay
another possibility is that the line
that was at the bottom of the view port
before stays at the bottom of the
viewport and we see some more lines at
the top okay and in fact if you go play
around with actual web browsers out
there and and with word processing
editors and so on you can see both of
these behaviors however if we're
designing the application we have to
make the decision about which one of
those two behaviors we actually intend
that the text browser to have okay so
this process of modeling has forced us
into thinking about something which we
might not have otherwise thought about
which is one of the one of the the
benefits of doing the modeling it forces
you to think through subtleties of
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
