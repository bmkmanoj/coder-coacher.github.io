degree program it's really important for
you to evaluate whether or not you're
ready for the kinds of things we're
going to talk about we're going to try
and build as much knowledge necessary
for machine learning into the curriculum
but there's some things you need to know
before you get started if you aren't
familiar with any of these things we
invite you to use some of the resources
that we've provided or some of the
resources available online to learn the
requisite knowledge to get started
generally speaking what you really need
to know to get started is some math you
need to know some basic statistics some
basic calculus and some basic linear
algebra if you can do things like
calculating a standard deviation by hand
calculating a derivative or calculating
a determinant of a matrix then you're
probably ready to get started here now
of course at some point during the
nanodegree program you might come across
something that you aren't familiar with
and in that case we invite you to pause
go look up at some additional
information and learn what you need to
know to move forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
