to do an inventory of our assets what is
that we have which is of value and
something that is of value of course as
to there has to be some risk to it so
there has to be a threat that is the
source of that risk that is faced by
this particular asset so the services
the software the hardware these are the
assets that we have and we have to
concern ourselves about securing them so
when you think about cyber security and
planning for it of course you have to
worry about all these assets or the list
of what needs to be secured has to
include all these when you talk about
the software so this is sort of the
hardware and comes to software we
running operating systems on these
servers or laptops or mobile devices the
databases that store large amounts of
data perhaps the services that are
talking about the applications actually
we have on these devices again when it
comes to software and services we have
to worry about that and of course the
databases or the file systems the
storing lots of data either structured
data or in files some of the data is
going to be sensitive some of it could
be highly sensitive could be your
intellectual property you could be in
employee records and things like that so
of course we have to say where this data
resides what kind of database which
server and are we securing the server
the database and the data that's stored
in it and whenever you talk about assets
and securing them securing them from
whom are we concerned about external
attackers or hackers and you know they
could be cyber criminals they could be
motivated for some other reason
activists for example activists perhaps
don't like you or your business or
whatever it is
so is it remote hackers that concern us
when it comes to securing all these
assets that we are talking about or its
insiders its employees within the
organization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
