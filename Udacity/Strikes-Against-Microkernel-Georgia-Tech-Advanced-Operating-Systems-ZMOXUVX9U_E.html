microkernel based design the first
strike is the border crossing cost going
between kernel and the user and vice
versa and this you have to do every time
a user level process makes a system call
you have to go through the kernel that's
the border crossing cost so that is the
first explicit cost that can be a strike
against microkernel if this would have
happened too often the second strike
against a microkernel based design is
address based switches with the
assumption that each system service is
living in its own Hardware address space
whenever an application needs any system
service that may involve the server's
living above the microkernel having to
talk to one another in order to provide
that particular service that was
requested by the application and I
mentioned that protected procedure call
is a basis for cross protection domain
calls so here is a protection domain a
filesystem here is another protection
domain the storage module and if the
filesystem has to get some service out
of the storage module in order to serve
the original request from the
application process that communication
is implemented as a protected procedure
call and going across Hardware address
spaces minimally involves flushing the
TLB of the processor in order to make
room for the TLB entries of the domain
that we are entering and we will talk
about that in a little bit more detail
shortly but the key point is there is an
explicit cost involved in going from one
address space to another address space
and that is the second strike against a
microkernel based design the third
strike against microkernel based design
is the cost for doing thread switches
these thread switches have to be
mediated by the kernel if the file
system
needs to make a protected procedure
called to the storage module in order to
complete an application-level
request for an operating system service
that involves the file system having to
be mediated through the microkernel in
order to go and execute some
functionality in the storage module so
that involves a thread switch and IPC in
order to do that so in other words the
basis for protected procedure call is
thread switches and inter process
communication which has to be mediated
through the kernel and this kernel
mediation can be expensive that is
threat switches and inter process
communication can be expensive that's
the third strike against a microkernel
so all of these three strikes that I
mentioned are explicit costs associated
with providing an application level
service in a microkernel based operating
system because the application has to
first make a request to the microkernel
microkernel may have to pass that
request on to server processes that are
living above the microkernel and the
server processes may have to talk to one
another and this protected procedure
call itself has to be mediated by the
microkernel we are thread switching and
inter process communication and in
addition to all of these explicit costs
there could be a fourth cost which is
the implicit cost and this is due to the
memory subsystem and the loss of
locality
that can happen when we are going across
address spaces and when the filesystem
makes a protected procedure call into
the storage module at that point we are
changing locality from the address space
of the filesystem to the address space
of the storage module and therefore the
thread that starts executing inside the
storage module may not find the cache
warm meaning the contents of the cache
may not be reflecting the working set of
the storage module that needs to get
executed right now
in order to satisfy the request coming
from the file server and this loss of
locality can be both for address
translation in the TLB for this new
address space that we are in as well as
for data and instructions that are
contained in the cache both of those may
take a hit because of the fact that we
are going from one address space to
another address space that's the
implicit cost of the locality loss that
would be the fourth strike against a
microkernel based design all of these
strikes against a microkernel based
design seems pretty solid now how does
l3 go about debunking the myths about
microkernel based design let's see that
systematically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
