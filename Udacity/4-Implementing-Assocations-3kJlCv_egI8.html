trickier than generalization is figuring
out how to implement associations Oh
programming languages do not directly
support associations so the 00 design
process must choose the best means of
implementing these associations some of
the factors you have to take into
account first off is directionality what
this means is if your program is going
to need to interact with several classes
is the direction of that interaction
always in one particular way first day
and then be or it might you go in either
way second is cardinality that is for a
particular instance of one class are
there multiple instances in another
class and third is the kind of access
you're making two classes sometimes
these are called the crud properties or
c stands for create that is are you
going to create instances r is for read
that means are you just going to query
or access the instances you is for
update that is could you change the
instances and D is for delete depending
on which of these particular kinds of
accesses and how frequently they occur
it might particularly in the performance
area affect how you choose to implement
them and finally as far as invariant
maintenance as our concern ok
associations often have in variance
associated with them like referential
integrity constraints and it's up to you
as the designer and programmer to build
your program in such a way that these
invariants are maintained</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
