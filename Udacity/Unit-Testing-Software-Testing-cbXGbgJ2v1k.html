spend a lot of time in this course
looking at and unit testing means
looking at some small software module at
a time and testing it in an isolated
fashion and so this is what we were
doing with the bounded buffer example
from the last unit and with the square
root function that we're talking about
earlier in this unit the main thing that
decision wishes unit testing from other
kinds of testing is that we're testing a
small smaller amount of software often
the person performing the unit testing
is the same person who implemented the
module in that case we may well be doing
white box testing but unit testing can
also be black box testing goal of unit
testing is to find defects in the
internal logic of the software under
test as early as possible in order to
create more robust software modules that
we can compose later with other modules
ended up with a system that actually
works
besides the size of the saw of the
software under test the other thing that
distinguishes unit testing from other
kinds of testing is that generally at
this level we have no hypothesis about
the patterns of usage of the software
under test in other words we're going to
try to test the unit with inputs from
all different parts of its domain
remember the domain is the set of
possible inputs for this for this piece
of software unit testing is also a kind
of testing that enjoys a great deal of
good tool support and so Python in fact
has a number of frameworks for unit
testing it also has a number of
frameworks for what are called mock
objects and what mock objects are is
fake objects we can bolt onto the
software under test that mock up the
behavior of the larger software system
in which this unit lives and what we'll
do is we'll include links to some of
these tools in the supplemental material
for this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
