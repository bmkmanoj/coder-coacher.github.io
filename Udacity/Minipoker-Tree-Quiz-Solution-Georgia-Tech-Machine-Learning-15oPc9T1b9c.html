start with a resigner resigner
all right resign a resigner resign
resign or diner all right e soso
resigner vs. dinosaur resigner if a is a
resigner that means whenever a gets a
red card a resigns yes and that would be
a negative 20 yep but that's not going
to be the answer is it it's good because
a doesn't always a doesn't always get a
red card a sometimes gets a black card
if being it's a black card then a resign
a resigner that means B is going to
resign and a plus 10 will happen mm-hmm
so those are the two possibilities and
they're equally likely so it's a minus
10 divided by 2 which is minus 5 right
you are correct sir
Shu all right which one you want to do
next
resigner seer okay so again oh so that
yeah this is a good choice because now
it's the same argument as before except
for when we end up in that far right
node and that means minus 20 and half
the cases plus 30 and a half the cases
which is a plus 10 divided by 2 or plus
5 that's exactly right well done Michael
Thanks okay which one next so holder
resigner so holder resigner that means
when a gets a card a is going to hold
the card mm-hmm and that's true red or
black yep and then then it's gonna be
b's turn and B is going to oh we're
doing holder resigner so it's gonna
resign so oh well interestingly I think
that takes us to those two leaves both
of which are plus 10 yep because why
does that make sense because B Oh cuz B
doesn't get any right right right
because it's independent the card you
actually said that when you explain the
rules mm-hmm so it's it's average of
plus 10 and plus 10 which ought to be
plus 10 it is in fact plus 10 well done
okay what about holders here all right
so that's the case where a holds so we
go down those branches and we're end up
we're always end up in one of the blue
circled States yep and B sees half the
time that leads to minus 40 half the
time that leads to plus 30 so that's
minus 10
/ - which is - five again yeah that's
exactly so that's correct Michael and
that's pretty cool isn't it yeah I
really like this game it's I didn't
think you could have anything that had
sort of poker essence and be this tiny
so yeah so we end up with this really
nice little structure here so I have a
question for you you ready for the
question I'm trying to guess what it is
but sure okay here's my question what is
the value of this game I was thinking
that you might ask that
so can I can I step through it is that
okay yeah sure go ahead so a is choosing
the first row over the second row so if
a chooses the first row and then me
chooses the column then if it's the
first row B's gonna choose the first
column so today's gonna get minus 5
mm-hmm
the same story's gonna go through on the
bottom row a if a chooses the bottom row
then B's gonna choose the seer position
which gets the minus 5 right so from
this so it seems like that the value the
game is minus 5 but now let's do the
same thing on the B column so if me
resigns now a gets to choose resign or a
holder and again it gets a plus 10 and
if Beast is a seer then a chooses
between resigner and holder it gets plus
5
yes so then from this perspective it's
the value of the game is plus 5 so so
here's a case where it better not be
that we could take a perfect information
game and put it into a matrix and get
this out because this is something that
can't like it doesn't it doesn't fit
your theorem right we can't get the
value of it by doing minimax or maximun
exactly the problem here is that once
you move the hidden information minimax
is not necessarily and in this case
definitely is not equal to maximum so
von Neumann fails as we all see any any
we would yeah what has he ever done for
us anyway
his theorems in his computer
architecture that rules the world anyway
so we seem to have a problem here and
the problem is that once we go to others
hidden information as I promised
complexity enters in Michael and now we
can't do something very simple with the
matrix find up your strategy that's
going to work it really is the case that
a strategy depends upon what B will do
in B strategy depends upon what a will
do and if you don't already know what
that's going to be you don't actually
have a value for the game and in some
sense you can get every single one of
these
values so there's got to be some
remember I feel like that's sort of what
you'd expect in a game like this right
so if because of the way that it is if
you know that I'm always a resigner that
I'm always going to wet oh that whenever
whenever I have a red card I'm going to
resign then you know that if I don't
resign I have a black card so you know
that you should resign mm-hmm yeah so
it's it's it's one of these things where
if I am really consistent and never
Bluff say then you can take advantage of
me and vice versa like if you always
respond the same way to when I act a
certain way then I can manipulate that
so it's kind of like this game of this
sort of mind game right like I want you
to not know that I know the thing that
you don't know that I don't know right
but the problem is that I know what you
know and I know that you know what I
know and that I know that you know that
I know what you know that I know what
you know what I know what you know what
I know and so they think I didn't know
that and so you end up in this terrible
situation but there was a key word that
you used there Michael and it was
consistent and everything that we talked
about so far pure strategies is exactly
the same thing as talking about
consistency so the way we're going to
get around this is we're going to stop
being consistent release consistent in
the same way okay yeah and the cheat
here is that we are now going to
introduce instead of pure strategies
let's see the opposite of pure is impure
mixed that's exactly right
contaminated No so rather than sticking
with pure strategies we're going to
start using mixed strategies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
