to this well the number of times that it
gets divided in half before it reaches
zero is this expression log base two of
a plus one but notice what's happening
each time that we divide it in half
we're actually adding three to the pile
so this is not quite right we actually
need to do three times this which is
like this but then when we get to the
bottom there's going to be one more
added into the sum this is the answer in
this particular instance we got kind of
lucky that we happen to have a
recurrence relation that we could
analyze using one of the formulas that
we've already worked out one of the
things we're going to do next time is
look at these kinds of relationships
more generally how do we take a
recurrence relation and turn it into a
concrete formula without getting bogged
down in all the details and one of the
things we're going to try to do is
ignore some of these pesky constants
like the threes and the fours and so
forth so we can take a function like T
of a and say well it kind of grows in a
log like manner and not really get too
worried about the details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
