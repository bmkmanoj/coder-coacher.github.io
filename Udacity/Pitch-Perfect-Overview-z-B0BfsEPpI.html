create in this lesson called pitch
perfect pitch perfect allows you to
record your voice and play it back with
various sound effects including changes
to speed pitch and even reverb and echo
let's run it on the iOS simulator so
that I can show it to you the first
screen simply prompts you to record your
voice here at Udacity we believe that
asking questions is one of the best ways
to learn judge amend by his questions
rather than his answers now you can see
pitch-perfect has moved us to the
playback view where we can choose to
play back my voice using a variety of
different sound effects
let's try listening to it really fast
how about what I would sound like as
Darth Vader this app is a lot of fun to
play with but more importantly you will
learn key iOS development concepts along
your way it will also be the start of
your journey as an iOS developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
