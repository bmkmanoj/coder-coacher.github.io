strategy and a mixed strategy Michael
well it's simply this a mixed strategy
simply implies or means some
distribution over strategies so in the
case of two strategies like we have here
where you can either a can be either a
resigner or holder we're gonna simply
say that the mixed strategy for a is
some value for P which is the
probability of choosing to be a holder
so do you see what's going on here so
the only difference between a mixed
strategy and pure strategy is that for a
mixed strategy you choose some
probability over all the different
strategies that you might choose so you
decide that you know going into this I'm
gonna flip a coin and half the time I'm
gonna be a resigner and half the time
I'm gonna be a holder say or 30% of the
time I'll be a resigner and 70% of time
I'll be a holder okay yep wires with
pure strategies you always chose one or
the other so technically it's the case
that a pure strategy is also a mixed
strategy where all the probability
masses on a single strategy make sense
so in this case we're gonna in fact
choose P to represent the probability
for a of choosing to be a holder rather
than a resigner
and so P can be 0% probability 0 or
could be probability 1 or any value in
between with me on that yeah that's neat
ok good to make certain you understand
this I'm gonna give you a little quiz
which I have up here on the screen you
ready oh I think those those very square
boxes yes what this could be about they
certainly couldn't be a quiz because
Charles has never drawn a straight box
and it's life I hand drew those Michael
it took me 17 hours oh man you're you're
committed to this and I appreciate that
I am committed to this ok so given that
we have a mixed rata G and we have a
probability P of a being a holder here's
my question for you in a world where B
is a resigner
okay B is always going to choose to
resign what is a z' expected profit to
make it easy for you I copied the matrix
over here in the upper right hand corner
wait wait wait if B is always a resigned
B is always a resigner then what's and
what is a a is going to choose to be a
hold
with probability P oh so you want this
to be a function of P maybe if it's if
it's okay sure it could well I mean yes
it's a function of P it just might be a
constant function that ignores be it
could be principal okay now well after
you figure that out I want you to decide
in a world where B is a seer B always
chooses to see the card
what would a is expected profit B in a
world where a will choose to be a holder
with probability P okay got it
and that's gonna be oh yeah that could
be different because it's a it's a
different strategy though you know C
ring-like like if you're a resigner
you're resigner but if your seer then
what you're doing is searing mm-hmm that
would be an anagram of resigner how do
you see these things I don't know
they're just there I just say the words
just kind of mix themselves up alright
anyway I think I'm ready to do the
function I'm ready to stop looking at
the letters okay and go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
