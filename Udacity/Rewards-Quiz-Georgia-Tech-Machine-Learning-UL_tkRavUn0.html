ready sure okay so here's what's going
on I have copied over our little grid
world over here twice so it's the same
grid world except I have changed the
rewards that you will receive in all of
the states other than the two absorbing
states so for the top one you get a
reward of plus two in every single state
except for the absorbing states and in
the bottom one you receive a reward of
minus two in every single state but the
absorbing states got it interesting so
what I'm gonna want you to do is I'm
gonna want you to fill in for these
boxes that I've indicated these same
four boxes in the top and the bottom
whether you should go up down left or
right so enter into each one of them
either up you beat down our right left
okay yeah I appreciate you making the
numbers nice and big because I was
worried you were gonna say something
like minus point one three but this is
like no no no that wasn't a suggestion
yeah let's go with the plus 2 and minus
two I feel like there's a better chance
I might be able to get it okay but so
you think you got the what we're trying
to do here I do now just to just to keep
just to make sure that I'm there the
plus 1 and the minus 1 end the game yes
there's no more reward after that's like
zero forever yep and the other things
the blueish rewards I would get them
continually until a state is reached
right exactly where the game ends okay
yeah no that's that's that's that's cool
okay cool all right so go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
