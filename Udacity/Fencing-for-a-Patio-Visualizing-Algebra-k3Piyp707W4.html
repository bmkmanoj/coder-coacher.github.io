of equations to problem solve here's our
first problem it would take 42 feet of
fencing to enclose your rectangular
patio if the area of the patio is 108
square feet what are the dimensions of
the patio so here this is my patio in
black and then this orange part is my
fencing now this view isn't so helpful
we're going to take a bird's-eye view
and look down into our patio to figure
this problem out essentially our pattern
looks like this it's a rectangle in
shape and it has a length and it has a
width what we want to do is take our
equations for perimeter and area and
make them into two equations with a
system of two variables in other words
we just want to have two equations with
only L and W in them since we know it
would take 42 feet of fencing to enclose
our rectangular patio we know that the
perimeter equals 42 feet notice that the
perimeter is even so we can divide each
of these by 2 to get a new equation that
is 21 equals L plus W we know the area
of the patio is 108 square feet so we
can replace this area with the value of
a hot ornate now notice that we have two
equations with two variables l and w
this is a system of equations and we
solve something like this before we're
going to go ahead and solve the system
using substitution first i'm going to
subtract w from both sides of this
equation to get 21 minus W equals L so
now I want you to use substitution to
solve this system of equations we know
the length equals 21 minus W so we can
replace this length with 21 minus W I
want you to make this substitution and
then solve for the width and the length
after you solve the length should be the
longer side between the two as a hint
when you substitute 21 minus W and
pharrell you should wind up with
something that's quadratic use what you
know about factoring and try and find
the length and the width good luck here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
