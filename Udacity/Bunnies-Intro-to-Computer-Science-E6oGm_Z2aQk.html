ranking web search results I'm going to
talk about one more interesting
recursive definition the Fibonacci
series and Fibonacci numbers are one of
the most interesting things in
mathematics once you know about them
you'll see them all over the place both
in nature and in human designs the name
comes from Leonardo da Pisa who was also
known as Fibonacci and back in 1202 he
published a book called Liebherr Alba
Kai the root abaca is the same as the
one for abacus the calculating machine
and this translates loosely as book of
calculation this was the book that
introduced Indian mathematics to the
West in particular to introduce what we
now know as Arabic numerals this
replaced the Roman numeral system that
was then widely used and part of what
Fibonacci did in the book was show how
much easier it is to do calculations
using numbers in the decimal system
where the place where the number is
indicates his value and as part of the
book he introduced these problems and
showed how to solve them using
calculation the problem that became
known as the Fibonacci numbers was one
of the problems in the book and he posed
the problem like this so at the
beginning we have one pair of rabbits
and it takes one month for a rabbit to
produce offspring and every month a
mature rabbit will produce a new pair of
rabbits so at month one we had one pair
of rabbits at month two well we have the
one pair we started with and now we have
a new pair we have two pairs of rabbits
and now at months three the baby rabbits
aren't yet ready to produce offspring it
takes a month for the rabbits to reach
maturity but these two will produce new
offspring each month so we have one new
pair of baby rabbits and the rabbits
that were born in month two well they've
had a month to get bigger so now they're
mature rabbits so we have three pairs at
the end of month three someone four we
still have the three pairs of rabbits we
had rabbits never died in this model and
the two pairs that are mature both of
those will now produce new rabbits so we
have two new pairs of very rabbits the
baby rabbits that were born in one three
well now those are mature so now we have
three pairs of mature rabbits and two
pairs of baby rabbits so we have five
of rabbits total and this keeps going so
the model assumed that rabbits never die
that every month each pair of mature
rabbits produces a new pair of rabbit
babies and it takes one month for a pair
of rabbits that's born to become mature
so in month five the three mature pairs
of rabbits will all produce new
offspring we have new offspring new
offspring three new offspring and the
two that are a month old that we're born
in month four will now become mature so
this isn't a very accurate model of how
rabbits reproduce it's good for us if it
was an accurate model it would only take
a few years for rabbits to control the
entire planet but it's an interesting
mathematical model and the model that
this poses we can write in a more formal
way so the number of rabbits is the
number of rabbits we had in the previous
month since those rabbits don't want
died so in month 5 we had the 5 pairs
that we had in the previous month plus
all of the rabbits that were mature
meaning all the rabbits that we had two
months ago which was three if we're in
month five while those reproduce so we
have three new pairs of rabbits plus the
five that we had in the previous month
and this keeps going so we could in
month six we're gonna have the aid
rabbits that we had at the end of month
five plus the five mature pairs one two
three four five will each reproduce so
we'll have five new pairs and that will
give us 13 pairs of rabbits so this was
the model Fibonacci developed and the
question is can you figure out at the
end of months n given any number n how
many rabbits there will be so the way we
define this mathematically is a little
different from the way Fibonacci posed
the question and that's because in
modern mathematics we usually like our
series to start with a zero if we are
thinking of modeling rabbits well that
doesn't quite make sense to start with
zero rabbits but if we're thinking of it
as more general series it does so the
way it's defined mathematically is that
we say that the Fibonacci number zero is
defined as zero Fibonacci number one is
defined as one and those are our two
base cases so this is different
the other recursive definitions we've
seen in that the two base cases
previously all of our definitions just
had one base case and then we can define
every other Fibonacci number recursively
starting from these base cases and so
the Fibonacci number n where n is some
whole number greater than one is well we
have all the rabbits in the previous
month so that's Fibonacci of n minus one
plus all the new babies and the number
of new babies is the number of rabbits
we had two months ago those are all the
mature rabbits that gets added to the
number of rabbits we had the previous
month so that's how we define Fibonacci
numbers this defines every Fibonacci
number in terms of the two base cases
and in the one recursive case so your
goal is to define a procedure called
Fibonacci that takes a natural number as
input so numbers starting from zero any
whole number zero or higher and outputs
the value of that Fibonacci number
defined using this recursive definition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
