subset-sum I'm going to illustrate the
reduction with an example because
writing out the transformation and it's
full generality can get a little messy
even with just an example it may not be
clear why I'm making some of the
intermediate steps at the time it should
all become clear at the end however
we're going to create a table with
columns for the variables and columns
for the clauses the rows of the table
are going to be the numbers in our
subset and we'll have this column
represent the ones place this one the
tens place and so forth
the collection of numbers will consist
of two for every variable in the formula
one that we include when X I is true
we'll notate that with Y I and one that
we include when X I bar is true we'll
notate that with Zi in the end we want
to include either y i or zi for every i
since we have to assign the variable x i
one way or another to get a satisfying
assignment we also have to satisfy each
clause so we want the numbers Y I and C
I to reflect which clauses are satisfied
as well here then is how we fill out the
table y1 sets x1 to be true so we put a
1 in that column to indicate that
choosing y1 means assigning x1 and this
also satisfies clauses 1 and 3 since
that's where x1 appears including z1
would also assign the variable x1 a
value but it wouldn't satisfy any of the
clauses so all these are written as
zeroes we do the analogous procedure for
y2 and z2 the literal x2 appears in the
first Clause and the literal x2 bar
appears in clauses 2 &amp;amp; 3 and we do the
same for the variables x3 and x4 these
then are the numbers that we want to
include in our set a now we need to
choose our desired total K for each of
the variable clauses the desired total
is exactly 1 we assign each variable one
way or the other for these Clause
columns however the total just has to be
greater than 0 we just need one literal
in the clause to be true in order for
the clause to be satisfied but that
doesn't give me a specific K that we
need to sub to the trick is to add more
numbers to the table these all have
zeroes in the place corresponding to the
variables in exactly 1 1 in a column for
a clause each Clause J gets two numbers
that have a 1 in that column we'll call
them GJ + HJ so that's G 2 and H 2 have
a 1 in the column for C 2 and zeros
everywhere else this allows us to set
the desired number to be 3 in the clause
columns given a satisfying assignment
the corresponding choice of y&amp;amp;z numbers
will have at least a 1 and all the
Clause columns but no more than 3 all
the ones in twos can be boosted up by
including the G and H numbers
note that if some clause is unsatisfied
then including the GNH numbers isn't
enough to bring the total to three
because there are only two of them so
there's the construction for each
variable include one of the two
variables Y or Z which will correspond
to the truth setting and for each clause
include G and H so as to boost up this
total in the clause column to 3 where
needed this construction just involves a
few for loops so it's easy to see that
the construction of the set of numbers
is polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
