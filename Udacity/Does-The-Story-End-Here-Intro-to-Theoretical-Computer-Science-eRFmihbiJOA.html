some very fundamental concepts of
computer science and you understand the
issue of P versus NP we have also shown
that the problems that Alice Bob and
Carol were working on are among the
hardest problems in NP they are
np-complete so nobody knows if there's a
polynomial time algorithm for those
problems and actually finding one would
be a sensation now the question of
course is what does that mean for Alice
Bob and Carol should they just give up
should they ask their bosses to give
them a new problem or should they make
their bosses watch this Udacity course
in the next unit will be looking at two
things the first one is how to recognize
that a problem is np-complete and will
then turn our attention to what to do
when you encounter an np-complete
problem because well there will not only
be good news but as it turns out there's
still some options available it is
possible to poke loop holes into the
laws of np-completeness so there's still
hope for Alice Bob and Carol so see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
