we want this button to be in the form of
an image of a microphone let's add that
image next so I'll go back to Xcode and
manage some real estate I will hide the
document outline and slide in the
Navigator and hide the utility area
there now if you look in the navigator
there is this thing called images XC
assets XC stands for x code and assets
means that this thing is going to help
us manage assets or images in our app
the first thing to notice here is
something called app icon this is the
icon that represents our app on the
user's phone if you look at the bottom
of your screen you'll notice that we can
add any new images or assets here I'll
click on the plus button and then on new
image set let me rename this image set
to microphone there okay so here is an
image of the microphone on my computer I
want to highlight that the size of this
image is a hundred by hundred pixels by
the way this image is also available in
the instructor notes for you to use now
you can feel free to use this image or
you can customize your app by using your
own image or the image of a friend if
you'd like alright I'm going to drag
this image into the One X box there it
is now I'm going to start with one X and
then I'm going to ask you to guess what
2x and 3x mean so still sharp and see if
you can figure it out from this example
alright so next I'll go to my storyboard
and here I'll make sure that the record
button is selected and then I will open
up the utility area and under the
attributes inspector I will remove the
default text that I had added and then I
will go under images and try to find the
microphone image that I just added boom
there is my image now one really curious
thing to notice here is that after I've
selected my button if I go to the size
inspector this link right here I can
check out and see the width and the
height of my button which is both
hundred so that means that my button has
conformed to the size of the image
okay I'm going to go ahead and run my
project and there it is we have added an
image to our button now one thing to
notice here with this image is that it
looks a little bit blurry around the
edges you may have to lean in to see
this or I can actually go to the window
menu and change the scale of the phone
to 100% there see that the image looks
somewhat blurry around the edges hmm why
do you think the image is so blurry care
to venture a guess here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
