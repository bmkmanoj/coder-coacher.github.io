brackets that contains five strings each
one is a one letter string spelling out
the word hello and we've stored that in
the variable P we could do the same
thing we did with strings we could
reassign PITA a new value and if we did
that that would create a new list
containing the letters Y e ll o and
assign that to the variable P what we're
going to do instead is mutate the list
that we already created and we can do
that by modifying the value of its
elements so here we have an assignment
where on the left side of the assignment
we have P index 0 this means select from
the list that P refers to find position
0 instead of getting the value at that
position though since it's on the left
side of an assignment now we're going to
replace that value with what's on the
right side of the assignment in this
case the string containing the single
letter Y let's see what that looks like
so when we created the list
initially we have a list like this and
I'm going to draw the list showing boxes
so this is a list each box is one
element of the list and after the
initial assignment the value P refers to
is this list now when we do the
assignment where P index 0 is on the
left side well pinion x0 will find this
position the assignment will replace
what's there so we'll replace the H with
the Y note that we did not create a new
list P still refers to the same list we
didn't have to change the arrow but
we've changed the value of that list so
let's try this in the Python interpreter
so I've created a list with the elements
being 5 strings spelling out the word
hello and I can see that that's the
value of P now I'm going to use the
assignment expression to replace the
value in the first element and print P
again so now when we run we see that for
the first print the value of P is hello
for the second print the value of P is
yellow
we can change other values the same way
so now I've changed the value in
position four to an exclamation point
and we can see the third line printed
out we have yell with an exclamation
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
