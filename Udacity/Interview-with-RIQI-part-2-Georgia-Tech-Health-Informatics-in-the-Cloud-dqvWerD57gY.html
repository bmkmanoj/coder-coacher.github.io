Fontaine who's director of data quality
and analytics that the Rhode Island
quality Institute and current care thank
you very much for being with us today
thanks for having me we all know Elaine
that we need new financial models to
make make healthcare work do we'd like
it to work the students are quite
familiar with that from earlier lessons
in the course and they recognize that
those are intimately tied to quality
reporting and quality improvement so can
you tell us the things that current here
is doing to support provider's here in
Rhode Island to to achieve those things
so I think that we are currently
providing actually outside of current
care data quality data management and
reporting services for the chronic care
sustainability initiative which is rhode
island's patient-centered medical home
project and for that project we're
actually collecting and aggregating data
on about 15 quality measures that are
sort of related to meaningful use we're
also doing utilization reporting and
patient experience through the
patient-centered medical home caps
survey which is what NCQA requires of
those practices and with those data
we're really sort of looking grouping
them up and aggregating them in a
variety of ways to help the practices
see their performance over time and
assess their success with regard to
improving the quality and reducing costs
which is of course not that easy but you
know we think that the difference is in
the data source is associated with
what's available to the hie relative to
what's available to a EMR relative to
what's available in a claims data set
all of which are you know trying to be
used for the same purpose of of looking
at cost and quality really can
potentially result in different answers
to the same questions because the
populations are a little bit different
so for example we're working on a
chlamydia screening analysis and i'll be
presenting it a mia in in November of
this year in 2014 to look at the
differences in those rates between those
three population group
so you know a commercial payer will have
a different result than a Medicaid payer
which will have a different result than
what's coming out of the EMR and the hie
so we're we're trying to understand
those differences before we sort of
report them publicly from the
perspective of sort of here's how you do
a better job taking good care of quality
docs in the community so is it fair to
assume that the hie does serve to help
collect and ultimately aggregate the
data so that you can do this quality
report I feel like we're really pretty
nascent in that regard and so these
these chlamydia screening rates are our
first entree into it but I'm pretty
sensitive to the idea that we need to
understand those differences is it that
we as the hie have a self-selected
population which might have a higher
screening rate or a lower screening rate
than another group are we including the
uninsured which are not really
represented in anybody else's measures
so until we sort of dig into that and
really are able to benchmark against
known metrics on reticent to sort of
just say here's the real answer for the
population of Rhode Island and I think
that that's the goal and I feel
confident we're going to get there but
it's it's one that I think that we need
to move cautiously and in that regard
because the worst possible thing to do
is to report data without really
understanding what it means I think that
you can do that in some situations where
it's sort of marketing but quality and
cost analytics are not marketing and
when you're presenting information that
would reflect how a provider is
performing you need to make sure you
have their full engagement and input in
how that measure is calculated and they
need to be able to be very very
confident of its accuracy before your
report out the students remember these
comments when we later on in the course
we get into quality reporting and I try
to show that it sounds great but it
isn't so easy to do yeah it's it's it's
really quite challenging think about it
but it sounds like your long goal is
is to have a unified statewide
population and public health electronic
reporting system for the whole state of
Rhode Island is that where you're
heading it is absolutely where we're
heading and I believe that you know I
have most confidence that we're going to
be there and you know I I feel like we
talked internally a lot about you know
where we are today is you know light
years behind we're going to be in six
months and its light years ahead of
where we were six months ago I feel like
the progress is really rapid and I think
that's a large part due to a high degree
of interest as the as you know coming
full circle to the beginning of your
question the provider community is
becoming more and more interested in
these data because they are being held
accountable for them they the
accountable care organization news
releases but the cycle is moving very
rapidly we've just seen in the last
three weeks three or four announcements
in the news of payer provider
arrangements that are outside of
Medicare so that's pretty interesting so
11 quick final question we we look in
the course at some of the public quality
metrics that the Indiana health
information exchange posts through their
quality health first initiative are you
doing that sort of thing here and what's
the reaction to from providers to that
idea if you are doing it so I think that
we have not been so public yet I think
that it that that too is a progression
coming back to really needing provider
buy-in and so we're presenting that data
to providers on their groups not not at
the provider level yet even and that's a
real challenge with regard to 2n anyway
but we are presenting that to the group
of practices that are participating in
the patient-centered medical home
initiative where they can actually see
their performance relative to their
peers and other health care settings but
that that's you know what's purported
publicly at this point is the aggregate
all of those programs relative to the
non patient-centered medical home data
that's available in the state so it's
it's it's a process well thank you very
much for the same time to be with us my
pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
