approach I think you're ready to do a
lot of really interesting things in text
learning there's one more representation
that I want to teach you before we quit
though because it's really really cool
it's called the tf-idf representation t
f stands for term frequency ID f stands
for inverse document frequency and the
rough idea is this the term frequency
part is very similar to the bag of words
what this means is that each term each
word is going to be up weighted by how
often it occurs in a document just like
it is in bag of words if you have a word
that occurs 10 times it's going to have
10 times as much weight as a word that
occurs only once the inverse document
frequency part is new though and the
idea here is that the word also gets a
weighting this related to how often it
occurs in the corpus as a whole in all
the documents put together and here's a
quiz to make you think about this
weighting in a very careful way the
question is this what do you think makes
more sense if you want to be extracting
information from these words will you
give a higher weight to the very common
words that occur in many many documents
or would you give a higher rate to the
rare words the words that might only
occur and let's say 10% or 1% of the
documents that are present in your
corpus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
