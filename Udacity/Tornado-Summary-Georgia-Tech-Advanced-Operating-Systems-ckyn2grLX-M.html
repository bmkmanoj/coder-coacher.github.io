it's an object oriented design which
promotes scalability the idea of
clustered objects in the protected
procedure call is mainly with a view to
preserving locality while ensuring
concurrency and we also saw how
reference counting is used in the
implementation of the objects so that
you don't have to have hierarchical
locking of objects and the locus of
locks held by an object is confined to
itself and it doesn't span across
objects or its replicas that's very
important because that's what promotes
concurrency and that also means that
careful management is needed of the
reference count mechanism to provide
existence guarantee and garbage
collection of objects based on reference
counts and multiple implementation are
possible for the same operating system
object now for instance you may have a
low overhead version when scalability is
not important and then you might decide
that no this particular operating system
object I'm experiencing a lot of
contention for this I want to go for a
more scalable implementation of this
particular operating system object so
this is where incremental optimization
and dynamic adaptation of the
implementation of objects comes into
play and the other important principle
that is used in tornado is optimizing
the common case I mentioned that when we
talked about page fault handling that is
something that happens quite often on
the other hand destroying a portion of
the address space because the up the
application does not need it anymore
that is called region destruction that
happens fairly infrequently so if it
takes more time that's okay so that's
where the principle of optimizing the
common case comes in and no hierarchical
locking through the reference counting
mechanism and limiting the sharing of
operating system data structures by
replicating critical data structures and
managing the replicas under the covers
is a creeper property in tornado to
promote scalability and concurrency
