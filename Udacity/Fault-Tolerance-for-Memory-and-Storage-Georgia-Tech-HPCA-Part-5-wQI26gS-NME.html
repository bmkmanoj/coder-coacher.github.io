fault tolerance techniques now let's
look at the for tolerance techniques for
memory and storage we could use dual
module redundancy or triple modular
redundancy for memory and storage but
they are considered to be overkill for
these devices we can get better
techniques that protect us from similar
problems so do a module redundancy and
triple modular redundancy are typically
used for the hardware that does the
computation which cannot be protected by
some of the less expensive techniques
that memory and storage can benefit from
and these techniques for memory and
storage are called
error detection or error correction
codes so the idea is that we can store
bits with some extra information that
allows us to detect and/or correct one
or more bits of error depending on the
code so we don't have to store
everything twice or everything three
times in order to achieve detection or
correction of a single error so the
simplest technique that is often used
for memory and storage is parity with
parity we add one extra bit to the data
bits and that extra bit it can be
computed simply as an XOR of all the
data bits when we do have parity if a
fault flips any one of the bits
including the parity bit the parity bit
will no longer match the data by
flipping one of the bits we are changing
the result of this XOR to be the
opposite of what it previously was so
when we read the data and the parity and
we see that now the parity does not
match data we assume that there has been
a bit flip and that's how we detect a
single bit error the next level of error
detection and correction codes is the
so-called ECC which stands for error
correction code and a typical example of
this would be a type of code called SEC
dead codes or single error correction
and double error detection code so this
code can detect any one bit flip and
actually fix it or if there are two bit
flips we will find out that that
happened but we can no longer fix it
using this code an example of where this
type of
is used is indeed a modules that have
ECC this is how they are protected so
pretty much if there is a single bit
flip in such a module you don't even
notice everything functions well if
there are two errors in the data that is
protected by the same code then we will
get notified that it's been an error but
we cannot actually continue operating
normally because actually we cannot
correct the error or inner state anymore
hard drives
use even fancier codes such as the
reed-solomon codes that I'm not going to
go into here and these codes can detect
and correct multiple bit errors and
they're especially powerful when we have
a streak of red bits which happens for
example when the head oscillates a
little bit and while the disk is
spinning it for a while just is too high
above the platter and misses some of the
bits and then for hard drives in
addition to these error detection and
correction codes there is a family of
techniques called raid that we will look
at next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
