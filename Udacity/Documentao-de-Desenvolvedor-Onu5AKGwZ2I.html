end of the course you probably feel
proud of having accomplished your goal
and I've reward yourself with ice cream
or a new video game well that's what we
did anyway inevitably you will have
questions while developing your
million-dollar baby and you probably
won't come back to the course to answer
them so where should you go our team of
developers technical writers and other
awesome folks keep all of the Google
Maps API is reference documentation
walkthroughs sample code and other
useful tips on our developer site we've
linked to it a bunch of times throughout
the course and there's another URL in
the notes below in the web area of the
site you find most of the information on
the JavaScript API that we presented in
this course you can drill down into the
reference section of the documentation
for each API to get the technical
details on all the classes methods and
objects we've used there's also plenty
of sample code you can view that look
suspiciously similar to some of the
examples we've seen in the course in the
web services section you can see
information on the services we've
demonstrated through HTTP requests you
can drill down into each individual
service to get the details on the
request parameters and responses you can
visit the Android and iOS sections of
the site to learn more about
incorporating the Google Maps API s into
your native mobile applications most of
the features are similar to those that
we've covered for the JavaScript API in
this course there's also a great faq
which should be your first line of
defense for questions on the Google Maps
API s the FAQ also has sections on
understanding the Terms of Service
quotas and usage limits and identify
errs like API keys if you have a
specific coding question we encourage
all of our Maps developers to use Stack
Overflow to post questions and
contribute to solutions if you are or
looking into becoming a premium plan
customer remember some use cases require
that there's a great online resource for
information on the premium plan this
includes things like terms of use quotas
and rates support and SLA and tips and
tricks for using your license finally if
you enjoyed this course there are some
great channels for more information on
the Google Maps API s for example the
Geo developers blog
and our Google Developers YouTube
channel linked in the instructor notes
well it's been a great journey but now I
have to go back to New York and get back
to my real job working with developers
using the google maps api is I have to
go home to my new baby luckily I mapped
it and it'll only take me 957 hours to
walk home but I couldn't avoid fairies I
think I'll probably rollerblade back
home thanks for taking the course how do
you happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
