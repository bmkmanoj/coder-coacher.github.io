thing that we're looking for is the
design of the patient self and so we won
the dog treated correctly treat present
in the beach content elements there we
want to see use of semantic tags
wherever appropriate and that there's a
grid layout used in your mock-up ok so i
guess i would start with the first part
of this which says the Dom tree
correctly three presents
mhm that provided oops sorry provided a
big round 3 presents the page Condon so
what is it on treatment so it's
essentially a document object model is
nothing but arm it's an in-memory
representation off your HTML page
provided to you
so what it is is it's like a tree
structure and it ranges all these HTML
elements hierarchically arm so that's
what it's doing and I could actually
show you guys how you can represent our
a dom tree so if you see I have a very
basic HTML document our HTML document
that has a head and the head has a title
followed by the body which has nothing
essentially for now and then I close the
HTML tag so how do i represent this arm
code in in the form of a tree so what
you do is you have the route followed by
the parents and the siblings and it's
child so the HTML is the root element in
the Dom tree followed by two siblings
are so to chart children sorry
r which is the head and the body so
these are essentially siblings the head
and the body are siblings there are the
child after HTML element and then
followed by the head has another child
which is the title on and then the title
it has a string that is the life of the
beach yeah the title of the page and
and the body just has come on stream
content which is the body so as you can
see this is how the donkey is formed so
however if you represent your page if
you called in your HTML document and
then draw make a drop the Dom tree out
of it it should both of them should make
sense so you should be able to mark the
Dom tree to energy and more document and
then map HTML document to the Lord
really I'm so we need that to be
appropriate that's what we are by the
first part i'm moving on to the next
part as it says page elements use
semantic diamonds were appropriate and
this also gets covered a little bit in
your in the associated class that's
right but definitely look up semantic
tags what are semantic times what are
non semantic tags
I and have a you know equal like a
healthy mix of both are definitely
wherever required if you feel like you
and you need to make use of semantic
times
go ahead and do it and non semantic tags
are just disney yeah so um something's
up so you're doing is just creating an
invisible box around the content when
you put inside your diff arm so that
goes as a non semantic element on
whereas your header footer on your
articles all of our singer caption yeah
because they are exactly represent what
element you are going to be putting into
your file so those are semantic tags so
i'll beat that just make money with the
airport
mhm but see you're adding a caption to
your figure you would want to have a big
caption bag which cement its adding
meaning yeah do what it what you are
writing and invite an easier for you man
I tree exactly and it's it's only very
appropriate it's not where we ask you
and I even called your page with
semantic tags here we do need an equal
makes a very like something that India
something that is appropriate for your
HTML page so yeah and the design uses
grid-based layout principles and this
again can be a great that you before you
don't necessarily have to use bootstrap
although using bootstrap is going to
make your life so very kind of mean and
yeah and you learn more about frameworks
as you go through the matter what
they're just most of the times just make
your life easier that's true but if you
don't want to get practices just loading
up your own dreams
go ahead and do that we also check for
responsiveness with the Buddha portfolio
website and I responsive we just what
responsiveness stands for is being able
to view your your page in a usable
manner on different types of devices the
ones we check for is a small screen
device in the form of the google nexus 5
tablet we check it on an ipod and
general laptop so there and again you
want to add bags and appropriate with at
what you want to change the layout of
your pages in in your project but a very
easy way to visualize what things would
look like it's been using developer
tools on your google chrome and the way
to access that we're going to start
bringing my screaming and I guess just
yeah a little fun is yeah absolutely so
I love my rubric open right now and
let's check out Udacity is
responsiveness
so you want to go to that hamburger by
yeah and then what I do is I go to more
tools and click on developer tools on
taking awhile but it's there so if you
instead instead of using the mouse when
you use your keyboard on a madness on a
Mac you would go with demand shift and I
together and windows or I believe even
on linux you would go with ctrl shift
and I together
yeah and then as you can see you can see
a lot of tabs opening up of that shows a
lot of code and console logs
but let's see ok so i do you see this
little novel yeah device i'm going to
click that
so what it does is it come it
automatically changed arm you know and
your screen site have to unload these
yeah and as you can see the device tab
shows you all the devices that you can
check your of the page with so I'm going
to check the google nexus 5 and then
what I'm going to do is it's showing me
an error that says you may have to
reload your yeah you might need to
reload your page for proper user-agent
so I'm going to reload this page
oops ok and that's the way you're going
to see it on a mobile yeah and then i'm
going to shift to an apple I that device
and see how it is
oh I like this you better uh-huh so ya
i'm going to reload again to see how
it's rendering on an iPad and yeah this
is how it looks on an iPad so and it's
as easy as this to actually use on to
the google developer tools to actually
you your responsiveness of your website
and I think all the developers all the
course developers all the coaches
believe that start designing for smaller
devices first and then logically arm to
just talk to two tablets and desktops so
always think about smaller devices when
you are looking you know coding in your
web page there are more things like four
in the first of which is separation of
concerns by that we mean we want to
check whether you have completely
separated your style which is CSS from
the structure or the HTML and we want to
do this
honestly just avoid confusion you you
want to have that separation between
style and structure and moving forward
you learn that it's an industry standard
you do that so that's right you want to
add anything to that problem and
therefore perfect
yeah good enough and it's very
straightforward and the doobly-doo
bricks so does your structure is your
hate
the mall and your style is your CSS so
yeah just make sure they are in
different files and they don't get list
i know that there are a lot of ways to
actually put in CSS inside your HTML
just by adding your style tags are your
script tags for your JavaScript inside
your head on element and that's not
usually about best practice because you
are reading CSS format code at the
beginning and then you shift to you know
history FML two elements all of a sudden
and it's just like to see it's not very
pleasant it's not very you know properly
organized and that's why you we want you
to separate it into different files and
always remember to have like a hierarchy
in your directories that you create so
have a CSS directory where all your CSS
files go right now for this project you
might have only one CSS and one HTML
file i know JavaScript files but it's
always always cleaner to c chord which
is properly structured so you have CSS
folders and CSS files going there jazz
folders yes I'll go miles go in there
images folder very your images is going
and then in your root directory you have
only our index dot HTML or whatever the
hegemon file you name it that's yeah I
guess the biggest chunk of both these
projects is the gold quality and what we
check is whether the gold passes HTML
and CSS validators and is formatted in a
way as stated by the Udacity issuer and
CSS style guide and we basically the
statewide was level of based on industry
standards so we want you to get started
with good habits most of the rules on
the style guide are pretty on
straightforward there are some things
which are very important and which you
might not understand while getting
started
it's very difficult to detect those I'm
so I guess we would arm get started with
telling them how to detect these sort of
armed and mistakes in their code and
these are formatting mistakes nothing
logical write your code might work fine
might render grade on the web page
because it's very smart web pages are
very smart they can the main character
type of yes they can render with
mistakes like even if you don't close
tags or some sometimes they would render
right but there is are a lot of things
that are missing in your formatting
style in that might be uncaught
sometimes and that's um I can understand
that that totally happens to all of us
and it's these rules help us understand
you know where we can do better and
writing code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
