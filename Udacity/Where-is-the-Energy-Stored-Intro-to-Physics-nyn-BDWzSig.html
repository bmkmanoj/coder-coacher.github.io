previous example we had three charges 2
+ + 1 minus and we want to know well is
the energy stored in the charges somehow
in the space between and the answer is
that the energy is stored in something
called the electric field now the
concept of a field is a strange one so
don't worry if this is an intuitive at
first we actually could have talked
about this concept of a field when we
talked about gravity so for example if
you look at the earth we can draw these
imaginary arrows pointed towards the
center of the earth and these arrows
somehow indicate what will happen if i
put a mass near them so if i put a mass
near this arrow well it will feel force
in the direction that the arrow is
pointing these arrows are somehow
representing the gravitational field the
electric field is very similar in the
same way that gravity is caused by mass
electric fields are created by charges
and just as gravitational fields are
felt by mass electric fields are felt by
charges so both created and fell by
objects with charge interesting now how
are we going to measure the electric
field well must have some strength
associated with it the way we measure
that strength is by putting a small test
particle of charge let's say plus Q
somewhere and if there's an electric
field this object will feel a force
electric fields cause forces and of
course if this charge were bigger the
force would be bigger but but it seems
like there's something more fundamental
going on and the force on this
particular charge so actually what we
want to do is to find the electric field
in the following way as being equal to
the force but we / whatever the charge
of the particle we're putting in is so
if we found that there was some force in
this direction that means they must have
also been an electric field in this
direction at this point so it's a quick
example of how to use this equation e
equals F / q let's say we take our plus
1 Coulomb charge set it down somewhere
and note that it feels a force to the
right of for Newton's well the electric
field is just force overcharge for over
1 and both of those numbers are positive
so in this case the e field electric
field would be for Newton's per cool and
maybe I'd want to say something like to
the right because electric field is a
vector has
both the size and a direction now what
if i gave you a different problem let's
say i have a negative charge that when
placing the certain electric field feels
a force of 10 Newtons to the right can
you feel this out for me can you tell me
what the strength of the electric field
is and that strength should be a
positive number and can you tell me
whether it's an electric field to the
right or to the left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
