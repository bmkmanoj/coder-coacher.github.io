awhile ago will now have a closer look
as at this matrix as promised so what we
just found out by the way is that this
part here anything you can do on a
non-deterministic Ram in polynomial time
can also be done on a deterministic Ram
in exponential time so any problem that
is in this part down here would also be
in this part up here but since we're
mainly interested in polynomial time
let's focus on the bottom part of this
matrix for now we'll come back to the
full matrix in later units when we talk
about exponential time complexity
classes and remember that each of these
squares contains all of the problems
that can be solved in polynomial time
left one on a deterministic Ram and the
right one on a non-deterministic Ram and
now we'll give these names so we'll call
this complexity class here P because
those are all problems that are solvable
in polynomial time on a deterministic
Ram and we'll call this here NP because
those are all problems solvable in
polynomial time on a non-deterministic
Ram of course it would have been more
consistent to call this one down here DP
or something like that but this is the
way we named it and now what we also
know is that any problem that can be
solved in polynomial time on a
deterministic Ram can also be solved in
polynomial time on a non-deterministic
Ram we should probably draw the redraw
those black lines here like this because
any problem that is contained in P is
automatically also contained in NP but
of course not vice versa
otherwise we would know that there's a
polynomial time algorithm for vertex
cover and the two other problems so P
contains all the problems that we know
are easy so for example finding the
shortest path between two points in a
graph or looking up an entry in a
database multiplying two numbers and
thousands of problems more so basically
any algorithm you'll have come across in
an introductory algorithms course will
fall into this category and again
there's some theoretical nitty-gritty
regarding optimization and decision
problems here but
we can ignore that for the time being so
let's do a little quiz to summarize what
you know by now so given all you've
learned what can you say about P and NP
so I would like you to check which of
these statements are true the first
segment is every problem in P is also
contained in NP the second statement is
that every problem in NP is also
contained in P the third one is that P
and NP are in fact equivalent the fourth
one is that it seems like NP should
contain more problems than P or be
larger than P but we can't really say
for sure
the fifth one is that vertex cover
independent set and clique are contained
in P and the final one is that those
three problems are contained in NP so
please check every statement which given
what we know by now you should consider
to be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
