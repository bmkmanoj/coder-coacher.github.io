the distributed data structures that GMS
has in order to do this virtual memory
management across the entire cluster
first thing that GMS has to do is to
convert a virtual address which is a
local thing so far as a single process
is concerned and convert that virtual
address into a global identifier or what
will call as a universal ID and the way
we derive the universal ID from the
virtual address is fairly
straightforward if you think about it we
know which node this virtual address
emanated from IP address we know which
disk partition contains a copy of the
page that corresponds to this virtual
address that we know what is the inode
data structure that corresponds to this
page and what is the offset so if you
put all of these entities together you
get a universal ID that uniquely
identifies a virtual address this is the
offset within a page so given a virtual
address the first three parts uniquely
identify the page and the fourth part
identifies the offset within that page
for that virtual address and this we can
derive it from the virtual memory system
as well as a ubc there are three key
data structures PFD GCD and p.o.d these
three data structures are the workhorses
that make this cluster wide memory
management possible let's talk about
each one of these things PFD is like a
page table normally in a page table what
you do is you give it a virtual address
and the page table says oh I know what
is the physical frame that backs this
particular virtual address that is the
translation between a virtual page
number and the physical page frame that
hosts that virtual page is contained in
a page table similar to that this PFD
it's called the page frame directory it
has a mapping between a new ID because
your virtual address has been converted
to a UID given a UID it says what is the
page frame
at beck's that particular uid that's
this data structure because we are doing
cluster wide memory management the page
itself can be in one of four different
states it could be in the local part of
that node and if it is in the local part
of a node then that page could be a
private page or it could be a shared
page these are two possibilities if it
is living in the local part of the
physical memory of a node if it is in
the global part we know by definition
global part is only hosting clean pages
so the content of global cash is always
going to be private pages and so the
state of the page that happens to be in
the global cache of a particular node is
guaranteed to be a private state and the
last possibility is that it's not in the
physical memory of a node but it is on
the disk so the page frame directory
just like a page table says that either
this page that you're looking for go
from viedo uid that page is in physical
memory and it is one of these three
states or it's not in the physical
memory it's on the disk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
