input is a password this box is the hash
function whatever computation goes on
here is going to happen here and output
this fast food could be any line could
be a passphrase that combines a bunch of
words letters digits whatever it is but
it produces the hash value is of a fixed
length in this direction we said it's
one way so it's easy to go it's easy to
compute this function given this input
and for us to produce this output if you
just had this and wanted to invert it go
in the other direction that's going to
be really hard which is the basis of
what we're talking about here given that
we're going to derive something from a
password using a hash function and store
that let's talk about a couple of
threats because of the security of
mindset we have any time we sort of make
a decision we want to think about it
security implications so what are some
threats we are going to assume that the
one way property of the hash functions
holds you make some assumptions so we
are going to assume that inverting or
going in the other direction from a hash
value to the password we're not going to
worry about that let's say we are
talking about common passwords you know
that password is a common password or 1
2 3 4 5 is a common password but this
hash function is known this one way punk
hash function we're talking about you're
not doing security by obscurity so it's
known we can compute the hash values of
a common passwords and we are saying
these hash values is stored by the
system those are the derived values if
you can get hold of the hash values the
system has and if you can find the hash
values for the common passwords among
those stored values it's not hard to see
how we can find out passwords of certain
users in the system so if the hash value
for one two three four five matches with
the stored value we know that users
password is one two three four five the
other kind of attacks we can mount one
is called a dictionary attack so it's
like a dictionary has lots of words
think about a long list of passwords a
dictionary of possible passwords words
and maybe they are mutated in a certain
way you add a few digits or something
like that but you have this whole
a sub passwords of the diction of your
passwords and you can try sort of brute
force each one of them that's called a
dictionary attack and offline attack is
one where we not interacting with the
system we're not trying to log in each
time we try a different password if you
do that then you are that's called an
online attempt we are making we are
interacting with the system so when you
do an online sort of guessing attack the
system can stop you after a certain
number of tries it locks you out so to
avoid that problem we can sort of
offline in our free time we can take the
hash values take a dictionary and sort
of compute for each dictionary word the
hash value and and search for that in
the set of hash values that we have when
we find a match we know a password and
we can do this as I said you know
without interacting with the system we
interact with the system only when we
discover a correct password so those are
called offline attacks and dictionary
attacks sort of brute force attacks are
one thing even when we store derived
values in particular hash values here
these kind of attacks are always
possible common password the hash values
dictionary or offline attacks the
assumption here is that that hacker does
have access to the hash values the hash
values don't immediately allow him or
her to find out the password you know
they can try different or try to guess
the password that match and when they
run into a match with a hash value then
they know for sure that this is the
password so these are kind of attacks if
possible even when you only store hash
values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
