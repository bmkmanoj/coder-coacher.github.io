record for got a CD you you can try this
at your own command line by typing for
example dig wwg edu now there are some
interesting things to note in this trace
here is our query and you can see that
this is an a record query here's our
answer you can see that the answer
actually has a cname in it which
basically says well you asked for got
checked out edu but in fact what you
really want to ask for is tl web GTM
contacted edu so then we issue an a
record query for that name and we
ultimately get the IP address these
numbers here indicate the time to live
or the amount of time in seconds that
the entry can be stored in the cache
here's another example of a DNS lookup
for nytimes.com the interesting thing to
note here is that in response to the a
record query we see two IP addresses
this is typically performed when a
service wants to perform load balancing
so the client could use either one of
these it might prefer the first one but
if we issued the same query again we
might actually get these IP addresses in
a different order now again here you can
see the TTL value which indicates how
long these a records can be stored in
cache in a subsequent example we'll look
at other query types that have much
longer TTL values here's an example of a
query for the NS record of got a CD u
you can see this output by typing dig NS
got a edu you can see here in the
question section now instead of an a
record query we have an NS record query
and our answer is a bunch of NS records
that are DNS 1 2 and 3 gitex an e of
which could answer authoritative lis for
subdomains of got a edu you can see that
in addition to the answer which returned
the name servers we also need the IP
addresses of those name servers which is
returned in the additional section of
the answer you can see here that we
received not only a records for each
domain name but also quad-a or ipv6
addresses corresponding to each
authoritative nameserver here's an
example of a query for an MX record or
the mail server
corresponding to Gothic dot e-d-u now
here again you can see the question as
the MX record and you can see the answer
which returns two mail servers as well
as the additional section which returns
an a record indicating the IP address
corresponding to the mail server that
was returned in the MX record in
addition to the TTL we also have some
metrics that indicate priorities that it
would allow a system administrator to
configure a primary and a backup mail
server in this case the mail servers
just happened to have the same priority
level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
