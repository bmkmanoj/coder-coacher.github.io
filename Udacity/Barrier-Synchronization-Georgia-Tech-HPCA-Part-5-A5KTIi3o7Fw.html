often eat in programs is called barrier
synchronization this often occurs when
there is a parallel section where
several threads are doing something
independent of each other for example
each thread is adding up the numbers in
its own part of a shared array
eventually we want to know the total sum
so what needs to happen is we need to
make sure that everybody has finished
their own adding up and that's what a
barrier is and only then somebody for
example thread zero can actually form
the total sum and for example print it
out we don't want it to print the sum
before we know that everybody's
contributions to the sum are complete
another thing that can happen is that we
are computing the sum in this parallel
way and then all of the threads need to
use this sum so again all of them need
to wait for the Sun to be certainly done
and only then can they proceed to
actually use the sum if thread 0 starts
using the sum before making sure that
other threads are done computing the Sun
then what happens is we are using the
sum that may not include all of the
numbers that are in the array same for
any other thread so the barrier pretty
much is a global weight that ensures
that all threads have entered the
barrier before any of them can proceed
past the barrier so the barrier
synchronization ensures that all threads
that need to arrive to the barrier have
arrived before any can leave the barrier
a barrier implementation can have two
variables a counter that counts how many
threads have arrived and the flag that
gets set when the counter finally
reaches n so what each thread arriving
to the barrier needs to do is increment
the counter check if the counter is
equal to the number of threads that need
to arrive if it is equal set the flag if
it's not equal that means we are not the
last arriving thread then we spin
waiting on the flag to finally become
set of course things are not as simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
