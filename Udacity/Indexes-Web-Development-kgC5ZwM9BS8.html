IDE we've been doing what are called
sequential scans and a sequential scan
is where you have a list of something in
our case links we have this list of
links that have have these IDs you know
link 1 link to link 3 and we've been
doing things like find the link with the
ID 2 and so which case we you know write
a loop to you know go over the list and
find the one who has ID 2 or you just
eyeball it by hand and answer your quiz
just by writing in the answer by hand
which is actually totally fine because
you went through the same process you
have to look through this whole list of
links by hand now that works fine if you
have 25 links but if you have a million
links or a billion links you know
iterating over that entire list is going
to take some time and you know we want
to make our websites fast or at least
reasonably responsive so that's going to
be troublesome so I'd like to introduce
you to a new concept called indices now
an index is just like an index in a book
it makes they make lookups faster when
index you're probably familiar with
already is the hash table so in Python
you can have a dictionary that looks
something like this
that you know it is a mapping like a key
to a value let's assign this to a
variable we'll call this just index now
you can do very fast lookups in your
code by writing something that looks
like this which will refer to you know
the index key to of this hash table and
when you do a hash table lookup you
learn this in cs101 we hash this value
we find it in the in the hash table and
then we return the key we don't have to
or we return the value we don't have to
scan over every element in the list and
see if it matches our constraint we can
jump immediately to that element and
that makes queries run much faster
ok so let's play around with this in the
IDE a little bit and see what we can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
