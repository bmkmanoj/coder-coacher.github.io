going to start by opening a browser and
playing a song so previously I googled
to find out how one would open up web
browser and Python and I discovered that
there is this function called web
browser open this function takes in the
link I want to open I just pasted a
YouTube address in there in fact this
could have been any link you want all
right let's save the program and run it
I'm going to call it break time pi PI
stands for Python to run it I will click
on run and then click on run module now
my hypothesis is that when we run this
program it will open the youtube link
let's see oh it seems like we have an
error okay it says there's another new
program gol whatever that means while
scanning the string literal okay
oh look python is pointing at the error
it seems like I missed the closing code
so I'm going to add that let me save the
program one more time and run it now I
believe it will work hmm another adder
you know when I first learned how to
program I felt so intimidated by these
errors look at them they are red and
in-your-face but to make the program
work we have to somehow get past them so
would you mind reading the error and
telling us what you think is the problem
with this code enter your responses in
