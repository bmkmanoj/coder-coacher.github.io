restarted for all kinds of reasons like
failed liveliness checks readiness
checks a command and this leads to a
problem what happens if we want to
communicate with a set of pods when they
get restarted they might have a
different IP address and this is where
services come in instead of relying on
pot IP addresses which change
communities provides services as a
stable endpoint for pods the pods that a
service exposes are based on a set of
labels if pods have the correct labels
they are automatically picked up and
exposed by our services now the level of
access a service provides to a set of
pod depends on the services type
currently there are three types there's
cluster IP which is internal only
there's type node port which gives each
node an external IP that's accessible
and then there's type load balancer
which adds a load balancer from the
cloud provider which force traffic from
the service to nodes within it okay it's
time for you to learn how to create a
service and use label selectors to
expose a limit set of those pods
externally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
