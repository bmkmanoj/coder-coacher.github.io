because we already have a way of
measuring it in gallons intelligence is
a construct how do we measure and define
intelligence we have the IQ test or
maybe we could measure intelligence with
grades but grades may also help us
measure something like how hard we're
working like effort effort is a
construct we might measure effort by how
many minutes we spend working on
homework or by grades or GPA age is also
a construct if I had put age in years I
would have defined age as the number of
years you've been living but some people
might look at age as how mature you are
here I didn't put a way of measuring it
and age therefore this kind of tricky
would be considered a construct in this
case so maturity age in years and wisdom
are all three different ways you could
possibly measure age hunger is also a
construct hunger could be measured by
how often your tummy grumbles or by how
a deficient in nutrients your body is
annual salary in u.s. dollars is not a
construct that's because we put in US
dollars and therefore we have a way of
measuring your annual salary and finally
itchiness is a construct how would you
define and measure itchiness I'll let
you ponder that one yourself we have to
think carefully about how to define and
measure constructs the descriptions for
constructs that we settle on and that
allow us to measure them are called our
operational definitions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
