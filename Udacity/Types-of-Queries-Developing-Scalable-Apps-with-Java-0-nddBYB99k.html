you use data store queries and we will
start by giving you an overview of the
types of queries that we will run let's
do that by looking at conference central
where we will build out the show
conferences function in the first tab
here we can see all conferences this
query is called query by kind because we
will search for all entities which are
of the conference kind in the second tab
we can see all the conference's created
by the user this query is called query
by kind filter by ancestor because we
will search for all conferences that
have the user as their ancestor remember
this is the ancestor relationship we
established between the conference and
the profile that created the conference
and finally in the third tab we will see
all conferences the user has registered
to attend this query is called query by
kind filter by property because we will
display all conferences that are in the
attended conference property of the
profile entity remember this is too has
a relationship we created between a
profile and the conference's they
register to attend and one more thing in
this part you can further restrict the
search result by applying filters and as
you can see from the drop-down menu
these are properties in the conference
kind so therefore these will also be a
query by kind filled to buy property
okay so these are the query ties we will
look at now query by kind query by kind
filter by ancestor query by kind filter
by property the query by kind filter by
property is a little bit advanced stuff
the other ones are pretty
straightforward though so you'll start
off by adding them to conference central</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
