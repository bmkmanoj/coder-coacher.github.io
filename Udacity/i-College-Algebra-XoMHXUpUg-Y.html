all other numbers I to the zero power is
just equal to one this may seem a little
bit funny because one is a real number
but i think this is more testament to
the fact that I and all other imaginary
numbers are in fact numbers I the first
power is just I i squared is i times
itself which means we're multiplying the
square root of negative 1 times the
square root of negative one that should
just give us negative 1 now i cubed is
going to be i squared times I so we have
negative 1 times I which is negative I
interesting so we only have one and eyes
the positive and negative versions over
here let's see what happens in this
column I the fourth should be I to the
third times I again that means we're
multiplying the square root of negative
1 by itself and then taking the negative
of that number so this is negative
negative 1 which is just equal to 1 oh
that's funny that's the same as I to the
0 I to the fifth is I to the fourth
times I so 1 times I which is I again
that's the same as I to the first and we
can see the pattern continues for I to
26 and I to the seventh so it seems like
when we take powers of I the numbers
that they're equal to alternate in a
cyclic way we go from 12 I to negative 1
2 negative I back to 1 and so on I think
this pattern is really interesting and
keeping this in mind is going to help us
remember the relationship between real
numbers and imaginary numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
