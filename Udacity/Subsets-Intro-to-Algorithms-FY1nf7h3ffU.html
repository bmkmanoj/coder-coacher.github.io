about planar graphs and trees first
thing to note is that not all planar
graphs are trees for example here is a
ring which is a planar graph and it's
not a tree so plenty graphs are not a
subset of trees on the other hand all
trees are planar graphs for most trees
it's fairly intuitive to see how it
could be drawn in the plane for example
this one is already a planar but for
other trees it might not be so obvious
that we can rearrange everything to lay
it at flat in a plane and so it'd be
nice to have a proof that all trees are
planar instead of replying just on
intuition one way to prove this is to
show that any tree can be drawn inside
of a triangle and then larger trees can
be constructed by combining these
triangles more formally what we want to
show is that any tree can be drawn in a
plane inside a triangle with any given
note at the apex of the triangle and so
for the base case of one node we can
draw the node at the apex of the
triangle and this is trivially in a
plane and so for our inductive step we
assume that the claim is true for all
graphs with less than n nodes and we
want to show that the claim is true for
all graphs within nodes so we'll start
with a tree with n nodes we use this for
example we're gonna pick any node kind
of at random we'll call it R for example
we'll have this node be R and then we
remove our because our original graph
was a tree this separates the graph in
two separate disjoint trees and now
since each of these trees have less than
n nodes we can draw each one inside of a
triangle first we can take this tree of
four nodes and draw it inside of a
triangle
notice that the node that was connected
to R is at the apex of the triangle and
then we can do the same for the other
two trees and then in our last step we
make a bigger triangle and we put R at
the apex and then connect it to the
apexis of the other triangles so this
verifies our claim and shows that all
tree graphs are planar they're
definitely either due to the definition
of trees a tree can have no cycles and a
ring must have a cycle the answer is
neither right
never got a really specific definition
of a chain besides just the example
which was a knock but yeah same idea
kind of a chain doesn't have a cycle
where is a ring a ring does I mean the
other thing we got definitely was that
the edges in the chain is the number of
nodes minus one and the edges in a ring
is equal to the note therefore there can
be no crossover between them there
really well is there trees but not all
trees are changed so it's the first one
it satisfies the definition of a tree
graph that it's connected but there's no
cycles and then the other description of
a tree graph that every pair of nodes in
the graph has a unique path between them
I mean it chain does that also this is
definitely one that answered Twitter Lee
just by looking at examples is gives me
a hundred percent confidence and making
that claim yeah and I just kind of a
quick example of that's a tree that is
not a chain so right and either in the
way I convinced myself of that this
drawing in an example of a hypercube
that was not a ring and a ring that was
not a hypercube
as long as you'd have a ring that's
anything but for note it's not a hybrid
loop okay and any hypercube that's
anything but for Noah's is definitely
not a ring okay true so yeah I'll draw
one for you yeah and just the normal
cube all right
our second-to-last problem is uh just
grids and chains all chains or grids but
not all grids are changed so it's the
chains are upset at bridge I mean any
chain within notes is a 1 by n grid once
you get a grid that has more than one in
either the two directions it's no longer
a chain and no matter how long you make
a chain yep
so this is an add a note to a chain I
know what in it for chain that makes it
more in kind the first thing you said we
have a like a 1 by n grid and it's also
a chain but yeah yeah this is for
example not a chain correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
