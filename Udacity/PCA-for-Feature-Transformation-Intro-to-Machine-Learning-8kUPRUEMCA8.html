PCA generally does and I want to take a
step back and talk about it as a general
algorithm for future transformation so
remember what we started with was four
features that we manually split up into
two categories we said square footage
and number of rooms are related to size
and the safety in schools are related to
the neighborhood then we applied PCA to
each of those independently and we came
up with that single feature then we can
put those features into say a regression
and come up with a house price you could
also imagine that these would be good
inputs for a classifier if you're trying
to answer some slightly different
question but there's a little bit of a
problem here and maybe it's been
bothering you and that's this step right
here that we manually took our input
features and we used our human intuition
to figure out how we should group them
and the problem with this is that this
manual process is not scalable let's
suppose we're trying to use PCA for
something like facial recognition where
the inputs might be thousands or tens of
thousands or even millions of pixels in
a picture there's no way that we could
inspect all of those pixels by hand and
try to split them up according to what
we think might be the combinations that
make the most sense and then apply PCA
to each of those individually but here's
the magic of PCA I can take a second
strategy with this what I can do is I
can put all four of these features into
PCA together and it can automatically
combine them into new features and rank
the relative powers of those new
features so if we have the case where we
have two latent features that are
driving most of the variation in the
data PCA will pick those out and it will
call them the first and the second
principal components or the first
principal component the one that has the
most effect might be something like
neighborhood and the second principal
component might have something like
sighs it's a little bit harder to make
these interpretations now because what
can and does happen is that the first
principal component will be an admixture
that has little bits and pieces from
potentially all of the features but this
is a very powerful unsupervised learning
technique that you can use to
fundamentally understand the latent
features in your data if you knew
nothing about housing prices at all
PCA would still be able to give you an
insight like there are two things that
seem to drive the house of prices in
general it would still be up to you to
figure out that there the neighborhood
and the size but in addition to
doing dimensionality reduction now
you're also learning something
fundamentally important about the
patterns of the variation in your data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
