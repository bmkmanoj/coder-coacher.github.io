that are shaded out of 16 total for 16
is the same as 14 I can think about
moving these three pieces over into this
region by move this one here this one
here and this one here i'll get one
triangle just like i have over here this
is what it would look like for the
circles i have two out of three circle
shaded so two thirds on this side i have
one two three four five six pieces
shaded out of three six nine so I know
two thirds is the same as six nights I
could also think about moving this piece
over here and moving this piece over
here and I'd have two full circle shaded
and one circle left empty it would look
like this okay on this one I know I have
two pieces shaded out of six here i have
four pieces shaded out of 12 I know 26
is the same thing as 4 12 I can think
about shading this piece and moving it
here this one here and this one here
that way I'd have to 6 and 4 12 what's
also interesting is that both to 6 and 4
12 it's really one out of three or
one-third these are all equivalent
fractions for the last one I have three
out of seven pieces and in this last one
I have 6 out of 14 pieces so
three-sevenths is the same as 614 nice
work on that quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
