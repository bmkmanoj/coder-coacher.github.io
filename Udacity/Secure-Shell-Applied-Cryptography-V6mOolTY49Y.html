about is SSH which is the secure shell
protocol the problem SSH is trying to
solve is also a client server
authentication problem that we have a
client who wants to log in to a server
and to log into the server the server
asks for the password and the client
enters what we want to know is that when
a client's connecting the server that
they're connecting to the server they
think they do are and that an attacker
who can intercept and modify this
traffic won't be able to trick the user
into giving its password to a different
server or thinking it's interacting with
a different server this protocol is also
based on diffie-hellman and uses aspects
of both symmetric and asymmetric
cryptography so the first step is very
similar diffie-hellman in fact it's the
same the client picks a large random
number and sends to the server G to that
power mod P and G is the generator P is
the modulus just like in defeat Hellman
the server picks its own large random
value we'll call that X s and computes
YS which is G raised to that power so
far this is the same as the
diffie-hellman protocol and then the
server computes the key which is y see
the value transmitted here raised to the
XS power so far this is all the same as
what's done in diffie-hellman just
change the names of the variables to
match the client and server the next
step is where things get interesting
what the server will compute is a hash
so we'll use some cryptographic hash
function and the inputs to that hash
function first there's be some
parameters that identify the protocol
those will be concatenated with the
public key of the server we're assuming
at the start of the protocol the server
has some public private key pair and so
what will be included in this hash is
that public key public key of the server
the value of YC that was sent by the
client that verifies that it's part of
the same session prevents replay attacks
because now that value was determined by
the client the value of YS this is the
normal difficulty
note that this is all in a one-way hash
so someone who intercepts that hash
won't be able to learn anything about
the inputs someone who knows
we'd be able to verify that the hash is
correct and so what the server sends is
the value of its public key the value of
YS and the hash signed with the server's
private key so we think of that as
sending the hash along with the hash
encrypted with a private key that's what
it means to do a signature in asymmetric
cryptosystem so for this quiz I want to
see that you understand the SSH protocol
at this stage the client and the server
have a shared key the question is what
should the client do to verify that the
server's indeed the server that the
client expects it is talking with check
all of the choices that are necessary to
verify this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
