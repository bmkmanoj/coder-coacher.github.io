has operated only on numbers and in the
early days of computing people thought
of computers as super-powerful
calculators for doing computations like
simulating nuclear weapons computing
ballistic tables or breaking encryption
which was a little more than just
arithmetic but still was mostly about
counting and doing simple arithmetic we
saw this quote from Grace Hopper earlier
talking about computers could only do
arithmetic and this is what people
thought about computers in the 1940s and
1950s but there's no reason to limit
computers to that they can operate on
any kind of data we want and it gets
much more interesting when we operate on
data besides just numbers if we're gonna
build a search engine
most of the data we want to deal with is
not numbers it's the letters that are
contained in webpages and in Python
that's what we call a string a string is
just a sequence of characters surrounded
by quotes so here's an example of a
string in Python it starts with a single
quote has a sequence of characters and
anything we can type on the keyboard can
be in a string and ends with another
single quote the string is the sequence
of characters between the single quotes
if we want we can use double quotes
instead if we use double quotes then the
double quote starts the string we can
have a sequence of characters and a
double quote that ends the string the
only requirement is that if we start to
string with a single quote it has to end
with a single quote if we start the
string with a double quote it has to end
with a double quote and that's actually
a handy property because that means we
can have the other kind of quote within
our string the string starts with a
double quote it contains a single quote
inside it but because we started with a
double quote that single note doesn't
end the string that single quote is just
like another character in the string the
string continues until the closing
double quote so let's try some things in
the Python interpreter so we can print a
string just like we can print a number
so here I'm printing the string hello
and when we run this we see the output
hello it's printing hello we don't see
the single quotes as it prints but we
know that it's a string that was printed
we can print a string with double quotes
and one thing to notice when you enter
strings in the trip return
the color is black now since it's an
open string it hasn't been finished once
I type the final quote that closes the
string the color changes to blue so now
when we run this we have two prints both
that print hello it looks the same both
times it doesn't matter if we use single
quotes or double quotes around our
string just to check everyone's paying
attention I'm going to try one more
thing
and now I'm printing hello without the
quotes try to see if you can guess what
that will do we won't make a quiz of
this but try to guess before I run it
now that I run this we see the result we
get a name error the name hello is not
defined without the quotes this looks
just like a variable it's a name but
it's a variable that we didn't define so
when I try to use it I get an error that
the variable name hello is not defined
if I wanted to I could define a variable
name hello let's make Hello refer to the
string howdy and now when I print hello
it works I see the first two prints that
printed hello now when I print the
variable hello well that refers to the
string howdy and I see howdy is the
result we usually don't want our
variables to start with capital letters
that's just a convention so I'm going to
change this back to a lowercase hello
because it makes me feel uncomfortable
to have a variable with a capital letter
there's no rule against that in Python
it's just a convention that we like to
follow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
