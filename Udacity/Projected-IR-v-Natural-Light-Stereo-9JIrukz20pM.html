versus a natural light one of the
advantages of this projected light or
projected ir well yes it works in
low-light you're not counting on having
external light you're not counting on
having texture that you can deal with
since i'm projecting this texture and
it's okay if I've got repeated things
because I'm it's not actually repeated
in a speckle pattern remember we had
this problem with picket fences and
stereo of all the pickets look alike to
know which picket it is is a challenge
well if you painted all the pickets
different colors or different speckles
that's not a problem and that's what the
connect does and in particular you can
tailor your algorithms to the actual
pattern that you're producing an
engineer the thing to work really well
what are the advantages of natural light
well it's natural light so it works
outdoors it works in sunlight works you
know it just works whenever it's going
the lights are turned on doesn't work in
the dark that's okay neither do i but
the idea is that you know you're just
basically using the scene the other
thing is you don't have to worry about
the resolution of your projection you've
got the whatever your high resolution
sensors it's a lot easier to build high
resolution sensors than high resolution
projectors both of them have some
difficulties um you know they if you
have various shiny surfaces right or
specular surfaces like a mirror right so
your projections gonna go and you know
clearly if I'm doing stereo and I'm a
robot and I'm looking at a mirror I see
the thing that's up there and I think oh
I could just reach down here and get
that light that's on this oh no okay it
actually it doesn't see the table and my
projector well it projects down so it'll
also be thinking about the ceiling
alright so it doesn't work you need of
those cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
