get pretty good occupancy in general how
do you affect the occupancy of a kernel
well it's usually fairly easy to control
the amount of shared memory needed by a
thread block for example in our
transpose kernel that would be the tile
size and of course you can change the
number of threads and thread blocks that
you launch when you launch your kernel
you can also work with a compiler to
control the number of registers that
kernel uses that this qualifies as a
ninja level optimization and isn't
usually worth the trouble so increasing
occupancy is usually but not always a
good thing and it only helps up to a
point it exposes more parallelism to the
GPU and allows more memory transactions
in flight but it may force the GPU to
run less efficiently when taken too far
this is always a trade-off for example
decreasing the tile size and the
transpose code will let more thread
blocks run it decreases the amount of
time spent waiting at barriers but if we
get too too small a tile will lose the
whole point of tiling which was to
coalesce the global memory accesses so
let's go back to that transpose code so
here's our kernel and you'll recall that
we concluded that this sync threads was
really the problem we need it there but
we've got a large thread block 32 by 32
threads 1,024 total threads and most of
the time most of those threads are
simply sitting at this barrier waiting
for the rest of the threads to reach the
barrier before they can proceed so we
conclude that maybe we can make this
faster by simply going up and changing
to 16 by 16 blocks a very small change
that should decrease the amount of time
that we spend waiting at a barrier and
therefore decrease the latency between
memory operations which by littles law
we would expect to let us increase the
total bandwidth so now we'll compile and
run and sure enough this time we took
just over point 5 3 milliseconds so
let's update our running tally of
results the tiled version of our code we
managed to get at about half a
millisecond by adjusting the tile size
so here's a programming exercise let's
go back to the transpose code and try a
few different tile sizes and see which
one's work best try 8 by 8 16 by 16
32 by 32 and 64 by 64 tiles this last
one will be trickier because of course
this is more elements than you can put
threads in a thread block so you'll have
to think about how to pack this into a
single thread block and I should point
out we're looking for the relative
ranking of these on the Udacity servers
so using the fermi based GPUs as opposed
to for example your own machine that you
might be developing on at home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
