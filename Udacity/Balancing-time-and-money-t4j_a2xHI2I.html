important to find a balance between the
time and resources you have available
have a look at this scale on one end is
the resources you have and on the other
is the time it takes to complete your
goals you'll need to find the right
balance on the scale to manage your time
and resources effectively so what
happens over here if you're not careful
how you use your time you can end up
trying to do everything yourself this
could save you resources but it forces
you to focus on daily tasks rather than
the growth and stability of your company
in this situation you probably need to
go out and find people with the right
skills to help you build your business
now what happens if you don't manage
your resources effectively there are
many ways you can run low on resources
but here's one example maybe you've done
a great job building your team and have
plenty of time to work on growing your
company while building a great team is
necessary over extending your resources
can become unsustainable and cause other
problems for your business in this
situation you may need to cut back on
the resources you're spending by
managing a few jobs yourself or finding
cheaper ways to get it done your goal is
to stay somewhere in the middle if you
can find a way to manage both your time
and resources effectively you build a
much better foundation for your business
to grow on coming up you'll learn to
manage this balance as we go through
each of the options you have for your
business keep in mind how you plan to
balance your resources with the time you
have available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
