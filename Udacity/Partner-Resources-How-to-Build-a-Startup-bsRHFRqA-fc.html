obviously if they have something you
need that you normally would have to
develop and they would sell to you were
licensed to you that allows for you to
get to market faster or it might be a
complementary product or service then
you just couldn't afford to build or
won't get around to for a while and that
allows you to offer a broader product or
offering or yes you could do it and you
could probably do it at the same time
but why do something that's their
expertise with your money it might just
be easy to buy their product integrate
it in yours and now all of a sudden
you're no longer doing their invention
but focusing on your core business and
for startups trying to understand what
it is you want to focus on versus what
is it you could acquire in terms of
activities and resources and suppliers
it's a real strategy partnerships are
not kind of an add-on they really allow
you to capitalize on the unique customer
knowledge or expertise of others and
final reason is they might be channel
partners or they might be partners
overseas to new markets that you weren't
planning to get to this year or even
this decade and it allows you to
generate a source of income that would
be unavailable to you for years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
