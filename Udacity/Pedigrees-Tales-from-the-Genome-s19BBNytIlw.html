those relatives with whom you're most
genetically similar let's say your
parents and your brothers and sisters
this doesn't mean that your closest
relatives like your parents or siblings
share every trait that you have in this
diagram that we've constructed up to
this point doesn't do a very good job at
revealing which family members share
which traits right we're not doing a
good job of showing the relatedness of
particular traits now to combine this
sort of family tree with the information
about traits that we're interested in
understanding we're going to use a very
special kind of diagram called a
pedigree now pedigrees are just an
organized way of looking at family
relations and traits females are
symbolized with just a simple circle
symbol and males are symbolized with
just a square a single line drawn in
between a male and female does not
indicate marriage I repeat does not
indicate marriage it simply indicates
that there were sexual relations and
align coming downwards and then
splitting into any number of more
circles and squares simply indicates the
number of children and whether or not
they were sons squares or daughters
circles and each new generation in the
pedigree gets its own row so here we
have the children the parents the
grandparents the great-grandparents now
none of this is probably really unique
to you from our family tree that we were
looking at before because we've got the
relatedness of the family the genetic
relatedness right we can see the tears
the organization the male female aspect
of it but what we're missing or trait
relationships and this is where
pedigrees become immensely useful
because not only are these shapes
indicative of something about this
individual the fact that they're male or
female but we can also shade them in to
indicate whether or not the individual
has a particular trait or not so let's
use an example the trait of lactose
intolerance something we learned about
in the last lesson lesson for now the
way this works is we want to represent
the trait of lactose intolerance using
our shading mechanism if an individual
is in fact lactose intolerant we want to
shade that individual shape the circle
or the square and if they're not lactose
intolerant if they're lactose tolerant
right they can actually
just no products then we're not going to
shade the circle at all we're going to
leave it empty it really is that simple
so let's try to build a pedigree for a
particular individual concerning this
trait of lactose intolerance meet Kate
Kate and her family have a European and
Jewish ancestry kate is in fact lactose
intolerant but her brother is not
neither of Kate's parents are lactose
intolerant either but her maternal
grandfather and paternal aunt are
intolerant remember maternal grandfather
means the grandfather on her mother's
side and paternal aunt means the aunt on
her father side using all of this
information I want you to tell me which
of the following categories represents
Kate's family and the trait of lactose
intolerance not only one of these five
pedigrees can be right and the only way
you'll be able to figure it out is if
you understand what the symbols mean in
the pedigree and what the shading means
hopefully this isn't too hard and go
ahead and give it your best shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
