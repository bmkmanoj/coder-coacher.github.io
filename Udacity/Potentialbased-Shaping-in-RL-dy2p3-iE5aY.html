going to be this instead of giving
little bonuses for good things happening
what we're actually going to do is put
bonuses on states of the world then when
you achieve a certain state of the world
you get that bonus and if you unachieved
that state of the world you lose that
bonus so everything kind of balances out
nicely so we'll write down an equation
for that in a moment but let's see if we
can think about what state-based rewards
might look like in the context of this
little soccer example we were talking
about ok so the reward function the
official reward function has us getting
a plus 100 for scoring a goal but we
wanted to give hints we wanted to give
hints to the system for getting near the
ball hitting the ball getting the ball
near the goal so we need to do that we
need to define that now in terms of the
states of the world so what would be
what would be some appropriate rewards
that we could put in for that well I
mean they're days I think they would be
very similar to the ones that we were
talking about before right if you're
talking about States you want to be in
the state of the ball moving towards the
goal or the ball being near the goal or
you moving towards the ball or kicking
the ball those are all states would like
to be yeah ok all right so yeah so and
the way that we were writing that before
I think was something like 1 over the
distance between us and the ball and one
over the distance between the ball and
the goal but now we should be think of
these as being bonuses that are tied to
the state not not values that we're
getting for becoming close to the ball
so there's always this this this value
this potential that's keeping track of
how close we are to the ball and when
we're close to the ball it's a big
number and when we're far from the ball
too small number and the reward that
we're going to get is as we change from
state to state how much more potential
have we gotten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
