talks talks about where these different
things are on the page or actually
what's on the page CSS is the where and
the how does it look
yeah pretty much and the JavaScript is
like how does this whole thing together
how does when I click this what
machinery does that enact to make that
happen right yeah so if you wanted a
static page you could just have the HTML
CSS and you wouldn't need JavaScript
like a blog or something yeah okay but
if you actually want to be able to
interact with things you can have some
interactions with HTML alone but if
especially if you want things to to move
without reloading the page you basically
you want to use some JavaScript and this
together I mean I've heard the terms you
know front end back end this is the
front end of a web page yes so this
doesn't really have it back in there's
no sending information back to a central
server or anything like that this is all
run on the client computer which means
me yes so when when you load the page
all of these all of these assets get
loaded into your browser you you
basically download all of these files
and then it just goes on your computer
okay there's there's no talking back and
forth it's all it's all there right so
good it's helpful hey I have never had
anyone just explain this to me before so
with the index like HTML I did have a
hard time when I was you know browsing
this at first I don't know HTML and I
was it was confusing so maybe we can
talk a bit about how to how to read this
sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
