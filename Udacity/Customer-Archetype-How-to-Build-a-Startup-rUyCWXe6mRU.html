talking about the customer let me remind
you what it looks like from their side
and we'll be talking about customers in
more detail in the next lecture but let
me just give you a preview in customer
segments you are also looking for three
things one is you are still trying to
understand from this side what are the
gains what are the pains but also what
are the jobs the customers want you to
do what are the functional or social
jobs what are the emotional jobs one of
the basic needs that you're going to be
solving or problems and the goal of all
this is not just to understand this but
to understand it in enough detail that
you could actually draw the persona or
archetype of those customers and put
them on the wall of your engineering
department because now they could stare
at faces that you'll clip out and
inspect of how old they are where they
live what job they're trying to get done
and what pains and gains your value
proposition is trying to solve for them
and until you do that you're just going
to be making products in the dark</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
