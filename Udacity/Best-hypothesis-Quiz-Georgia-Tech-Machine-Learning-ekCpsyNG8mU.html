Michael I want to do a quick quiz just
to make certain you really get what's
going on here the sort of power of
looking using Bayesian learning the the
main insight I think I want to drive
home here is something that you said
which is that when we were doing
regression before and we were talking
about perceptrons we actually had in our
head a particular kind of function a
particular hypothesis class and here
with what we've been talking about with
Bayesian learning the answer of finding
the sum of squared errors was
independent of the hypothesis class and
only dependent upon the key assumptions
that we were making namely that we had
labeled eighth of a certain form and
that that data was generated by a
process that took deterministic function
and added some Gaussian noise to it so
here's the quiz here's your training
data you've got a bunch of X's and a
bunch of D's these are the values that
you have to learn and I want you to tell
me which of these three functions over
here these three hypotheses is the best
one under this assumption got it maude
can we allowed to do that we are allowed
to do that because it's just a function
it's just a function man interesting
just a function so we've got a linear
constant function a linear function and
we talked about those but we've also got
a mod function right and you're and
we've got a uniform prior over these
three hypotheses yep okay yeah I think I
can do that okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
