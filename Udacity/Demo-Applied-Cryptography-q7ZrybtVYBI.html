security research labs in berlin Carson
has done a lot of interesting work on
breaking real-world crypto systems
including the GSM crypto system is used
protect mini mobile calls and SMS
messages so he's gonna give us a little
demo that and that explain how it works
I'd like to start with a motivating
example of where this has been applied
cracking mobile phones the 2g part of
the phones we still use every phone
today still a 2g phone in some way even
though 3g and 4g now have been added to
it and breaking this of course allows
you to snoop in on messages phone calls
may allow you to put charges on somebody
else's phone and may may allow you to
track them for instance right if it's
really getting a lot of trouble for
misusing those powers yes and we
certainly want to stay away from that
today which is where we're only breaking
this phone my phone and then we want to
show is intercepting a text message sent
to this phone so something that is
delivered to the phone in an encrypted
form the encryption function from 20
years ago but some of these are still
solid desk for instance Triple DES
anyway however this one turns out to be
weak and how we will show now for this I
need a way of intercepting the phone
communication with another phone so of
course every phone can record phone
traffic usually they would record
traffic sent to their own number now if
you slightly reprogram it it will just
record traffic send to any number or
whatever number you specify to stay in
the legal cycle will make it just
intercept traffic of this one other
phone today and this and a little bit of
theory that learned today is all that's
needed to intercept a text message okay
so you see these blue lines these are
all attempts of the cell to reach phones
for whatever reason and those are we
don't want intercept then now you see
the red lines this is
when it started sending data to the
right phone of the one where we say who
said I sounded to only look at data that
sent to the right account number we
could have put any number just leave it
out to intercepted you know that that
would put us on the wrong side of the
law and you see after just over two
seconds it found the correct key it also
would showed the from number we blank
this out here did come from England
though right interesting service you're
using that and of course the texture of
the SMS so the actual secret right all
of this can be cracked in less than
three seconds apparently well we are on
this data let me let me briefly show you
what actually was exchanged between the
iphone which which will be interesting
later to see what whitis was crackable
particular we'll ask the question why
was this predictable in heart SMS
terminal message is exactly you're
intercepting any detail I guess what
they are that's um ciphering which okay
the old word for star encryption right
then everything below here is encrypted
however a lot of dis shouldn't be
encrypted at least it's not secret for
instance the GPRS data connections are
switched off while you receive an SMS
fairly this phone is not supposed to
also do data connection so just one
second then the cell introduces itself
as saying I am the cell that uses all of
these frequencies it did that as well
before you see up here exact same
message but unencrypted and here's the
bottle I say I'm very pretty very
predictable because they give it the
once encrypted and once not then the
phone response hey I measured our
communication and I measured you to be
this far away this is for for tweaking
set parameters also not very secret
because probably the measurement report
didn't change much from before the
encryption he goes on to to exchange a
few empty packets in GSM you have to say
something and certain time slots and if
nothing to say can you say that you're
less interested or exactly it is are
just County and again it measures again
empty empty empty empty and again the
cell introduces itself and again it
measures and again in empty and an empty
frame and only now the actual SMS as
exchange was that from number was boost
the text I won't go in there so we don't
see the from number the phone
acknowledges the message as being
received so these are the only two
messages that are actually really needed
and only one of them should really be
encrypted the cell again introduces
itself as if the connection wasn't over
yet and again the phone measures there's
a couple more empty messages the cell
says please stop using this channel we
are done and just in case the phone
hasn't gone away at sense more empty
encrypted messages and now this this is
all the decrypted traffic after you've
decrypted it but before decrypting it
you had a pretty good guess of what was
in it I just have one frame with the
message precisely so each predictable
messages gives us some attack surface
that we can exploit using methods that
we want to discuss my great well let's
share about how you actually exploit
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
