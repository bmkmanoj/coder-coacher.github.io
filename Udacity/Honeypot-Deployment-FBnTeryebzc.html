of locations on a network a honeypot
outside the external firewall is useful
for checking attempts to scan or tag the
internal network the main advantages of
placing the honeypot at this location
are that first of all it does not have
any side effect second since it attracts
and traps attacks to the honeypot it
reduces the amount of traffic in
particular the attack traffic to the
firewall therefore reduces the amount of
alerts produced by the external firewall
on the other hand honeypot at this
location does not trap internal
attackers a honeypot can also be placed
in a DMZ to charge attacks to the public
facing servers on the other hand a
honeypot at this location may not be
able to trap interesting attacks this is
because a DMZ is typically not fully
accessible that is other than the well
defined public facing services no other
services are supposed to be available in
DMZ that is even attacker is attempting
to access the honeypot and a service is
not one of these well-defined popular
facing services the firewall is going to
block the traffic what if you say let
the file allow the traffic to the
honeypot but this would mean that we are
opening up the firewall and this is a
security risk we can also place a
honeypot in the internal network
alongside with servers and workstations
the main advantages here are that you
can catch internal attacks you can also
detect a misconfigured firewall
therefore words impermissible traffic
from the Internet to the internal
network on the other hand unless we can
completely trap the attacker within the
honeypot the attack may be able to reach
other internal systems from the honeypot
in addition in order to continue to
attract and trapped the attackers to the
honeypot we must allow his attack
traffic from the Internet to the
honeypot this means that we must open up
the firewall to allow the attack traffic
to come from the Internet to the
internal network and this carries a huge
security risk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
