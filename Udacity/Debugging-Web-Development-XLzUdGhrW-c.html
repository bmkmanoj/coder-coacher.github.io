function if we get content back from
that URL we run this code now I don't
have the return statement here because I
want to change this just a little bit in
the quiz I had you return lat calm along
what I want to turn here is a DV g 0
points which I have learned is a part of
google app engine and it's the data type
for storing a latitude longitude we
could just store a couple here I figure
if Google gives us a data type
specifically for a location that's what
we should use so I'm going to use one of
these and that's what we're going to
return out of our function let's test
that this function is working quick way
we can do that is let's just toss in a
line right here we're going to say self
dot right repper get cords self the
request that remote etter what I've
added here is just a quick little hacky
thing in our get function first we're in
this could call this function right
which if you recall i added up here and
it caused self dot response that out
right so i don't have to type so much i
can just say dot right we're going to
call rapper now this is a handy little
trick when you're printing python
objects in HTML because when you print a
Python object it has angle brackets
around it which HTML will the browser
will interpret as a tag and then it
won't actually print what you're trying
to print so if you put wrapper around it
you'll get some extra quotes and it'll
print properly then I'm just going to
call our function get courts and i'm
going to call it with the requesting IP
address which is found it's the remote
adder attribute of the request object
and i learned how to do this just by
looking in the App Engine docks in
almost every web frame if you have
access to the requesting IP I knew what
I was kind of looking for and just found
out in docs so let's give this a shot ok
so i reloaded the page and I see none up
here that's better than an exception we
didn't get a location so let's do some
investigating first thing I want to do
is I want to see what the actual IP was
so we can kind of the bug the service so
let's say self dot right well print the
IP as well let's give that a shot ah ok
127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 that means we're
running this locally so it's not
surprising that a service on the
internet doesn't know what our local IP
is let's verify that will go to their
API will put in the API by hand when
we'll run it and yes it's a private
address for those of you who don't know
every machines local IP address is one
700 that one this is called the loopback
address and this is how a machine refers
to itself it's not a public IP address
on the internet localhost what we're
accessing here generally refers to that
IP let's cheat a little bit and see if
we can fix this this is something that's
going to come up during development for
our period here i'm just going to
overwrite the IP we send in this
function to be an IP that I know is real
for dot to dot to dot to this is a big
name server that helps you resolve DNS
names into IPs and we'll just hard code
the IP and this function to be this for
now so we have something actually test
against let's go back in our browser
give this page a reload and see if we
get anything useful aha so we are now
seeing the coordinates of that IP
address where that machine is located or
at least where this free service claims
that machine is located which is fine
for us you know we're not trying to be
too accurate here we just want to draw a
pretty map ok so our get IP function is
working we also conveniently tested the
error case which you should always do so
we're in good shape there so under those
hacks and let's check back to our to-do
list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
