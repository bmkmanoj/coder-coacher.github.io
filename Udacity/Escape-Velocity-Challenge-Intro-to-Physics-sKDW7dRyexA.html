and it's not a challenge from them
because it's particularly mathematically
difficult rather the concept is really
tricky to understand we're going to be
talking about escape velocity and what
is escape velocity well to understand
this let's imagine a rocket on the
surface of the earth so first let's
imagine that this rocket takes off with
a very small speed it's not going very
fast then you can imagine that gravity
pulling on the ship will cause it to
slow down and fall back down to earth
even at greater speeds it might take off
finally come to a stop and then fall
back towards Earth and this makes sense
because the force of gravity is always
pulling on the rocket in fact no matter
how far away the rocket is from the
earth the earth will always be pulling
on the rocket so if we draw a force
diagram for our rocket we see that the
only force acting on it is the force of
gravity pulling it back towards Earth so
no matter what speed the rocket is going
it's always accelerating back towards
Earth and since it's accelerating back
towards Earth the rocket is always
slowing down so it makes sense that at
some point it comes to rest and then
falls back to earth even though this
rocket is always accelerating towards
Earth in fact is always slowing down
it's actually still possible for the
rocket to escape the earth forever and
never be pulled back down to just keep
going away from the earth forever that
seems like a strange idea if it's always
slowing down how can it avoid stopping
completely well let's find out so the
answer this question actually lies in
this formula for gravitational potential
energy that we just discussed now if you
remember our discussion of potential
energy in the unit we discussed how we
can always set our potential energy to
be zero at any point we want as long as
we stick to it so in fact this formula
could have some constant added on to it
to make it so the gravitational
potential energy was zero at a specific
location so let's be smart and picking a
good choice for what we want the zero
potential energy point to be so I'm
going to choose a point really really
really far away from the earth to be
where my gravitational potential energy
is equal to zero it just so happens that
this choice for a potential energy zero
point happens to be when K equals zero
and let's see why so as we get further
and further away from the earth are the
distance from the rocket to the earth
gets bigger and bigger and bigger which
means this value continues to get closer
to zero and the only time this value
ever gets to be
zero is when R goes to infinity at some
point really far away from the earth so
that's why we don't actually need that
constant k here to get that same effect
okay but that doesn't really explain why
i chose the zero point to be off at
infinity why wouldn't i choose it it
like the surface of the earth or
something else like that well let's find
out how choosing our 0.4 gravitational
potential energy at infinity helps us
reason about escape velocity now once
again we're going to tackle this problem
by using conservation of energy the idea
that the sum of the kinetic and
potential energy is the same at any
point in the problem so my starting
point I'm going to choose the original
rocket taking off point at which point
the rocket has some initial kinetic
energy and some initial potential energy
and for my final point I'm going to
choose the point when the Rockets
finally stops moving the acceleration
caused by the force pulling it back
towards the Earth finally causes its
velocity to reach zero so at this point
there is no kinetic energy alright so
now I want to consider a few cases of
what happens if the sum of the kinetic
and potential energy when the rocket
lifts off has different values first I
want to consider the case where the sum
is less than zero so if the kinetic
energy plus the original potential
energy is less than zero then we know
that the final potential energy must
also be less than 0 and this is great
because if we look at our general
formula for gravitational potential
energy we see that the value is always
negative because of this negative sign I
front so we should be easily able to
solve for R the distance the rocket is
away from the earth when its speed
finally reaches zero now what about the
case where the original kinetic energy
plus the original potential energy is
greater than zero well then in this case
the final potential energy must also be
greater than zero but this poses a
problem since this formula says that
gravitational potential energy is always
negative were in trouble how can the
final potential energy be greater than 0
and less than zero at the same time the
solution is they can't be so what went
wrong well to get to this point we
assumed that the final kinetic energy
was zero if setting the final kinetic
energy equal to zero leads to a
contradiction then it must be the case
that the final kinetic energy can't ever
be zero and what does that mean it means
that the rocket never slows down to zero
velocity so even though
it's always accelerating towards the
Earth it never slows all the way down
and falls back to earth and so if the
rocket never reaches zero velocity and
never falls back to earth we can say
that the rocket has successfully escaped
and that's what it means for the rocket
to have escaped velocity its original
kinetic energy plus original potential
energy is greater than zero and as you
might have guessed the threshold case
where the rocket has just enough
velocity to escape is when the kinetic
energy plus the potential energy is
exactly equal to zero awesome all right
now that you know this fact you're ready
to tell me what speed does the rocket
need to be going in order to escape the
Earth from the surface of the earth
what's its escape velocity in order to
solve the problem you're going to need
these constants the value of big G the
value of the radius of the earth and the
mass of the earth good luck finding the
escape velocity and if you're confused
about any of the topics I just discussed
please head to the forums and ask your
questions there I'll be happy to answer
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
