finest it's a much finer representation
of the data by pulling together multiple
data points into an individual bar you
can see that there's a much better way
to really understand the dependence of
cost to data and why the bar doesn't
give you the linear relationship in fact
in this case happens to be nonlinear it
really gives you a sense as you go up in
house sizes the cost increases which
wasn't obvious from looking at the
individual data points so what the bar
chart does it really helps you to pull
together groups of data into a single
bar and understand global trends such
global trends might not be that
important if you only have six data
points but imagine you have sixty
thousand with sixty thousand data points
your scatter plot
may look like this and I can tell you my
hand isn't really able to draw sixty
thousand points if you vote to look at
this data set the individual data tell
you very little jumping in X parameter
by a tiny bit might make a jump in Y
from here to here down to here to here
at some point down to here yet a bar
graph can really help you understand the
data so clearly one of the things that a
statistician does is to use cumulative
tools such as bar graphs to gain an
understanding of the underlying data so
let me ask you our bar charts cool just
check one of the two answers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
