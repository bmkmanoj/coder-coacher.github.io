with negative inputs negative inputs are
part of the domain of the function and
one of the basic principles of testing
is we should test computer programs with
values sampled from their entire domain
now sometimes as a software tester
you'll test code with an input that
looks like it should be part of the
domain and the code will malfunction it
will crash with some sort of a bad error
perhaps maybe not through an exception
but rather actually rather actually exit
abnormally and what you'll do is you'll
go to the developer of the function you
look go to the developer of the software
under test and you'll say I think I
found a bug and they'll tell you
something like well the input that you
tried is not part of the domain for the
software and that's usually perfectly
legitimate as long as this fact kind of
fact is documented as long as it's clear
to the users of the function then
restrictions on the domain of functions
are actually a very valuable tool in
practice because otherwise without
restrictions on domain every P every
function that we implement every piece
of software that we implement has to
contain maximal defensive code against
illegal inputs and in practice this kind
of defensive coding is not generally
possible for all internal interfaces for
one thing it makes code extremely slow
and for another thing it clutters up
code with error checks that make it
completely impossible to find the code
that's actually supposed to be doing
something so to reiterate domain
researchers are perfectly valid
technique for keeping code simple in the
case where these kind of assumptions
about an input domain are actually
reasonable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
