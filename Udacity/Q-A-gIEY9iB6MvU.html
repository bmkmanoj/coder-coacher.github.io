insights and related components any
advice okay yeah so PageSpeed insights
does sometimes give you these sort of I
guess vague problems about your website
they might just say you know illuminate
render blocking CSS or eliminate render
blocking JavaScript and then it kind of
gives you some hints on what that means
but it never really gives you a clear
guideline on okay go and fix this so I
would say the first thing to do is to
definitely read what PageSpeed insights
gives you as information about those
things then go back and look at your
code and see if you can pick out any
parts of your code that sort of match
with what they've described for example
if you have render blocking CSS that
means that you have see components in
your CSS that are preventing your entire
page from rendering so you need to go
and look at what particular you know CSS
script is the one that's causing this
render blocking you can kind of do that
by taking them out one out one at a time
or you can come up with some clever ways
to do that do you have any insights on
the best way to interpret and use
pagespeed insights during I mean yeah
that's great advice John it and if you
ever have a question about something you
can also google for the exact phrase and
you'll probably find a wealth of extra
pages on you know minimizing the
critical rendering path abisai in
addition to what you under the course so
that that never hurts in case your extra
curious but um a lot of times hopefully
it does refer to things new terminology
that you learned in the course but when
it doesn't certainly just go look it up
and see it's a fact okolona learn
anything are there can we look different
images with different compression levels
while using different devices with
different screen resolutions that I'm
you're taking responsive images and
wants to really optimize this the answer
to that is absolutely yes
can so it's a little trickier you'll
have to utilize you know CSS to serve
the appropriate images as opposed to
hard coating them in your HTML you can
also do it with JavaScript but I I
prefer using CSS to render those kinds
of images and then while using different
devices with different screen resolution
yeah you're going to have to look into
using media queries for that kind of
stuff and serving your images with media
queries and CSS in terms of actually you
know creating all these different images
for all these different devices and
different screen resolutions if you
haven't looked at the responsive images
course yet you totally should Cameron
breaks down how to use task runners like
grunt for example to to automate all
this and you don't have to sit there and
tweak a bunch images by hand in some
photo editor hoping that they're
rendered correctly different events on
the page that change the render tree
would cause a new layout of bent each
time we could increase our speed
supposedly supposedly by using batch
updates recording video yeah so Liam
what this means is the render you know
we can create these JavaScript events
that basically manipulate our Dom or a
render trick and the more times we sort
of call those events the more times
where you know rii accessing the Dom
changing something and then redrawing
the tree basically creating a new layout
of any time what they mean by batch
updates is you want to create basically
a function or some sort of methods that
do as much of this as possible without
accessing the Dom multiple times a good
way to do this is when you access the
Dom the Dom elements you actually put
those in a variable and then you
manipulate that variable that way you
only call the document object model once
and then you make all the changes you
want and then all the updates happen and
then the layout oven
happens because every time you call for
that you know you take a request from
the Dom it has to process all those
changes that have been made previously
and so you'll actually notice this in
the pizza page for example with the
moving pizzas in the background pay
close attention to how many times you're
actually accessing your document object
model because it's a lot and if you can
reduce the number of times that that you
know we're like that query selector is
selecting everything the faster your
page is going to look you'll be amazed
at how much faster too it literally goes
from a couple seconds to a couple like
milliseconds do we not care about frames
per second for page loading oh yes so
the thing is there are two fixes that
you have to do in your main.js file if
you had read the comments um Cameron has
given you that there are two fixes to do
in Maine yes and they are completely
pertaining how you scroll through the
page and how the pizza sizes changes and
how the background our pizzas move
around in the page so whenever you
scroll up and down you can see the
background pizza is moving um so that is
one area where there is a major fit
student carried out um so for this
project and for this particular solution
we are only looking for crawling over
the page up and down the page and then
reciting the pizzas um so yeah just you
should only like worry about that don't
be too all concerned about page loading</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
