that relates amount of one thing to the
amount of another thing and it's always
equal to our favorite number one and
we've already seen how to use a
conversion factor to go from number of
cartons to number of eggs and the
conversion factor we used was twelve
eggs divided by one carton but currents
and eggs aren't the only thing that we
can convert using a conversion factor we
can convert between units of distance or
volume or even money if we have the
correct conversion factor for example
let's look at yards two feet there are
three feet in every yard which means
three feet is equal to one yard in the
same way that twelve eggs was equal to
one carton but that's not quite our
conversion factor the conversion factor
is three feet divided by one yard and
this is equal to one since these
quantities are identical so let's
practice using one of these conversion
factors let's say that you need four
yards of ribbon I don't know maybe
you're having a birthday party or
something but the story you're in cells
written by the foot how many feet of
ribbon should you ask for enter your
answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
