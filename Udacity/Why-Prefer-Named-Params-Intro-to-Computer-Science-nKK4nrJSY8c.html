think are good reasons the first one is
not a good reason normally shorter code
is better than longer code the exception
is if you get paid by the line in which
case you might prefer along your code
this is why it's a bad policy to pay
programmers by the line of code the
second reason errors are actually a good
thing we much prefer to get an error
than to get unexpected behavior in this
case well if we use the wrong name we
probably would have got the behavior we
wanted but in general we want to program
defensively under the belief that
usually it's better to get an error then
get an incorrect result of course this
depends a lot on what we're doing and
often it may be better to write code in
such a way that the program survives and
keeps going instead of stopping with an
error so this is only usually true but
it's always a good idea to program
defensively the third answer is
definitely true one of our main goals as
a programmer should be to make our code
readable and maintainable this means
it's easy for someone else to understand
what we're doing and to make changes in
the code without breaking things this is
sometimes in conflict with making code
concise we do want on our code to be
short and generally the shorter the code
the better except we're making the coach
short makes it harder and harder for
someone to understand as a general
guideline if you're writing code that
you think if you came back to it a week
later you wouldn't understand what it
does that's probably a bad idea much
better to write the code in a simpler
slightly longer way than to do something
really clever to make it short</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
