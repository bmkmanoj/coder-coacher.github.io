years old i live in Austin Texas I took
warfarin for six months about three
years ago I had a blood clot probably
due to heavy travel there were no other
complicating symptoms or at least that
was what we surmised at the time now
when you say you had a blood clot that
you know to anyone who hasn't had a
blood clot before that sounds kind of
serious is that serious it is and it was
kind of an interesting I mean I'll tell
you the long version right it started
out I in retrospect probably for several
months I had some developing issues but
didn't really know it at the time but
looking back after after I discovered it
it became pretty clear that I had you
know it had these these symptoms and
just so we know what are those sometimes
well I was having um I was getting a
little bit lightheaded occasionally I
just thought it was from working out too
much or something like that right I was
a lot my ankles had started to swell on
long trips on aircraft which they had
never done before and so and I just
thought well it's inactivity well of
course it was but it was also that I was
having some of these other things you
know beginning to crop up in my or my my
veins or arteries whatever so anyway the
story is I was my wife and son were in
Colorado on vacation I was going to meet
them i flew to denver from austin i was
walking down the concourse in the denver
airport talking to my wife on the phone
going to my next gate because i was
flying to Vail and all of a sudden I
felt like I was just walking through
molasses it was amazing I just felt like
I was in slow motion and it wasn't even
vertigo it was it was you know but it
but I kind of thought it was okay
altitude you know
so I said to my life I have to sit down
I think I'm just you know the dinner is
getting to me in Denver so I went over
to my gate kind of stumbled over I guess
and I sat down and I put my head between
my legs and that didn't help and I just
crashed on the floor so you know then I
felt kind of woozy but I was you know
people were worried about me I got up I
was able to get on the plane and then
over the next couple days I felt fine so
no big deal I was there for a week I
then flew to Germany and I got to
Germany I felt fine my first night there
I went to went into a establishment with
a friend of mine to watch some soccer we
had a couple of beers walking out I we
hit the cobblestone streets and I
twisted my ankle a little bit the next
day in that same leg I had a very tender
spot on the back of my calf and I
thought well I must have twisted more
than just my ankle no big deal but it
felt really tender and the height you
know like I had pull a muscle for a
couple of days and then over time it
kind of went away so then a few days
later I flew back to Austin got home the
next day I had the same pain but it was
in my groin and you know it was late at
night and I said to my wife you know I
that's weird it's moved maybe I have a
blood clot I'll go to the urgent care
clinic in the morning so the next
morning I got up and it was big and it
was really tender and red so I went in
and you know the doctor took one look
and said yeah you have a blood clot get
get across the street to the radiology
group and we'll do an ultrasound so I
went across the street had an ultrasound
it was pretty clear during the
ultrasound procedure it was kind of neat
because you know they make you do things
like flex your ankles and on aircraft
you may have noticed there are
instructions and aircraft magazines
about moving your legs you know moving
your knees up and down or flexing your
ankles and they had a speaker on the
ultrasound device so i could actually
hear the blood flowing through my
veins as I flexed my ankles so those
exercises are there for a reason I guess
which I didn't know at the time so I
thought oh that's pretty cool so the
radiologist said it'll take me a while
to look at your chart go ahead and go
home I'll call you so I got five minutes
away literally from the clinic in my car
and the nurse called and said you know
come back so I turned around came back
and they gave me a heparin shot
immediately in my belly and what's
happened for heparin is a very
fast-acting clot basically brick I'll
call clot breaker I don't know exactly
the terminology but it dissolves the
clot and its rapid I mean it only took a
couple of days before the swelling had
virtually gone away and I took that for
10 days I had to take shots in my belly
which was really really uncomfortable
and then I started on warfarin after
that so ten days on heparin then I had a
sort of a ramp up into war from regime
and took warfarin for six months now I
guess in your case in particular it
seems rather even scary to some people
that some of those symptoms were even
kind of not benign but definitely
synonymous with other kinds of causes
right from and so your realization you
know that it was a blood clot seemed
rather important to getting it treated
in time before something worse happened
right well I you know I didn't really
know anything about blood clots I have
to say I wasn't educated about them at
all I a little better educated now of
course but at the time I really didn't
know anything once the pain move from my
calf to my groin I kind of you know
figured out oh wait a minute this isn't
just a muscle pull and it's really
tender I mean you I couldn't touch it
without it being pretty painful so you
know that was a little bit you know
muscle pulls don't really feel that way
when muscle pull if you you know if
you're really massage maybe okay but I
mean just you know light touch I could
feel it so it was something different
after you had the heparin treatment and
you
to sort of bust up the initial clot
right and the war firm was prescribed to
essentially prevent clots from forming
curl period of time in the future right
now is this a pill that you have to take
every day well first off is it a pill
and it's something you have to take
every day right it's a pill you take it
every day and I'm trying to remake aunt
remember exactly whether I actually took
more than one in a day to ramp up to
some level or not I don't remember but
it took about two weeks to determine
that I was stable on it that my my
clotting factors were at a normal level
and not varying a lot because that's one
of the things they look for so I had to
get you know blood tests every every
twice a week for two weeks and then
every week after that but it's a pill
and you know long-term over six months I
took it once a day and so obviously i
guess the concern is since the war in
itself modulates the clotting factors
and how effective and efficient they
work for you that too much warfarin
could be a bad thing absolutely so when
your doctor prescribed this for you what
were the considerations that went into I
mean did he have lots of special
instructions for you did he try to get a
lot of information from you did you have
to modify anything in your life going to
accommodate the dosing yes all of the
above he gave me some fairly they
weren't super detailed but fairly
detailed instructions I you know once I
discovered and had verified at the
doctrine that I had a clot and that I
was you know because these shots will
remind you of nothing else because
compared to the shots the warfarin
itself was not really a big deal for me
in terms of the you know the ingestion
sure the shots hurt they hurt for quite
a while after taking maybe 20 minutes I
would have to lie down and just try to
relax because I had such a massive pain
right in my belly where the where I got
the shot anyway the the warfarin was so
there were relatively detailed
instructions I had educated myself after
finding about the clot and so the doctor
you know more or less cursorily went
over the instructions with me rather
than go through them word by word
because he knew i had read them and had
begun to educate myself and i was lucky
because my personal physician was also
my next-door neighbor so he knew my
lifestyle and knew that i was going to
be you know pretty diligent about
understanding this you know this in
addition what were some of the special
exceptions we know that vitamin K is
really important rather the amounts of
vitamin K because vitamin K isn't a
central component for clotting right
well did you have to alter your diet or
did you have to pay special attention to
it yes so before and this is another
interesting sort of pre determining
factor I think not just the travel but I
ate a lot of leafy green vegetables
which have those are really the main
sources in our normal diet of vitamin K
for example iceberg lettuce doesn't have
much but Romain does right kale has an
enormous amount spinach I love spinach I
ate a lot of spinach before that so I
had to cut back and I really I didn't
eliminate them from my diet but I cut
way back and I did control very
carefully the intake so I I knew exactly
how much I was taking each day there
were some things I totally eliminated
from my diet for example avocados and
the reason for that is avocados you can
have two avocados that look the same but
yet one will have very little vitamin K
and the other can have an enormous
amount per unit weight so the the
variability was just it's something that
you know you would you just imagine well
I'm not going to eat those then right
because I don't want to inject that kind
of variable
the end of my diet I'm a big fan of if I
can control the control things through
my diet I'll be better off so I kind of
laugh once in a while and say I went to
meat and potatoes for six months the
opposite direction of what some people
end up having to do right and I and the
other thing that was a little bit
interesting to me and I and I don't
remember how important a factor this was
made out to be but I know I wasn't
supposed to get really overheated when I
worked out so don't really stress your
body out and you know because now you're
making your liver work pretty hard and
that's where the clotting factors come
from in your bloodstream right so you
need to be really careful about about
how you control your you know the energy
expenditure that your body goes through
so and I had a Mike lot occurred in
early July so in Austin july is the
hottest time of year so you know rather
than I'm not going to go outside and run
it new right because I'm not just going
to get super heated so that was a that
was a pretty substantial change another
change was it because you have to worry
about your blood you know maybe maybe
not being so maybe not being able to
thought so much anymore right i mean
warfarin has the effect of thinning
blood so right it doesn't clogs easily
but then the concern obviously that you
don't clot enough when you need to clot
right yeah so another thing i did was i
I had taken baby aspirin one a day at
that point and that's a different way to
thin the blood right as you get older
they kind of recommend that for your
heart but that's really I think that's a
platelet lubricity issue where as
warfarin is really about clotting
factors in the bloodstream which is a
completely it's a chemistry thing right
and so I stopped taking aspirin during
that time just because it was another
variable we wanted to eliminate so I
really changed my diet pretty
dramatically I went out and bought the
cumin and cookbook which was really
great for meat and potato recipes well
that sounds like just the diet and the
recipe
some people out there already right
exactly now were there any way besides
your diet any special activities that
you know you were precluded from doing
besides even you know like you said
exercising in the heat was there any
major concern about getting injuries or
or stopping bleeding if it were to occur
yes in fact when I had the weekly blood
test one thing I noticed right away was
that the bleeding did not stop just a
little pinprick and the finger is what
was needed to get the blood test taken
so you know you can usually just do this
with your fingers for 23 minutes and
then the blood will stop right but it
would take 30 minutes or more because
you know we were trying to keep my blood
relatively thin the other thing the
other lifestyle change for me was I like
to drive cars fast at the racetrack and
I couldn't do that anymore because of
the concern about blunt force trauma any
kind of accident you know if you have a
bad bridge you could you know
potentially bleed to death if your blood
doesn't clot well so you know that's
that's the kind of thing that you know
really was a big change for me no I'm
interested to sort of in the more
personal side I mean this is all very
technical and obviously things about
your life had to change you know from
the event of having the clot itself and
then of course having to go through like
you said the ten-day hepburn treatment
and the six months of warfarin right did
it have you no justice have a
psychological impact or a social impact
on you and your family oh yeah for me
personally I stopped traveling for about
six to eight weeks and then after that I
remember still the first aircraft I
gotta I was fidgeting and it was Austin
to Dallas you know literally a 35-minute
flight and then I went Dallas tin
Milwaukee so maybe an hour right not
very far I was fidgeting the whole time
just trying to keep my blood flowing I
mean it was it's it really changes your
attitude I mean for me it was my first
glimpse of mortality I did so I mean
that was that was a big deal
and I think also you know just having to
go through a dietary change for the
first time in my life and strictly
control my diet you know my attitude had
always been I'll eat as much as I want
anything I want I'll just exercise just
to keep my weight you know where i want
it it wasn't like that anymore so that
was a big change and you know it was a
big change for my family because now all
of a sudden if we were if they were
going to have kale or spinach I wasn't
so it was almost like we had to cook for
two different diets right so I mean and
just things like that I mean that was
that was part of it but I think also
there was probably some worry you know
from the other family members about you
know is that ok or my husband okay right
all right well you know there are
there's a lot of new information out
there about genetic variability in
certain genes that affect your
metabolism of warfarin right no we're
just curious do you know if you do know
of anything about your genetics with
regards to that sensitivity of war form
yet I do not know and I didn't know
there was a genetic and component so
that's good i'm gonna go study about
yeah um so and we'll just ask as a
follow up then so this is something you
would be interested in knowing about
yourself then in case you need warfarin
in the future right yeah and you know
there has been there has been a stroke
or heart disease in my ancestry you know
recent ancestry both sides of my family
father and mother I've always looked at
that and said well you know back then
people smoke blood and they didn't have
very good diets and I'm a much better
help than my father was at my age and
his father but you know it kind of makes
me wonder and I know there has been a
history of strokes on my mother's side
of the family in particular and of
course that's one you know one byproduct
of blood clots so I
a stroke so so overall you're pretty
pleased then that a drug like warfarin
does exist at all right obviously to
assist but you know this was a big sort
of life-changing event for you right if
you could you know talk to someone that
was either just diagnosed with a blood
clot and was going to have to go on
warfarin over a period of time or if you
were going to have to give advice to a
family member or friend of someone who
was going to have to undergo that do you
have any helpful or important advice or
opinion that you'd like to share with
them something that you think it's
important they should know about well
when i read about warfarin i thought you
know a couple things it's almost like
aspirin it was discovered quite a while
ago Miller in the last century and maybe
1930s or 20s it's amazing that such an
effective drug has not really had yet a
replacement that works kind of for
everybody you know what I mean that was
interesting to me because it has been
used really for other purposes than
treating blood clots before that at
first I thought I'm not sure I want to
put this in my body but it really wasn't
all that bad the actual ingestion of the
drug itself I really felt nothing and
you know I felt perfectly normal so that
was good and I think they're you know
don't fear right on the other hand for
me i stabilized rapidly and you know my
my clotting factor levels in my blood
state very constant over time maybe that
was just discipline so my advice would
be follow a diet you know be really
strict about your diet that doesn't mean
you know deprive yourself but but be
consistent with it so that your your
your body is being presented with the
same chemistry from nutrition I mean I
think that's really important the other
thing is that you know taking the drug
again is not
end of the world and if you're a typical
person who gets a blood clot you don't
take it forever I mean in my case you
know it was six months and I was off it
and that was you know that was four
years ago so you know I think but it but
it it does change your lifestyle a
little bit or maybe a lot I guess
depending on the you know the gravity of
the situation but it isn't the end of
the world well we're glad that you had
warfarin and then it works successfully
for you and that you're here to share
your story with us thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
