knowing what H is and then using that
for being able to now find a warp
between the two different images so
again let's take these two different
images here these two points that I want
to actually be able to model and of
course these two points are visible here
to achieve this first I need to create a
bigger space coordinate space like this
one then I can put this one here now I
know these two points are aligned you
can put this on top of each other that
way and of course this means that now
actually I've been able to align these
two images because I know where these
two points are force me to do a little
bit more we need to also do a little bit
of warning and interpolation something
we have looked at before to be able to
align this image with the other one
basically I need to find the fact that
this is the original image that I
actually have the transformations for
and then of course knowing this warp and
interpolation parameters I can now
generate a much cleaner image between
those two regions and that will allow me
to kind of create a much smoother type
of an image between those two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
