both curious and skeptical when you work
with data to help you get in this
mindset I want to share another
conversation that I had with ODE in this
next video I want you to listen to ODEs
work and look out for how she
demonstrated this exact mindset so we
gathered all the hometowns and current
CDs from the users and I was looking at
conditional probabilities given a
hometown what is the probability that
you currently live in each different
cities like for example even that your
hometown is New York what is the
probability that you live in Chicago or
that you live in that you still live in
New York or that you live in San
Francisco or Paris and so on and what I
was expecting is that at least the most
likely city where you would live right
now would be the city where your
hometown is if you grew up in Chicago
the most likely place that you're going
to be now as tell Chicago you could be
moving as well but the most likely place
would remain in your hometown but I saw
a fair number of cases where the most
likely current city was different from
the hometown and and that was with a
fairly high probability and I was fairly
surprised
wondering if I had had a prime in my
computations if there was some issues
with the data upstream of what I was
doing so I decided to put all these
cities on a map all the pairs of
hometowns and current cities for which
the most likely current city was
different from the hometown and what we
saw on this map was real fascinating
because that was Ray not what we're
expecting it was not a bug in the code
we were really seeing patterns arise
here we only plotted the pairs of
hometown and current city so there's no
movement between the pairs but what we
see is that a lot of these cities for
which the most likely current city is
different from the hometown arise in
West Africa or in India or in like
Turkey which we were not necessarily
expecting at the beginning and there was
really strength of like a lot of small
cities all moving to
same currency and so we decided to dig
up more into it one thing that happens
is that sometimes the distribution of
the current city is very flat given that
you grew up in let's say Paris maybe
you're still living in Paris but maybe
you live in like one of the thousand
cities in the suburbs and so the
distribution is really flat and so we
had to decide what was considered as a
coordinate in migration we decided that
yeah the probability to move to that
city is high enough that we're
considering that and the other thing
that we had to think about is that if
you look at the map at the world scale
or if you zoom to a very specific areas
you don't want to see the same things so
we also wanted to have some
interactivity in the visualization and
so we decided to use d3 which is a
JavaScript based visualization framework
which enables you to have a lot of
interactivity with with your data and
enabled us to do a lot of data
exploration and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
