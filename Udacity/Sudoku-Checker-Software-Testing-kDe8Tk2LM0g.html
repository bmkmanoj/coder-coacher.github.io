I hope there's a lot of great discussion
going on in the forums over your
solutions and we can go ahead and take a
look at mine real quick which feel free
to break this apart there are issues
with it and I invite you to find them
this is a very non clever solution first
it checks the type of the grid to make
sure that it is a list and that the
length of the list of lists is nine then
for each row we check the type of that
and then we check the length for that as
well and again for all of these so this
is basically just type checking in
length checking over and over and over
again for each different part that we
need to make sure about first off now
check each piece of the Sudoku puzzle
separately we don't try to check them
all at once in any kind of clever way if
you did that then congratulations first
we check the rows from 0 to 9 and we
instantiate a dictionary and we check
all the values if the value isn't 0 but
and the value is already in D in the
dictionary then we return false
immediately because we've already found
this in the row so it's it shouldn't be
there we should only have this in there
once and then we put the value in D if
we don't return and move on and we do
the same thing for the columns okay for
checking the sub grids we basically just
do additional for loops we do the same
dictionary checking as we did for the
rows and the columns but now we use IJ I
I and JJ as a shifter to check the row
and column spot for each of these three
times I plus I shifts over to the
appropriate sub grid and similarly for
the columns Jane with J and JJ and after
that the code is essentially identical
we just check the dictionary to see if
we already have the relevant value in
that sub grid and if we pass through all
this without returning false then we
return true ok and when we were on this
solution we see that we get the same
output that we were supposed to get for
the five
test cases that were given so go ahead
and have a look at that like I said
there are issues with this code and I
invite you to check it out on the forums
and discuss how you would break this
particularly how you would break this
with a random fuzzer and what kind of
problems acidotic a checker might be
vulnerable to with a good fuzzing test
so okay great see you in the forums</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
