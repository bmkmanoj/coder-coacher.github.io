my name is Andy and three years ago I
couldn't code it all now I can and I
want to tell you how that happened I
graduated from college in 2009 with a
degree in physics and I had no coding
skill at all and at the time I was
actually pretty intimidated by
programming even though I didn't start
learning to code until 2012 these three
years from 2009's 2012 are relevant to
how I learned to code because it was
during this time that I was doing a lot
of teaching and a lot of learning about
how people learn and I learned something
that would wind up being incredibly
important to me when I would eventually
learn to code I learned that anyone can
learn anything well just about anyone
can learn just about anything but for
the most part this is true because even
though everyone has different
backgrounds and experiences when you get
down to the level of brains they're all
very similar and our brain is also this
incredibly flexible thing by giving it
the right inputs you can actually change
your brain and make it do whatever you
want but that's enough about the brain
after three years of teaching and
learning sometime in early februari of
2012 I heard about this new education
company called Udacity that was actually
what the logo looked like at the time I
didn't know much about it but online
education sounded really interesting so
I emailed someone who worked there three
days later I was on a plane to San
Francisco it was very exciting but
things he'd asked you were pretty
chaotic back then and nobody had even
told me what my job would be though I
assumed it had something to do with
education and maybe technology either
way februari 15th was my first day of
work and I would figure it out then that
morning I got dropped off at our office
which at the time was just Sebastian
who's our CEO it was his house so I
walked up to the door I still didn't
know what my role would be but that was
going to change in about 30 seconds I
ring the bell and sebastian answered the
conversation went something like this he
told me that I would be the assistant
instructor for the course he was making
this was news to me but I was trying to
play it cool so I asked him to remind me
of the title and then he told me the
course was called CS 373
how to program a robotic car and I was
terrified I didn't know anything about
programming or robotics and I might have
quit right then if I hadn't remembered
that lesson and because I really believe
that anyone can learn anything I started
learning and I haven't stopped and now
here I am today very very excited to be
assembling the resource I wish I had had
three years ago now you may be thinking
why should I entrust my programming
education to someone who only has three
years of experience and the answer is
you shouldn't and you aren't let me
explain how the standard degree is going
to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
