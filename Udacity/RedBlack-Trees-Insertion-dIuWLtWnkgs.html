happens there are several different
states of the tree and the node you're
inserting that required different
courses of action remember that your
resulting tree needs to follow both the
red black tree and BST rules there's a
lot of information here your first goal
should be to watch and get a sense of
how red black trees work you can rewatch
the video later to actually memorize the
details one overall rule of insertion is
that you should try to insert a node as
a red node which from here on out I'll
represent as both red and square to help
with differentiation and then change its
color as needed the first situation is
when you're inserting the first node
into the tree since it's the root you
can change the color to black if you're
adhering to the root must be black rule
otherwise you'll have nothing to do if
the new parent node is black you don't
need to do any work since you're adding
a red node you haven't upset the balance
of black nodes in any path or violated
any of the other rules now if the parent
is red there are several cases with more
complicated solutions if the parent and
its sibling are both red then they
should be changed to black and their
parent the grandparent let's say of the
node you're inserting becomes red we
switch the node colors in this way to
maintain the number of black nodes in a
given path look through all the paths in
this tree the number of black nodes in
each path is still 2 the biggest problem
here is that we could have violated
another property by changing the
grandparent we can just treat the
grandparent as a newly inserted node and
change it or its ancestors according to
the same cases and rules here we just
treat it like case 1 and change it back
to black since we still want the root to
be black</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
