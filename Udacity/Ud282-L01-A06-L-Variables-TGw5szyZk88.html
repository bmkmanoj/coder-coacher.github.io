saison used they're called variables
each variable in Java has a name and a
value the name doesn't change but the
value can keep changing just like the
balls that Suzanne used in the box
those values don't always have to be
numbers they can be letters or even text
however once you create a variable of a
certain type you can only use it to
store values of that particular type for
example if we wanted to create a
variable that keeps track of the number
of passengers on the bus the type of
values here are natural numbers like 0 3
7 and so on because we can't really have
a fraction of a person on the bus right
I'd hope so natural numbers in Java are
called integers so if we wanted to
create a variable of type integer in
Java we will write down int which is
short for integer and then the variable
name which is something that we can come
up with say passengers and then as usual
we end this statement here with a
semicolon just like we did with the
print line earlier so this statement
here tells the computer to create this
empty box that can store natural numbers
inside and its name is passengers what
we just did here is called declaring a
variable this variable now can be used
to store any integer number which can
easily change as more people go on or
off the bus so let's start using it the
first thing we need to do is set it to 0
we do that by typing in the variable
name followed by this equal sign and
then the value we want to set it to in
this case 0 and then never forget that
semicolon at the end this is basically
as if we've inserted the number 0 in our
box what we just did here is called
initializing our variable or giving it
an initial value basically so there you
go now our passengers variable has the
values 0 in it which means our bus has
zero passengers let's start updating it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
