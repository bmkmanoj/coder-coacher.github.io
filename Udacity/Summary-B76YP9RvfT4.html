the bugs have you found alright so I'll
read I'll really basically the type to
severity the location in the description
so this was wrong minor line 1 don't
import a street wrong minor line to
useless in point of are useless in Porto
java.lang stylistic minor line 12
programmed the interfaces not
implementations missing minor lines 13
and 14 no initialization of variables
I'm stylistic minor 13 and 14 integer
versus character file minor lines for
seven and eight we discussed all about
our standard coding style and comments
should be / /a straighten up should we
know how sorry I kind of agree with
Probert us here that we should go with
maybe a minor plus plus or some kind of
other severity styling is emits
important as we kind of talked about
maybe that should be somewhere between
major and minor okay okay really need to
crack down on make sure that one just
setting it washed away yeah and also
before you go to the next one crazy Bob
pleased with the meaning of the various
positions again to the first one is what
the first one is in line number the
second Sosa's yeah so our line numbers
are four seven and eight that's where
the comments I wasn't being clear so the
foreign don't deform so oh oh this is
this is just a number okay the
consecutive numbering about the defect
that we found then the type so there's
missing wrong extra usability
performance style clarity or question
and then there's the severity either
major minor and then we can add plus
plus or minus minus if we feel like and
then the locate the actual line number
of the code so then we have a style
minor line 16 follow should be in
capital letters and character was
misspelled and by was misspelled and
then stylistic minor line 19
inconsistent space and white space
around and then we talked again about
needing some kind of coding standard for
white space then
wrong major plus online 20 the equal
equal should be not equal on our loop
condition then wrong again major lines
19 and 28 we're printing every character
on a new line as an integer then
stylistic major line 20 we had a
question about whether this loop ever
even terminates and we should be
checking for some kind of into file
stylistic minor line 31 the assert
comment is confusing stylistic minor
lines 32 to 35 we should get concatenate
all that system out into one line then
wrong implementation major line 34 we're
printing the wrong bearable style again
minor everywhere is our brace placement
standard we need to come up with some
some kind of standards with S Plus maybe
it was in another plus plus and then
style minor everywhere there's no
Javadoc author tags or any other
information on the code I'm stylistic
major line 36 we should catch specific
exceptions rather than generic exception
stylistic major line 37 we should log
exceptions instead of just exiting
immediately stylistic again major line
39 we need an exit status on our success
stylistic minor lines 19 and 28 we
should not be printing debug information
to the console and then I added another
important one I think is important major
everywhere our implementation should
have been an ADA oh that's a line rd
report very good I think the court
passes right Thank You team I can
certainly breathe easier now that we
have squashed these bugs
ladies and gentlemen I'm afraid I'm
going to have to neural eyes to protect
the identities of our team members
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
