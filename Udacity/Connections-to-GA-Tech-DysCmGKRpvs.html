machine learning engineer nanodegree
program is that for the very first time
we're able to leverage some of the
materials that we've produced as part of
our partnership with Georgia Tech on
their online masters in computer science
program you're going to be hearing from
the same videos the same professors to
teach graduate level machine learning at
Georgia Tech right now you'll hear from
Charles Isabel and Michael Lippmann on
kind of the major schools of thought
machine learning like reinforcement
learning and supervised learning you'll
hear from ashok oil and I about the more
cognitively oriented side of AI a
different perspective on what a I can do
you'll also cover some classes that
apply machine learning specifically to
certain domains like trading in health
care now because these classes were
produced with a Georgia Tech online
master's degree they have their own
learning goals and we're using them in
ways they're a little bit different than
the way they were originally produced so
you might feel a little bit like it's a
little bit chaotic sometimes we'll try
and step in from time to time and set
the expectations and remind you of what
our learning goals are we just wanted to
let you know that if you feel like it's
a little bit disjointed at time that's
intentional that kind of comes with the
territory of using the materials been
produced for this master's program like
