use of non-us alphabet characters when
he first wrote programs for texts in
Spanish and run them using Python he got
an error syntax error non ascii
character who did not get that error
when running the same code in idle it
worked as it should he solved this by
changing the encoding so as we're
building a search engine that will scan
pages in different languages and perhaps
use different language interfaces how
should we change our code so that it
does not run into problems with an
encoding what should our default pirate
does that be thanks for the question
Raymond and this is a really good point
to bring up that as you take inputs that
include more languages than just English
well the character sets are different
and if you look at a web page there's a
header in the web page that identifies
what character set it's using this is
part of the HTTP protocol to have a
header that describes the content type
which includes the character set and the
character set can be selected from a few
different ones the most comment1 the
most common one is called utf-8 and
that's using a way of encoding
characters that makes the simple
characters that can be encoded in just 7
bits and this is the character set that
is known as ASCII these are characters
that are common in English doesn't cover
all the characters that are used in all
other languages but those 7-bit
characters can encode be encoded using a
small amount of space and the standard
we've been using a Python with standard
strings that they're all asking that
each character is one bite there's only
255 possible characters that can be
encoded in one bite though so if you're
wanting to deal with more languages you
need to use more different characters
the way to do that is called Unicode
unicode is a character set that can
support large numbers of characters it's
actually a way of encoding characters
that doesn't have a limit on how many
characters you can support and a way of
encoding those that makes it efficient
when the characters are small but allows
you to still encode a large number of
characters is called utf-8 which is what
most
web browsers use to deal with this in
Python well you'd have to deal with
instead of standard strings Unicode
strings and there is a built-in type for
Unicode characters you can convert a
string to Unicode by using Unicode and
then their ways of encoding Unicode and
other character sets so if you wanted to
build a web search engine that can deal
with text that's not using the standard
English character set you definitely
need to worry about handling Unicode and
all these different character encodings</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
