created a little app to demonstrate
extracting a palette from an image the
first thing we need to do in our apps
build that Gradle file is add the
support library for a palette as a
dependency so after we receive an image
resource identifier for an image we can
load it into our view and convert it
into a bitmap that the palette will use
to generate the color swatches
alternatively if we've taken a photo
will receive a bitmap from the camera
without the need for that conversion
step these color swatches fall into two
different areas either a vibrant or a
muted color the type and number of
swatches is dependent on the composition
of your image and how much of it is in a
certain color and how that color
contrast to other colors in the image if
you want to read more about that you can
check the instructor notes for a link to
the Java Doc's for the palette library
so right here in this code I take the
palette and I'm looking through all of
the different swatches to see if they
exist before returning a hashmap
so let's check it out on a device if we
hit this floating action button and pick
an image let's pick something from our
android nanodegree kick off we can see
that it's created a pallet for us now
one of the interesting colors here is
this vibrant color from these Android
stickers when I click the item it shows
us how many pixels in the image were
from that color next roman's going to
talk to you about typography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
