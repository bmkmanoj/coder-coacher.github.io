object diagram to clarify how text
fields interact with delegates using the
UI text field delegate protocol we'll
start with the view controller which of
course has outlets to the four views and
here are our views and up here are our
colorizer and emoji delegates you can
see that each of the corresponding
uitextfield view objects has an outlet
pointing to a delegate these objects can
be delegates because they implement the
UI text field delegate protocol this
third text field has the view controller
as its delegate so the view controller
also needs to implement the UI text
field delegate protocol so why would we
want to use a view controller as a
delegate because the view controllers
role in the architecture is to manage
all of the views the behavior of the
third text field is connected to a label
the label is updated with the character
count whenever the text in the text
field changes now I want to walk through
the method invocation so we can clarify
how the delegate pattern is used to keep
the character count label up-to-date so
if we were to trace the users actions
the user is going to tap on the third
text field tap a key on the keyboard and
then the number is immediately updated
now let's step through that sequence of
events again in our diagram the user
taps the keyboard the text field
realizes that the text will change the
text field invokes the method should
change characters in range all of these
methods happen behind the scenes the
text field invokes the method should
change characters in range the view
controller receives that invocation so
it updates the label and it returns true
if we zoom in on the view controller
swift file we can see the code for some
of these steps we won't be able to find
these first three steps in our code
those are happening behind the scenes
the first step we can see is number four
when the invocation comes in from the
text field here is step 5 where the
variable new text is being set to the
characters we just typed here's step 6
where the text of the label is being set
and here's step 7 return
true notice again that you don't get to
see where the uitextfield delegate
method in vacations begin we just
implement the protocol and handle the
indications as they come in now let's
take a quick look at the other two
delegates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
