with no letters then the length of the
book will decrease by five times the
number of occurrences of Alice because
Alice has five letters so if we
calculate the length of the book with
Alice and the length of the book without
Alice and then take the difference we
can divide the difference by five and
get the number of occurrences so here
again is our book class with our new
method occurrences of Alice first we'll
calculate the original length and then
the length after we remove all the
currencies of Alice by replacing Alice
with an empty string then we return the
difference between the 2 all divided by
5 let's add a line to our book tester to
see how many times alice actually occurs
and if we run the main method again it
now tells us that alice occurs 395 times
it's not totally clear or obvious that
this would be correct but you could
check in a few ways for example you
could open up the text and use some
other program to search for the number
of occurrences of Alice or you can find
some word that only appears once or
maybe a string of words so that you
could be pretty sure that it would only
occur once and try using that to debug
your code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
