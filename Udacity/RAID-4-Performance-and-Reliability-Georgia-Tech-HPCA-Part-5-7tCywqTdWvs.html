performance and reliability of a raid 4
array 4 reads we are getting on average
the throughput of n minus one disks we
can read data from all of the data disks
but the parity disk has no useful data
on it so for reads we don't use it this
is significantly improving read
performance because usually we have more
than just two disks in an array so for
example with 4 disks we are really
getting for each the throughput of three
disks all of the data discs for writes
however the data accesses are
distributed among the data discs however
every write requires the parity disk to
read and then write we need to read the
old parity updated and then write it
back so we are getting only one half of
the throughput of a single disk because
the parity disk again needs two accesses
for every write this is a significant
disadvantage and we will see that this
is really the primary reason why we need
raid 5 now let's look at the reliability
what is the MTTF of a raid 4 disk again
we have two options just like raid 1 the
first period we get is while all of the
disks are working the timing half during
that period is on average MTTF of the
single disk divided by n because that's
how long we have for the first of n
disks to fail just like raid 1 after
this first failure we did not lose the
data yet and now we have two options if
we do no repair of the failed disk then
now we are operating with n minus 1
good disks if we do no repair of the
failed disk what we get now is at the
point of the first failure we are left
with the N minus 1 disk array and any
disk failure in that array is going to
result in data loss so if we don't do
repair then to this we add the expected
time until the first failure among the n
minus one disks that we still have this
Plus this
if n is let's say for is not going to be
better than the MTTF of a single disc so
you don't want to even consider using
raid 4 unless you're going to do repairs
so pretty much you don't do this because
it's a bad idea you're not getting any
increased reliability what you want to
do is repair the failed disk in which
case the chances of a disk failing
during the repair period is the MTTF of
what's left of our array with raid 1 we
had one disk left here we have n minus 1
disk left so the MTTF for the remaining
disks is lower than for one disk because
we are talking about the first failure
among the n disks so for example if we
have three disks the first failure among
three is going to happen sooner than the
first failure among just the one disk
and then we divide that with the mean
time to repair so this is the factor
with which we now multiply our this is
for how long we get a rate fault to work
until we lose a disk
so overall the MTTF of our raid 4 array
is going to be the MTTF of one disk
times again the MTTF of one disk divided
by n times n minus 1 times the MTTR for
the disk so note that again you know
this is very small compared to this so
this particular ratio is extremely large
the number of disks is let's say 4 you
don't want to have too many disks in a
raid 4 array if that is so then what we
get is the MTTF of a single disk that is
fairly large multiplied by something
that is usually in the thousands of more
or more and divided by something that is
usually something like you know if it's
4 disks it's going to be 12 so this MTTF
of r84 if we repair the failed disk
every time it fails we get an empty TF
that is still very very large</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
