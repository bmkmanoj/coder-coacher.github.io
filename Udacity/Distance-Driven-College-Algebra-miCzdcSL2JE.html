hopped in her car and started to drive
part way through the trip her cell phone
rang and she decided to answer the call
it was her brother Niko's he wanted to
know how close she was to getting to his
house so she started trying to figure
out the distance she'd driven so far
Athena's been going at pretty much the
same speed the entire time so what two
quantities can she relate together in an
equation that also involves that
constant speed pick two of the four
choices that are down here should the
equation include the distance she's
driven the time for trip has taken her
car's fuel efficiency or how much her
car weighs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
