different examples here basically doing
a comparison to conventional aperture
Corrections or conventional aperture
like this to use for doing Corrections
you see a little bit of ringing that's
shown here it's a lot of defocusing you
can see a little bit of ringing here
also this is the output with this
aperture much crisper image here is an
example very similar to what we looked
at when we did light field work of being
able to defocus or focus an image in a
single image itself you can see
basically interactively we can focus one
of one of the subjects and move around
and be able to focus on the other one
again this is coded aperture used to do
these types of captioning a whole
information on one image to be able to
allow you to do this refocusing from a
single image in this example hopefully
you can see this on your compressed
videos now actually I'm going to borrow
a specific example on how these authors
generated this coded aperture
that's it they basically did was open up
a lens I don't recommend doing that your
favorite high-end expensive rents by
yourselves but open it up and put that
small aperture in there and then seal
the camera back and of course when they
put the camera the lens back on a camera
you basically have a coded aperture
again do this at your own peril I don't
recommend taking off and breaking up
your very very favorite lens to do this
kind of stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
