where there was a goal of trying to
unify these various techniques together
which led to the unified modeling
language UML there's a industry group
called the object management group
called oMG that is the home for this
standardization effort it's where you
can find the specification documents
which I refer to you refer you to during
the course of the term UML has also been
championed by IBM they acquired a
company called rational which had
developed a development environment
called rational rows which supported
directly UML there's lots of such case
tools now aside from rational rows one
that we've used is Enterprise Architect
now these are commercial tools there's
also all kinds of drawing tools out
there which you can get for free
UML itself had three main architects one
was Rumbaugh one was Grady Booch and the
other was I've already jockelson okay
they sometimes called the three amigos
they produced in addition to the unified
modeling language itself three books a
reference manual to users guide and so
on that had as main authors each one of
the three and together conveyed the
overall approach to UML it's important
to note at this stage that the UML
diagrams can be used both for design but
also for analysis and I'll try to
distinguish as we go forward whether
we're talking about an analysis diagram
or a design diagram the main distinction
is analysis is concerned with the
problem being solved and design is
concerned with the solution to that
problem I've taken some of these
diagrams are about to see from the UML
reference manual and from the UML user's
guide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
