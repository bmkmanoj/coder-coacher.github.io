viruses first let's take a look at the
structure of virus a virus infects a
program by modifying the program code
that is the virus code has to be
physically inserted into the program
file logically when the infected program
runs the virus goes run first then the
original program will run so that user
would not suspect that the program has
been infected and then at the end there
could be some iris code that does clean
up to avoid detection if you look at the
infected program the first line can
shows that the virus program will always
run first it is critically important to
put this control in the first line of
the infected program because this is the
only way to guarantee that the virus
code will always be run whenever the
program executes it is also important to
put a marker in the infected program
such as putting a special flag in a
second line of the infected program to
indicate whether the program has been
infected by the virus or not otherwise a
program can be repeatedly infected when
the virus Co is run he typically first
find other programs to infect of course
it will check whether a program has been
infected already by looking at the
special flag in addition to infecting
other programs the virus code can also
perform other malicious activities on
the system such as Yuling valuable
documents after performing the malicious
actions the virus will then transfer the
control to the original program so that
the normal work can be performed in such
a way the user would not notice the
virus code can also perform other
actions in order to avoid detection for
example because the virus code is
physically inserted into the original
program file the file size of the
original program obviously increases and
this can be a telltale sign that a
program has been infected therefore in
order to avoid detection the virus code
can compress the infected program so
that the file size is the same as the
size of the program before it is
infected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
