somebody say wow this was a lot harder
than I thought it'd be all the time I
think I heard you say this morning I
think I see it a few times a week
I mean coding no matter how long you've
been doing it is always difficult
problems always come up that's true in
reality the sign of a good developer
isn't someone who's very smart it's
someone who's good at solving problems
and can persevere you're going to run
into problems you're going to get
frustrated there will be times you are
confused and you're going program
yourself into a corner that seems
inescapable whenever you run into these
situations it's important that you keep
going and I don't mean keep going in the
sense that you're just banging your head
against the wall and get more and more
frustrated I mean going in a sense that
day after day little by little you just
make some progress that's how you can
get through any problem to help out here
are a few problem-solving strategies
first off there's sleeping on it
seriously it's helpful take a break come
back fresh and you'll be surprised to
find how much easier some problems get
you also have Google and Stack Overflow
to help out most of the time your errors
are going to have messages copy and
paste those messages into Google and
you'll be surprised to find out how
quickly you can get answers to your
questions Stack Overflow is awesome
because people vote on answers so you
can get a sense of what strategy the
community thinks will solve a problem
seriously this is a great strategy and
will solve lots and lots and lots of
problems for you but hey speaking of
community try asking the community you
aren't alone remember you're going to be
learning alongside a lot of other people
reach out and ask for help if you're
lucky enough to know some web developers
in real life talk to them too they might
be able to point you in the right
direction and sometimes you might need
to rethink what you're doing when I'm
working on something complicated I like
to draw a picture this picture is an
actual drawing I made the other night
for an actual project it's not very
pretty it's just pencil on graph paper
but it really doesn't have to be shapes
were
and arrows are often good enough this
drawing turned out to be super helpful
for me and wound up saving me a lot of
work later so it's often helpful to get
your ideas on paper and stop juggling
them in your head you'll be able to make
better decisions if you can see the
whole picture and lastly I want you to
look at your mistakes and missteps as
learning opportunities look at it like
this you're never really wrong you just
aren't right yet that's really solid
advice I think I've done all of those
things throughout my career yeah I think
we all have as you will know the best
thing is at the end of the day feeling
is just absolutely incredible when
something starts to work we want you to
keep these techniques in mind as you
work on your nano degree and beyond
you'll be evolving as you learn and get
better at pushing through the problems
you face to help you remember this I
want you to create a quick little
reflection on how you'll push through
the challenges ahead of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
