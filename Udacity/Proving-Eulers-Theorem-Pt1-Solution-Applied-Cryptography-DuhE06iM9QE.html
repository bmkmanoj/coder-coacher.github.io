know this is the case because this set
has n minus 1 elements we also know that
they're no duplicates in this setting
because we know that n is prime and a is
not divisible by n so that means this
will generate the numbers 1 through n
minus 1 in some order some permutation
of those but since it's a set it's the
same as the set 1 through n minus 1 this
turns out to be a useful property for
proving Fermat's little theorem because
we can set these two things as equal and
multiply all the elements in those sets
so since we know they're the same set we
know that their products are also equal
and this product is n minus 1 factorial
so since the sets contain the same
elements we know their products also
must be equal so this is the product of
the first set this is the product of the
second sentence n minus 1 factorial
because it's multiplying all those
numbers up to n minus 1 and mod n those
must be equal we took the mod n out of
each of these terms but that's fine then
we can simplify this
taking out the A's and so if we take out
all the A's what we have is 1 times 2
times 3 times n minus 1 times a still
equal to n minus 1 factorial mod n so
now we can separate this taking out all
the numbers and all the A's so we'll
have n minus 1 terms so we have 8 of N
minus 1 here times all the numbers is
still equal to n minus 1 factorial this
is the same as n minus 1 factorial so
now we can remove these terms and we're
left with exactly what we wanted that a
to the N minus 1 is congruent to 1 mod n
so this is pretty close to what we want
but what we needed for euler's theorem
and what we'll need for the RSA
correctness proof is this property with
the totient of n and that's different
from what we have here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
