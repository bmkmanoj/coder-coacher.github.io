class you can think of an association
class as an association that has some
class properties for example attributes
or you can think of it as a class that
has some Association properties here's
an example if we have a company class
and a person class and we have some kind
of association between them that a
person has a job with the company we
might want to indicate what that
person's salary is from that company so
this is not really a property of the
person because the person might have
more than one job it's not really a
property of the company because the
company certainly has more than one
person it's really a property of the
Association itself Association classes
are indicated by having a dashed line
that abuts into the Association line at
the end of the dashed line is another
rectangle in this case it's the
association class called job and in the
class rectangle for job there is an
attribute of salary notice something
else a little peculiar here that job has
an association with itself this is
called a recursive Association for
recursive associations in particular
you'd better use role names in this case
we're talking about the manages
Association so one job might manage
another job the department head might
manage the staff and therefore we want
to have roles for the boss or supervisor
and the worker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
