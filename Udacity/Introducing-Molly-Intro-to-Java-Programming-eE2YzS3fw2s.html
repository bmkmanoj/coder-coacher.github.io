bellevue washington and I'm a senior
here at Stanford and I first got into
computer science when I was doing a
FIRST robotics program at my high school
I didn't take any coding classes until I
got to Stanford and I took CS 106a my
freshman year Fall Quarter and I loved
it but before that I thought I was
interested in math science maybe
engineering and so I took an engineering
course in the summer at Cornell
University trying to figure out if
that's something I was interested in and
there I got to tour their HCI lab which
is human computer interaction and that
studies how people interact with
technology and I was really interested
in how to design technology for people
and make it something that was going to
be both effective and really useful for
them and that's what really got me
excited about exploring CS because
computer science is all about designing
and solving problems that are going to
be useful for the people that are using
these programs and so from there I took
a lot of really amazing CS classes here
and from there I was sold and I took the
rest of the CS classes and had a really
great time with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
