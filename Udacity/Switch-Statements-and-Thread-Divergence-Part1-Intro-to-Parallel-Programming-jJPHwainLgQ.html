kernel for example we could have a
switch statement with 32 more cases if
each thread in a warp switches to a
different case and each case took the
same amount of time to execute this
segment of the kernel would run 32 times
slower than if all the threads in a warp
and switch to the same case
okay so let's explore this with a quiz
so I'm gonna give you a bunch of switch
statements and we're gonna pretend that
they're in a kernel and that all of the
cases of those switch statements take an
equal amount of time okay so I'll do the
first example to explain the format that
I'm looking for here we've got a switch
statement this is in kernel code it's
switching on the thread index dot X mod
32 and that means that you're going to
get a number from 0 to 31 and I've I've
just sort of used this shortcut notation
to indicate that I've got cases 0
through 31 I want you to assume that all
these cases take the same amount of time
and then there's some more code and
later on I'm actually going to launch
this kernel and I'm gonna launch it in a
configuration like this it's gonna have
a single thread block with 1024 threads
and so the question that I'm asking you
is what is the slowdown is it 1x meaning
no slowdown at all is it 32x meaning a
factor of 30 you know assuming all these
cases take the same amount of time it's
going to run 32 times slower through
this section of the code due to branch
divergence what's going on and so I'll
give you a series of these using this
sort of shorthand notation and I want
you to think about what is the the
slowdown that you're gonna get due to
the thread divergence the different
threads in a warp so the answer to this
first one this is sort of the example
we've been discussing ok every thread is
going to go a different path every
thread in the warp will have a different
value for this thread index those values
will be 0 through 31 so every single
thread will take a different path and
that means that the warp is going to
have to activate each thread in turn run
through that particular case deactivate
that thread activate another thread run
through that case and so forth so this
will lead to the maximum slowdown of 32
times here's our next example and what
I'm going to try to do for each of these
examples is highlight and black the the
parts of the code that are different
from the the first example that I gave
in this case we're launching similarly
launching a kernel with 1024 threads and
now we've got cases 0 through 63 and
we're taking the thread index and we're
modding it by 64 instead of by 32 your
job is to figure out the slowdown what
about a two-dimensional kernel here what
I'm using I'm using some shorthand to
indicate that I'm launching a thread
block which has 64 threads in the
x-direction and 16 threads in the
y-direction again a single thread block
and I'm going to switch on the Y index
of the thread and next another example
where I'm going to switch on the Y index
of the thread as before except this time
I'm launching a thread block with 16 by
16 threads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
