true s and x3 is exactly the same thing
as s index 1 plus 1 plus 1 because 1
plus 1 plus 1 evaluates to 3 these two
have the same value if s is a string
with at least 4 characters in it
this will get the fourth character from
s if s has fewer than 4 characters both
of these will produce an error the
second choice both of these actually
also have the same value s index 0 will
get us the first character of s as long
as s has at least one character
otherwise it will produce an error S
Plus s will produce the string
concatenated itself but its first
character is still the same as the first
character of s so these two are
equivalent the third option is not
equivalent so here we're taking the
first character of s concatenating that
with the second character of s here
we're taking from s the 0 plus 1 scare
achter which is evaluates to 1 so that's
the second character of s this is just
going to be 1 character this is two
characters they're never equivalent the
fourth option is sometimes equivalent if
s is a string with at least two
characters then s index 1 is the second
character from s s plus it e index 1 is
the second character for s the problem
is if s has less than two characters so
suppose our value of s was just a one
letter string s index 1 will be an error
there's no second character from s s
plus it e index 1 would be the second
character of the string that results
from that concatenation which would
actually be the I so these are not
always equivalent they're equivalent in
the case where s has at least two
characters the final option we have s
negative 1 so that means the last
character of s and we have s plus S
which produces the string which
concatenates s with itself in X negative
1 that's going to be a last character of
concatenating s with itself
which is the same as the last character
of s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
