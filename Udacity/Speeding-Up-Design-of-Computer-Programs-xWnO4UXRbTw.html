here so we had re dot split and then
this regular expression and then out of
the formula so what does this say this
says I want to split up the original
formula and the way I'm splitting it up
is I'm taking sequences of the
characters a to Z in a row the plus
means one or more and the parenthesis
means keep that result so when I have u
equals me squared this part and this
part will match and they'll be returned
as individual elements in this split and
so will the other parts re dot split
will return the list consisting of the
parts that it found in the split plus
everything in between will be this type
of list and then I'm going to map
compile word didn't quite fit on one
line to re dot split and that will give
me these tokens will remain unchanged
and these will be converted into the
form that multiplies out the digits and
then I'm going to assign that to the
variable tokens now I've got my tokens
the body of the function would just form
by concatenating all the tokens together
if I wanted to I could put spaces
between them it doesn't matter and then
the function is lambda created with the
parameters and the body and then I just
return the evaluation of the function so
that compiles a function does it only
once rather than once per permutation
and I return the letters that I found
and as a convenience because when you're
debugging this function you may want to
say well what did what this function
look like what did I come up with I'm
have an optional parameter here that
says if you pass in verbose equals true
then it just prints out what it found it
just makes it a little bit easier to
debug this function and now when I run
profiling again look what I get the time
has speeded up quite a bit on the simple
list of 14 examples that we saw before
this version of the code is 25 times
faster on more complex a list it's only
13 times fast
but it's at least an order of magnitude
faster and we did that because we
eliminated calls to eval so we found the
bottleneck
we found that eval was a function that
was taking up the most amount of time in
the previous profiling we figured out a
way to call eval less often by pre
compiling and now we've done away with
with that difficulty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
