mango is one of the MongoDB drivers or
client libraries and because python is
the programming language for this course
we'll be using the Python driver you'll
find that you have access to PI Mongo in
the IDE now one thing to keep in mind
about PI Mongo or any other MongoDB
driver is that their basic job is to
maintain a connection to the database
and to allow you to work in your
language of choice and interact with
your data in a very natural way now if
you'd like to know more about drivers
for other languages I'd encourage you to
visit API dot MongoDB org where you can
read about all supported drivers now
before we dive in a look at an example I
want to talk a little bit about the
application architecture just so you
have that picture in your mind as we're
working through the rest of the material
in this lesson okay so if you download
MongoDB and run it on your local
computer this picture basically
represents the architecture you'll start
MongoDB and the daemon that's running is
Mongo D and then you'll create a Python
application that includes the PI Mongo
module and using the PI Mongo module you
can send requests and receive responses
from MongoDB pi Mongo communicates with
the database using what we call the wire
protocol and the data that's exchanged
is in a format called beasts on beasts
on is a binary encoding for JSON if you
google for beasts on you'll easily find
a spec okay so let's look at an app okay
here I'm going to use that example that
we saw before for the Tesla s but let's
talk about the PI Mongo components of
this particular application here we're
importing the Mongo client class from
the PI Mongo module and then we're going
to create a client object and note that
here we specify the connection string we
won't go into too much detail on this
but essentially this will allow us to
connect to any mangodi instance that we
have access to okay here's the encoding
of the Tesla as a Python dictionary and
then here what we're doing is specifying
that we want to use the examples
database and what we're going to do here
is insert this document here finally
we're going to do a find query and then
for every document that we get back
we're simply going to print that
document out okay now before we run this
I want to point out two things one is
that here we use
the insert command in order to store
this document in the autos collection
for the examples database here we're
using the find command and find when run
this way will simply give us back a
cursor for all of the documents in in
this case the autos collection whatever
collection we specify here ok and we'll
go into more detail on these later on in
this lesson so let's run this ok and we
can see that what we got back and
printed out was the one and only
document that we had inserted into this
collection brand-new collection when we
inserted the document that became the
first document in the collection and one
thing I want to point out is that in
addition to all of the fields we
specified in our code there's a new
field underscore ID that has this object
ID value ok that's a value that was
added by the database and we'll talk a
little bit later about exactly what this
value represents the short story is that
MongoDB ensures that any document we
insert can be uniquely identified by its
underscore ID field and if we don't
specify a value for underscore ID
MongoDB will create one for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
