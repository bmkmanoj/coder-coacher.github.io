not to have one consistent definition
it's very algorithm driven so there's
different algorithms for doing
clustering and we can analyze each of
those algorithms somewhat independently
there isn't really one problem and then
there's a bunch of different algorithms
for attacking that one problem each
algorithm kind of is its own problem so
I think the the easiest way to go
through and talk about in supervised
learning and clustering is to start
going through some algorithm so I'm
going to start with single linkage
clustering because I think it's in many
ways the simplest and most natural okay
it has some very nice properties so it's
it's it's not a terrible idea it's been
very useful in statistics for a very
long time so so here's how single
linkage clustering goes let's imagine
we've got these objects that we'll call
them these little these little red dots
were imagine that they're objects and
just because it would be hard to write
down all the D values between them let's
just literally use the two-dimensional
space the distance is on the slide here
as the distances okay
okay so you can so if you were if you
were asked to cluster this well how
would you do it like what do you think
the the groupings ought to be well just
staring at them there are either two or
therefore hmm or maybe there's five so I
would probably put the three on the left
that are together together and I would
put the four on the right that are
together together or I might notice that
the two at the top of the ones on the
right are more together than the other
two and and subdivide them some more but
if I were just far enough away I would
definitely say so that seems like a
reasonable clustering but also the one
that took all four of those and put them
together is a reasonable cluster right
yeah yeah I mean that sort of agrees
with what my eyes are thinking as well
all right so so it'd be good if we could
recover that kind of structure
algorithmically so let's um let's talk
through this this algorithm it's called
single linkage clustering sometimes slc
or slick nice it's it's a hierarchical
agglomerative clustering algorithm or
hack yeah I like that a acronym even
better that's an Andrew Moore joke for
what it's worth no it's a slick hack
nice all right so here's what we're
gonna do we're going to consider each
object a cluster to start we're going to
do this iteratively so we start off with
n objects like we have here one two
three four five six seven and we're
going to define the inter inter
clustered distance as the distance
between the closest two points in the
two clusters so in this in the beginning
all the cluster all the points are in
their own clusters all the objects are
in their own clusters so the inter
cluster distance is exactly the inter
object distance okay okay but little by
little we're going to actually be
aggregating things into larger clusters
and we have to define what it means for
how close is one cluster to another and
we'll say the close the closest of
between two clusters is the closest of
the closest two points between those two
clusters all right so so now what we're
going to do is we're going to iterate
we're going to say merge the two closest
clusters because you know they belong
together and then we're just going to
repeat that n minus K times to leave us
with K clusters so k is now an input to
this algorithm okay all right so so help
me out let's let's step through this
what what would we merge first according
to this algorithm well they're all their
own closer I according to my eyesight
which is of course perfect I would take
the two leftmost ones upper leftmost
ones probably and merge them together
they look closest to me all right let me
let me label them just to make your life
a little bit easier let me know if all
right
so what do you think I would bring a and
B together all right there now a cluster
so we had seven clusters now we have six
okay then we're trying to get oh by the
way we're trying to get down to two okay
and then I would put C and D together
yeah that's what I was thinking too then
I would probably want to put C D and E
together because they're in alphabetical
order
hey all right well let's just to be
concrete about this why what is the next
step that we're supposed to do what
we're supposed to do is say which pair
of clusters is closest and again the the
distance between say I don't know the a
B cluster and the CD cluster is not the
average over all the points or the
furthest points but the closest one so
like I think C and D the distance
between the a B cluster and the CD
cluster is exactly the distance between
B and D in this case that makes sense
yeah all right so so we want to know
what's the currently closest pair of
clusters well from from where I'm
looking it's either e to C and D or G to
a and B and they look very similar me e
to C and D or G to BA
yeah I said probably G to B in a staring
I tried really hard to make it so that
there'd be an easy answer but you're
right I they're really close so let's
let's I think it doesn't matter too much
we'll say that that one's next so now
let's say now we'll do a quick quiz okay
so what merge does single link
clustering do next just give the pair of
points that I would be connecting so
they say separated by a comma</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
