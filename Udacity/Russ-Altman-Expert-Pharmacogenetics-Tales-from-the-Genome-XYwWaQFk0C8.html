faculty at Stanford and a number of
departments including bioengineering and
genetics they pay me and then I have an
appointment in medicine and in computer
science and I live nearby at Stanford
from New York originally that's great
and you are one of the creators the
Creator I guess of pharmgkb it's a team
I wrote the original proposal and have
continued to be the principal
investigator it's now in its 13th year
we started back in two thousand great
and so for somebody who's just seen
pharmgkb for the first time what is it
all about so we are totally excited
about the how genetics can influence
your drug response and back in two
thousand the NIH and others realized
that there needed to be a central
repository to gather all that
information together so the mission of
form gkb simply put is to understand all
human genetic variation that we that
impacts drug response and to catalog it
to make it available to researchers and
eventually practitioners so they can use
it in their work and it's a one-stop
shop for the genetic influences on drug
response it feels like a mountain of
information we have we do we do this in
two ways we have human curators who are
experts in pharmacogenomics and they
read the literature literally every week
as the journals come out they scan I'm
looking for jeans and drugs and their
relationships being discussed and then
put them on a queue for human curation
this has become difficult and so the
second effort in the lab our software
tools to do this so we do a lot of
natural language processing data mining
and stuff like that to try to help put
good articles in front of the curators
so that they can be more efficient we do
still want humans in the loop because
this is sufficiently tricky and the end
goal being it might actually affect
patients so we're not ready to close the
loop and just have computers doing it
also there's always a human in the loop
so far well who's the intended audience
for this is this sort of opened up
mainly to clinicians or science people
or anyone's a great question that has
evolved for the first five seven years
of the database it was specifically just
for pharmacogenetic researchers to let
them know what was known and what was
not known really so they could pick the
problems to work on and not reinvent the
wheel or be unaware
some important discoveries that have
been made with the success of the field
however it has become increasingly
apparent that some of this stuff is
ready to roll out in clinical practice
and so we are now involved in consortium
where we're actually writing clinical
practice guidelines for clinicians to
actually use pharmacogenomics in
practice and that's probably where we'll
stop will probably go all the way from
the raw data all the way up to the
clinical advice that you would give to a
physician who's making a decision about
drug prescribing Wow and that's really
exciting because that's how you actually
impact patients and that's why we do
this we did this because we all believed
that the genome was going to be
important for health and your response
to drugs turns out to be one of the key
early uses of the genome that will be
able to benefit patients with so if you
were an individual just a lay person who
had personal genetic information about
let's say a gene that affects the
metabolism of a certain drug you could
take your variation and go to farm gkb
and what would you find out you so at
pharmgkb you would find a couple of
things you would find the entire
literature on that drug gene pair index
as to how good was this not how good was
the study but how big was the study how
compelling were the statistics when they
did the analysis and you'll find all the
individual papers but where you'll also
find is products that our team has
created to kind of integrate that data
so these clinical guidelines are one
thing that you may find these require a
lot of evidence so there's not as many
of them as there are things for weaker
evidence there's about 12 of them where
we can really put down clinical advice
but our curators also put together
pathways of drug response to show what's
happening in the liver or what's
happening in the effector cells that are
affected by all of these genetic
variations they also write summaries
this gene is important because and they
actually publish these summaries so that
somebody who wants to learn about a
particularly important gene so a patient
unless they have scientific background
would not find too much a physician
would find those clinical guidelines and
the supporting evidence and a researcher
would find
well a candyland of the Roman the raw
published literature and then what we
hope are very useful summaries of it to
help them think about what the next
research questions should be yeah it
sounds like a great amalgamation of the
information that exists but in a
centralized place we call it a knowledge
pyramid we in fact if you look at the
site from gkb org please visit it
pharmgkb org has this knowledge pyramid
where we have the raw data that's
published in the literature and then we
have aggregations of it and then we have
filtering of it and then we have the
clinical advice that we give to doctors
and that's really how it works you have
all this research that eventually
impacts patients you keep track of how
many entries you have like how many drug
genetic variation responses absolutely
so I do annual reports for the NIH okay
and so over the years we have totally
instrumented the site we know how many
hits every page gets we know the most
popular pathways that people look at the
most popular genes name one so people
love coding and people don't they so
don't exactly it's a pain reliever
people are very interested in warfarin
for the pathways those are the ones they
like for the genes they like some of the
genes that are involved there's a gene
called cyp2d6 terrible name cytochrome
p450 2d6 which is very important for
hundreds of drugs and that's one of our
top hits Wow and what are people using
when they when you say at the top hit
these are probably researchers using the
situation so we learned a long time ago
that people like the google type
interface they don't really want to do
super duper searches with lots of bells
and whistles they want to type free text
so we've optimized our free text search
on the site the nice thing about that is
it's really easy to look at the free
text searches and to categorize what's
the average length how many words are
included and what genes drugs and
diseases are being mentioned and we can
then use that kind of to do market
research for the site to improve it
because we see what people are typing in
and we can type those same things in and
say do we like the answers that we're
giving when somebody types that in so
what would you say are what kinds of
tools would you like to see in the farm
gkb site that maybe aren't there now
great question and we're thinking about
this rapidly this has been a website for
13 years but guess what there's these
things called mobile devices we haven't
engineered the site for that but it is
loud and clear from our users that they
are at conferences and somebody mentions
a gene and they're going to go on to
their smartphone or their iPad or their
galaxy whatever and they're going to
type it in and so we're working very
hard at how do you take all this
information and just give the highlights
in a much more restricted real estate
stuff people all over the world are
worrying about this and we are too so
there's that but it's funny the other
thing is we have a very textual based
site and it's good if you want to read
text but it's come to our attention that
people even when they have a lot of
monitor space they want to look at
prettier graphics they want to see
networks versus text so we're also
thinking of refactoring the whole site
to produce a network way of thinking
about pharmacogenomics like here's a
drug and here's all the genes that
connect to it or his or gene and it's
drugs or here's a network that connects
genes and drugs and so we're also
prototyping that kind of stuff so that's
kind of user interface type things that
we're doing on the content side we're
very interested in pushing these natural
language processing because our curators
are starting to see that they work very
hard and the literature is starting to
get them overwhelmed what other
resources would you recommend I mean it
says do you want pharmgkb to be sort of
the one-stop shop or there are other
useful resources that you would
recommend to people sort of in
conjunction with absolutely so a couple
things we have this tab based display
format right now and one of the tabs is
other resources and it's very important
because what we can do is since we know
the drug or the gene that the user is
currently looking at we can have super
specific links to other information
sources about those drugs about those
jeans about the diseases that they treat
and so we have those links and we are
always looking for more links because
this is what the this is the beauty of
the world wide web as you can make these
connections in addition to that
sometimes a data source is so valuable
that we with the permission of the
people who are creating it bring it into
the farm gk bisa
we can more tightly integrate that data
with our data so this kind of two phases
of the relationship they will definitely
link to you phase and then the we love
you so much that if it's okay with you
we'd like to bring you in and make you
part of our interface part of the way we
represent information and these include
basic biological databases like GenBank
which holds DNA sequence there's a very
valuable drug resource called drug Bank
which we link to there are the DB gap
which it holds jiwa studies and and and
a long list of other links that you wish
it on this side I'm curious is um online
Mendelian inheritance in man part of us
Oh ma'am or online inheritance great
resource kills us in some ways because
it's great but it's text-based and it is
not super structured hard to write
computer programs to parse it and so but
we do that because it's incredibly
valuable yeah you mentioned that one of
the most popular hits of things that
people are interested in are the
warfarin pathways now why is that so
warfarin is pretty much the most
advanced case of pharmacogenetics that
has been studied well why do I say that
warfarin has more than one drug that
impacts its response and we actually
know what a lot of those more than one
GM sorry morphin has more than one gene
that's important for understanding its
response and we actually know what a lot
of those genes are and how to combine
the information from more than one gene
that's that's a frontier there are many
gene drugs for which we know that are
several genes but we don't know how to
combine the information yet we do for
warfarin so that's the first thing the
second thing about warfarin is that we
also know some of the environmental
variables that affect warfarin response
how much green leafy vegetables you're
eating what your height and weight is
what other drugs are on that all
combines to have warfarin be the single
best drug that we have for predicting
response based on the combination of
genetics and environmental factors the
other thing that I should have actually
mentioned right off the bat is there are
something between 30 and 50 million
Americans alone on this drug and
probably obviously twice that or more
internationally so what
about a hundred million people on this
drug there are new drugs coming out that
are hoping to knock it off as the leader
but today warfarin is still an
incredibly important drug worldwide and
so accurate dosing especially for a
dangerous drug like warfarin as you may
know warfarin is a anticoagulant and it
makes it harder to clot your blood
that's good if you've had a heart attack
it's good if you've had a stroke it's
good if you've had a clot in your lung
or in your legs but if you have too much
of it it can kill you with internal
spontaneous hemorrhage so there's this
very narrow range we have to get it
right and that's where the genetics can
help right it sounds like blood clotting
is obviously important when we cut
ourselves and we're bleeding but you
know if it's blocking our hearts that's
not so good well you mentioned that
there are so many people on warfarin the
variation in the human genome that
exists on the farm gkb site for example
does it sort of separate is it able to
document the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic pathway separately does
it combine them how do you how do you
present that it for me yeah so we those
are two separates good for you for
knowing about this and good for your
class in the case of warfarin there are
both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
Oh kinetic side that changed the rate at
which it's metabolized and one of the
most important genes is called cyp2c9
there's another one called a cyp for f2
but to see nine to take as an example
it's well known that if you're going to
metabolize warfarin more slowly you're
going to need less of it and and if you
take the normal dose when you're a slow
metabolizer you're going to wind up with
effectively an overdose and too much
bleeding there on the pharmacodynamic
side there's a gene again with a
terrible name it's called vkorc1 or
vitamin K oxido reductase component one
which is actually the target it's it's
that it's the protein which the drug
warfarin binds to to inhibit clotting
and there are some variations both
inside this gene but also in the control
regions of the gene that control its
expression that markedly change its
levels and there are some variations
that are
very important for determining warfarin
dose in that so it's a great story
because there's this one pd gene that
seems dominant this one PK gene that
seems dominant together you can come
darn close to predicting what the right
dose will be for an individual patient
even without needing to see them
clinically first that's right you it
does you do best if you have their age
because there are some age effects and
gender there's some sex effects of the
genetics and then ethnicity you would
hope that ethnicity would drop out
because you would hope that once we have
the genetic measurements who cares what
your ancestry is but I must say that our
ability to predict those for African
descent people is still not as good and
so in our lab we're working very hard
the hypothesis would be that there are
additional genetic variations seen in
that population that have not been
studied yet that with knowledge of those
will be able to get our level of
prediction for African descent people to
be as good as where we are now for
European and Asian descent that's
wonderful i want to ask you one more
question generically if somebody is
taking this course and they are super
excited about the idea of
pharmacogenetics pharmacogenomics what
advice would you give them to sort of
pursue this interest so as a patient or
as ur as a researcher learner as well do
both separately well so as a patient
there are increasingly companies out
there that are not only providing so I
know that your class knows about 23andme
that's not meant for clinical purposes
but the nonetheless the quality is quite
good and you could get a at least a
suggestion of what some of your drug
responses might be and now there are
more formal clinically approved testing
facilities that will check your genetics
and then give a report to your physician
that would allow them to that your
physician to make decisions about drug
dosing in terms of learning more there
are some conferences there's well I'm
the president of the american society
for clinical pharmacology which has an
annual conference where pharmacogenomics
is featured it's not the only thing but
it's one of the things at this
conference the American Society for
Human Genetics has a great conference
it's going to be in boston in 2013 that
makes this tape dated sorry it was in
boston and 2030
there are also actually this twitter
feeds and there are this is this
something called the genetics Alliance
which is a bunch of a patient grassroots
group that wants to see more genetics
used in medicine my friend Eric Topol in
San Diego has a great course on genomics
and medicine that he teaches down in San
Diego every year for clinicians and I
bet you there were some non clinicians
to attend that and then there are
conferences that kind of pop up all the
time so I think that's one way to do it
it's getting increasingly played in them
in the media because people it resonates
with people very much that their genetic
background would affect how they respond
to drugs so that it doesn't take long to
convince somebody that this is not an
unreasonable thing to think about and
unfortunately we don't know how our
parents one of the things that we don't
get from Grandma and Grandpa is how
they've responded to their drugs in
general and you inherit that just as you
inherit your height and your eye color
but that is often lost in the family law
and so genetics now gives us a chance to
recapture that so we can use it for the
patients benefit so tell me way of the
future and in medicine or not absolutely
so I would be disappointed if in the
next ten years I'm already aware of
local implementations of
pharmacogenetics and some of the leading
places st. Jude's Medical Center
Vanderbilt University of Maryland we're
trying to get things going here at
Stanford so I'm some of these places are
already giving trials I think those
trials will be successful and then
you'll start seeing it becoming kind of
a standard of care and at that point
there'll be a expectation that this is
part of the armamentarium in medicine
which will be incredibly exciting and
then all of this work we've been doing
putting it together to database writing
the guidelines will kind of have its
desired ultimate effect thank you so
much George shouting well it's my
pleasure thanks for doing it yeah of
course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
