from Denver for every city you would
compute its distance from Denver and
then you would build a histogram using
the techniques that you've already
studied and so a histogram is
essentially a binning operation right in
this case its bidding on distance the
one dimensional quantity of distance and
so although you would use a binning step
in the process of creating that
histogram it really wouldn't be using
the geographic binning that we discussed
a sort of two dimensional geographic
painting that we use to accelerate our
computation of which cities were within
300 kilometers of each other and so I
would answer this no I would say that
it's not useful to use that Geographic
binning to compute a histogram of City
distances even though this is still a
geographic problem and a bending problem
on the other hand if you have a list of
roads and each road is a list of line
segments you could easily imagine
launching a thread per road or a thread
per line segment and using that
Geographic bidding operation to compute
which bins which tiles which of the the
grid cells that line segment intersects
and computing the population of all
cities within that grid cell or nearby
grid cells so yes a geographic thinning
operation like we described would
accelerate this kind of operation and
finally here's a step where the
geographic bending is simply unnecessary
work right so if we have a list of
counties and we have a list of cities
that have already got a pointer to the
containing County that the city is in
then to compute the city dwelling
population of all the counties is simply
a matter of having every city update its
County so one of the points I wanted to
make here is that in fact every city is
in at most one County and so you already
sort of have a bin eventing in some
sense the county's sort of provide a
binning and so even though this isn't a
geographic or a spatial data structure
this this index of counties and and
pointers from cities the county's kind
of gives you a Benning and so it would
be redundant to apply an additional
binning step in this case so once again
this one is not really going to benefit
from the geographic getting operation
that we described</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
