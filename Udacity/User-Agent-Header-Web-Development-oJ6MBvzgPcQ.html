about user agents so it's one of the
most important headers in an HTTP
request and when we were doing reddit
user agents were really important to us
so we had the site that was online and
really popular and users were always you
know often writing scripts and stuff to
to pull content down and read it and
mostly they're you know mostly they're
doing good things they were building you
know tools to you know do data
collection so they can do some you know
cool blog posts about how read it works
and that sort of thing sometimes they're
doing bad things you know there are
spammers you know looking for weaknesses
or you know looking for ways to game the
system and user agents are important
because sometimes you know user would
hit us a little too hard too fast you
know basically you know hurting the
website for real users if they had a
legitimate user agent we could look at
them we can you know rate limit them
accordingly or we could reach out to
them and say hey you know you're hurting
us and you know they would adjust and
it's cool the Googlebot is a really good
example of this the Googlebot is
Google's web crawler that indexes
websites for you know their search
engine Google bot would just punish us
though it hit us as fast as they could
and sometimes I would actually slow down
the site and it's how we learned how to
handle that properly we would just you
know write them with them a little bit
and you know Googlebot you know their
feelings weren't hurt they can still
index a site we just made them do it
slower but when people show up with fake
user agents and we can tell that you
know this one IP and this one user agent
is just pummeling us and they're trying
to pretend to be a browser we would just
block them all together so using good
user agents when you're writing software
that interacts with other people's
websites is is a really nice courteous
thing to do and it's one of the things
that makes the web work well for
everybody so it's always important to
have a nice accurate user agent and to
be honest when you can okay now what I'd
like you to do is promise to always use
user agents appropriately when you're
writing your web software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
