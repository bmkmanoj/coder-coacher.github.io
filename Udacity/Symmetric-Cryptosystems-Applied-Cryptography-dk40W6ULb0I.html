is symmetric cryptosystems symmetric
means both encryption and decryption are
done with the same key I want to
introduce some terminology that we'll
use throughout the course so we can
think of encryption as a function and it
takes as input a plaintext this is the
unencrypted message it outputs a
ciphertext and that our goal is to be
able to send that ciphertext over an
insecure Channel this could be a
wireless network this could be the
Internet
this could be a courier carrying your
message any channel where we can't trust
the channel to be secure we hope what
comes out of the channel is the same
ciphertext we put into it then that goes
into a decryption function and what
comes out is the message that we sent it
our cast of characters we often talk
about Alice sending the message
Bob receiving it we also have malicious
characters who might be listening in on
this channel one of those is called Eve
for eavesdropper and she has really big
ears and can hear the messages sent
between Alice and Bob but she only hears
what's sent over the insecure Channel
she doesn't have access to the plaintext
that's the input to the encryption
function or the plaintext that comes out
of the decryption function at the other
end but she can hear the ciphertext that
sent over the insecure Channel to think
about this a little more precisely the
plaintext is some message and it's
selected from a set of messages so M is
the set of all possible messages and M
could be finite or infinite for a given
length M is finite and will often be
thinking about fixed length messages so
there's a finite set of them and M is
some message selected from that set the
ciphertext is C selected from the set of
all possible cipher texts and the
encryption and decryption functions are
functions the encryption function as
shown here is in a function that goes
from an element of M to an element of C
the decryption function goes from an
element of C a ciphertext to an element
of them in order for Bob to receive the
same message as the one Alice encrypted
we need this property that the D
function is
an inverse of the M function so we need
it to be the case for all messages the
result of decrypting the encryption of
that message is the same as the message
we started with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
