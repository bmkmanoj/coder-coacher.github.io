learning about exponential growth to
help her pandas out grant has also been
trying to figure out exponential
functions to help deal with his
company's investments in different bank
accounts suppose that grant wants to
invest $10,000 and the bank says you can
get three percent interest per year
compounded yearly grant feels confused
the bank explains that compounded
annually means that once a year the
total amount of money in the account is
calculated and then three percent of
that amount is added on top of the total
in interest let's start out by just
calculating this for the first three
years that Grant has the account I've
already written in all the information
that we have and really it's all that we
need to figure out the rest of this we
know that he starts out with ten
thousand dollars at the beginning of the
first year that he invests our interest
rate is three percent so that means that
point zero three times this amount will
be added to the account at the end of
the year point oh three times ten
thousand is three hundred ten thousand
plus 300 makes ten thousand three
hundred since this is the amount that's
present at the end of year one it's the
amount that's present at the beginning
of year too so your two starts off with
ten thousand three hundred what I would
like you to do right now is to fill in
the missing information in each of these
cells how much interest will be in the
second year and how much let give him at
the end of year to use that as the start
of year 3 and then calculate the new
amount of interest and then the new
total</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
