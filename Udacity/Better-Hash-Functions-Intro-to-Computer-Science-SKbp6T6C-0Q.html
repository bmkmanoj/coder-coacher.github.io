the first letter does not work very well
doesn't use enough buckets and it
doesn't distribute the keys well so now
we're going to think about how to make a
better hash function so we want the same
property we had before in the sense that
it's one function that takes two inputs
and the two inputs are the key word
which is a string and the number of
buckets which is a number those are the
two inputs and the output is the hash
value and it's in the range from zero to
number of buckets minus one and our goal
is for these numbers to be well
distributed so we can have any number of
buckets we want the key words will be
spread evenly among the buckets and
every time we hash the same keyword
we'll get the same bucket so we'll know
quickly where to find it so in order to
do better than we were doing before
we're gonna need to look at more than
just one letter the key word if we look
at just the first letter we're not going
to do better than having a limited
number of buckets and a bad distribution
so we want to do is something that's
going to look at all the letters of the
key word not just the first letter and
based on all the letters will decide
their appropriate bucket we saw that
with lists if we had a list of items we
could use the for loop construct to go
through the elements in the list like
this and this will go through each
element in P assigning it to the
variable E and executing whatever is in
the block for each element of P we can
do something similar with strings so if
we have a string s we can use the same
construct to go through the characters
in s so each time we go through the loop
the value assigned to variable C will be
a one letter string corresponding to
each character in the string in order so
first it will have the value A then the
value B then the value C then the value
D so this gives us a way to go through
all the elements in the string and if
you remember how he turned single letter
strings into numbers and modulo
arithmetic then I think you know enough
to define a much better hash function so
for this quiz your goal is to define a
function hash string that behaves like
this it takes a keyword a number of
buckets and it gives a number
identifying the bucket where that
keyword will belong but instead of just
using
first letter in the key word is going to
use all the letters and produces as
output a single number that represents
the bucket where that keyword bird
belongs and your goal is to do this in a
way that depends on all the characters
in the string not just the first
character there are lots of different
ways to do this so we're gonna specify
exactly what you should do so what we
want to do is make the output of hash
string a function of all the characters
and we can think of that with modular
arithmetic that if we have a circle
which is the size of the number of
buckets so this is going to go from zero
to the buckets minus one what we want to
do for each character we're going to
start at zero and for each character in
the string we're gonna go around Ord of
that character
distance around the circle and we're
gonna keep going so each character we're
going to go some distance around the
circle the circle can be any size
depending on the number of buckets and
we're going to keep going around the
circle using modular arithmetic for each
letter and as we keep going we can go
lots and lots of times if it's a big
word wherever we end up is gonna be the
bucket that we use and let's say that's
position twenty-seven who knows where it
is so that's the idea and I'll give you
a couple examples so you know if you're
implementing it the right way let's
suppose we have as our string the single
letter a and we have 12 buckets well in
that case we're going to have 12 buckets
we wouldn't have 27 here this is going
to be 11 is the last bucket the Ord
value of a is 97
so for a what we would do is go around
the circle eight times because 97 is 12
times 8
and one more because ninety seven is
twelve times eight plus one you don't
actually have to go around the circle if
you use the modulo that's what it will
give you and so the hash value for a
should end up in bucket one as another
example if we tried hash string where
the string is the single letter B also
with 12 buckets well that's going to
also go around the circle eight times
because the order of B is 98 but it's
gonna end up in bucket two since that's
96 plus two which will end up in bucket
two if we change the number of buckets
the results will be different so let's
say instead of having twelve buckets we
have 13 and we tried hash string on the
single letter string a with 13 buckets
the result there should end up being 6
and the reason at 6 is because 97 is
equal to 13 times 7 plus 6 so the size
of a hash table matters as well as the
string we don't want it to just work on
single letter strings with single letter
strings we're really getting the same
thing we defined before where it gets
interesting is where we have multi
letter strings so let's look at a few
examples like that so where we can see
the difference between what you're gonna
find at a string and the bad hash string
we had before is once we have longer
strings
so suppose we tried the string a u the
Ord of a was 97 and that when we went on
the circle ended up at location 1 the
Ord of you I can tell you is 117 when we
add those two we get 214 and modulo the
number of buckets which is 12 here we
should get 10 so that string with two
symbols doesn't end up in position one
where the a would end up it ends up in
bucket 10 and as another example we
won't work through the details on this
one but you'll be able to test if your
result is correct if you try the string
Udacity it should end up in bucket sorry
I forgot the input size this is very
important
we need two inputs to have string both
the string and the number of buckets
matter so here we're also assuming 12
buckets here we'll use 12 buckets again
the result should be 11 so see if you
can define a function half string that
does this and we want it to take these
two inputs and produce a number that
tells us what bucket that keyword should
be in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
