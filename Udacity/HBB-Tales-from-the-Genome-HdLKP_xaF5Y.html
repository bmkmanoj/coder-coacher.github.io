they carry oxygen to all the nooks and
crannies of your body an exchanger for
the waste product carbon dioxide now
hemoglobin is the actual protein
molecule responsible for directly
binding the oxygen inside your red blood
cells and if we exclude water hemoglobin
makes up over ninety-five percent of all
the cellular protein inside red blood
cells now hemoglobin itself is actually
a superstructure of multiple proteins
and mutations in any one of the
individual protein subunits has the
potential to cause serious problems
affecting one of the most fundamental
processes necessary for survival the
supply of oxygen one of the most
important proteins hemoglobin beta is
encoded by the hbb gene now in humans
hbb can be found on the eleventh
chromosome in the human genome now
chromosome 11 is about a hundred and
thirty four million base pairs long and
the hbv gene can be found somewhere
close to the end of it now the HPB gene
itself consists of three exons spanning
1,700 base pairs of DNA this is actually
kind of small in comparison to some of
the other genes we've looked at after
transcription and splicing the resulting
mRNA has 444 nucleotides of coding
region between the start and stop codons
and after translation we get a protein
with 147 amino acids remember we just
divided 444 by 3 the number of
nucleotides in a coat on and then
subtracted that number by 1 to get 147
because the last stop codon doesn't have
an amino acid it's just empty as you can
imagine this hbb protein hemoglobin beta
is pretty important and so that any
changes could have a drastic effect on
the overall function of the protein
there is one quite famous allele of the
hbb gene that ultimately changes the
structure of hemoglobin and the red
blood cell thus causing sickle cell
anemia now this particular allele
contains an a to T mutation and adding
to find me mutation at position 20 of
the coding region so using the genetic
code that we learned about in lesson 3
and which you can find in the
instructors notes on this page
I want you to determine the change in
the expected amino acid sequence from
the adenine to the thymine position and
then select the type of mutation that's
best used to describe the t allele from
the list here if you have any trouble
answering this just review mutations
from lesson six</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
