given any graph can we say that clever
VC will outperform our factor two
approximation algorithm this is actually
false well it seems like it outperformed
our factor two approximation algorithm
in each case we tested it in order to
actually verify that it will outperform
our other algorithm we either have to
test it against every possible graph
which is somewhat impossible or we would
have to give a mathematical proof that
clever VC will outperform our factor two
approximation algorithm in every
circumstance and since we haven't done
that we can't actually say that this is
true we also can't say with certainty
that clever VC is a factor 1.75
approximation algorithm and that's
because well we can't see the source
code at all if we can't see the code
then we can run tests and be more and
more certain whether or not it's a
factor 1.75 approximation algorithm but
we cannot be certain so we can't say
that this is true however we can say
with certainty that clever VC is not a
correct algorithm now why is that let's
look back at our table here now the key
thing to notice here is that the
algorithm were comparing clever VC
against is a factor two approximation
algorithm that means that each of these
numbers each of these minimum vertex
cover sizes is at most twice the actual
minimum vertex cover so let's think
about what that means that means that
the minimum vertex cover for the 10,000
vertice graph is actually at least 284
and let's go ahead and round up here
similarly the minimum vertex cover for
the 20,000 vertice graph must be at
least 117 for the 30,000 vertice graph
the minimum vertex cover has to be at
least 300 and this is the key right here
so the minimum vertex cover the absolute
minimum vertex cover of this graph has
to be at least 300 but clever VC is
saying it found one that is only 295 so
that means that this is wrong this
cannot possibly be if this is a factor
two approximation algorithm so either
this isn't actually a factor two
approximation algorithm
and let's say that we verify that it is
or this is not a correct algorithm for
finding the minimum vertex cover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
