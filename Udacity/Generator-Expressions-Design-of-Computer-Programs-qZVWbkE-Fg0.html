let's look at generator expressions
which is almost the same idea so the
syntax is the same in that a generator
expression consists of a term mandatory
for clause and then optional for and ifs
clause as many of those as you want zero
or more and there's two differences the
generator expression uses parentheses
instead of square brackets square
brackets mean that lists parentheses
means generator and then the other
difference is that the computation
doesn't get done all at once instead a
generator expression returns a value
which is a promise to do the computation
later
so if we say G equals this and then G is
this promise it hasn't done any
calculation yet hasn't calculated any of
the terms and then I can ask
give me the next G then it starts doing
the calculation and it keeps on looping
through the four clauses or maybe
multiple four clauses until it finds the
first term and returns that and then if
I want I can again ask for the next G
and it will give me the second one and
so on let's look at an example here I've
defined the function SQ for square of x
it takes in the value X prints out that
it's been called and returns x times X
and here I've defined a generator from
this generator expression it says return
square of X generates square of X for X
in range 10 if X mod 2 equals zero so
that's saying if X is an even number and
notice nothing has happened yet we
didn't get any printing of square was
called so Square hasn't been called yet
the generator function is this promise
we can look at it it says it's a
generator object but no computation has
been done yet now we can ask for the
next G and now finally Square gets
called with 0 as an argument and we
return 0 as a result we can do that
again we get 4:16 3664 and what do you
think is going to happen next so now
we're getting to the end of the end of
the loop range 10 means 0 through 9 so
there are no more so now when we ask for
the next one Python raises this
condition called stop iteration so
but saying I've gotten to the end I have
to stop the iteration because there's no
more I can give you I can't give you the
next one now this seems a little bit
inconvenient because now I've got these
errors and my program has to deal with
them but the idea is that you rarely
will be calling next directly rather
most the time you'll be doing this
within a four loop so I can say
something like this where I say 4x2 in
this expression do something and now the
protocol for a four loop arranges to
call the generator each time to call the
next function and to deal with the stop
iteration function or the stock hit
iteration exception and catch that and
so everything works fine
I can also convert the result so here
i've said i've got a generator
expression and i'm converting that into
a list it does all the work and then it
returns a result as a list so i never
have to deal explicitly with those stop
iterations now why do you think i chose
a generator expression to implement the
zebra puzzle do you think I wanted to
confuse students have less indentation
so that the code would fit on the page
stop early as soon as I found the first
result or make the code easier to edit
to move around the various pieces of the
constraints and so on so check all that
