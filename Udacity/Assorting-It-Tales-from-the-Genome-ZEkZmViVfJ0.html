can really be tricky is two possible
combinations of alleles let's take a
look at why that is remember just like
before we're going to have our first
division and we're going to separate our
pairs of chromosome 2 so great we
separated them well the alleles are
already all connected here on the single
chromosome split so it doesn't matter
what happens with our chromosome fours
in this case we could go to either side
it doesn't matter they're not going to
change your I allelic combinations so
let's just even remove them all together
now let's actually take a look okay
let's split these and split bees we've
got plus minus combination plus minus
combination for lactase persistence in
tourism and then minus plus or recessive
dominant combinations over here for
lactase persistence in dwarfism so
that's two combinations okay well let's
go back and see if we split them to the
other side they went to different sides
during the cell division oh and then we
split them again and you'll notice that
it doesn't matter these alleles are
traveling together in fact it appears
that these alleles are physically linked
together on the same chromosome this is
a real problem for increasing genetic
diversity looking the possible
combinations of alleles for just two
different genes we've now cut the number
of combinations we could get in half
because everybody's linked together on
the same chromosome the cell actually
has a solution to this problem to help
us maximize allelic variation in
combinations even when genes are linked
on the same chromosome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
