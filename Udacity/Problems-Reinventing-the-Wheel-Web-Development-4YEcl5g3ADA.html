own HTML escaping function and then
promptly showed you that you didn't
actually have to do that because it's
already built in the Python
well the exercise is important because
now you know what actually goes into the
escaping function that's built in the
Python but you should probably use the
one that's built in because it's been
written by professionals and seen by
thousands of people and used in
production so it's probably pretty safe
if you don't use the safe one sometimes
you can run into trouble like we did at
reddit once so we had our own HTML
escaping function nearly identical to
the one you just wrote except it had a
few extra features in it because we had
a few extra features in our comment
pages now we at one point rewrote this
function in C from Python because C is
much faster and we needed that function
to be particularly fast well when we
open sourced reddit we did a quick scan
of our code for security holes and we
weren't too concerned about this because
most of reddit is written in Python
which is a fairly secure simple language
C that's not quite the same case so on
the day we open sourced reddit somebody
found a security hole and our HTML
escaping function that we wrote and C
there's only like 20 lines but within
there there was a hole and it was super
embarrassing we fixed it right away but
it just goes to show you know unless you
have a really good excuse you should
probably just use the built-in functions
otherwise you're going to end up looking
like the works like we did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
