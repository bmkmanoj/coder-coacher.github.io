problem of vision we have to think a
little bit about what feature space we
do this in all right and it turns out
for an awful lot of what we do in
clustering and segmentation and frankly
just about everything in computer vision
the feature space you use is what
matters so here I'm showing you that
single line with the idea being that
we're just grouping along a single
intensity space so if i were to cluster
using just this simple intensity space
what would it do to this panda picture
and professor ramen and texas she's got
things this thing for pandas actually i
think she got these pictures somewhere
well so let's see so here's our panda if
I tell it that there's going to be two
centers okay then I would get a division
that looks like this right so you can
see that basically the lighter pixels
have been turned into one region and the
darker pixels have been turned into
another region all right now if I told
it instead there were three clusters you
might get something that looks like this
all right and here you can see there's
the bright the dark and the grey all
right kind of like the good the bad and
the ugly so what you're seeing here
right away is one of the problems in
doing k-means clustering we'll talk more
about this is that you have to tell it
how many clusters there are and there
are methods for then trying to figure
that out beyond that but fundamental the
k-means is you already know the number
of clusters when you do this type of
clustering you can think of this as
quantizing the feature space right so
those of you familiar with vector
quantization if you do it in
multi-dimensional space the idea is you
essentially carve a continuous space up
into a set of buckets so this segment
this clustering is a quantization of our
feature space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
