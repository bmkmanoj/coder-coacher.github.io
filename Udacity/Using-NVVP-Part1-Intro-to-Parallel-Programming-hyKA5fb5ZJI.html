tool it has a lot of functionality we're
only going to touch on it today my real
point is simply to point out to you that
these tools exist and that even though
in this class we're gonna focus on
understanding the concepts and being
able to reason about these things from
scratch I do want you to understand that
that you don't have to always do this
from scratch that you should use the
tools that are available so the first
thing we're gonna do is pick an
executable to run on and so this is
where we tell it what executable to run
we're gonna run our transpose code
before we do that I'm actually going to
go into the transpose code and comment
out the section of it that is of running
the transpose serial kernel that first
kernel that we figured out that one is
so slow that I don't really want to
spend any more time on that and as
you'll see the profiler takes a little
time to run the code several times and
acquire statistics about it
so I comment that out and save it I go
back and I recompile my code and now I'm
ready to go back to in vvp tell it what
executable we're gonna run and here we
go it runs the program it measures all
of the calls to the CUDA API things like
malloc and mem copy and it measures the
time taken for every kernel here's the
transpose parallel per row kernel let me
zoom in on that you can see that the
parallel per row kernel started one
hundred ten milliseconds into the
execution of the program finished 119
milliseconds into the program ran a
single block had a grid size of 1 1 1 so
it launched a single block that block
had 1024 threads you can get a bunch of
other statistics from this if we scroll
to the right we can see the much shorter
time taken by our transpose per element
kernel I'll zoom in even further and
this one as you see ran into grits in a
larger grid of 64 by 64 blocks each of
which had 16 by 16 threads now I'll make
the point that we measured a shorter
time than that the times that you see in
the profiler are not going to match up
exactly to the timings that we measured
a little bit ago when we were outside
the profiler and that's to be expected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
