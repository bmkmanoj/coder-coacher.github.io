the app here are the Java classes the
dinner class has methods for figuring
out what dinner to suggest the main
activity shows the main screen to start
with the main screen only has this one
button what's for dinner and when you
press the button it fires off an intent
to the show dinner activity so the
dinner shows here and then you get these
buttons and each of these buttons fires
off an intent to start the appropriate
activity so for example the show recipe
button sends an intent to start the show
recipe activity and actually choose
again does not have a corresponding
activity it just has a method inside the
class now this class here the use
infobox fragment is a fragment that
simply displays an info box and a
heading this lets you reuse the fragment
wherever you need it and help simplify
the code and for example the sure recipe
activity the remove meal activity the
order dinner activity all these
activities use this fragment the app has
a couple of menus there's the main menu
which just shows the settings but
actually we're not going to use the
settings in this application more
interestingly the food prefs menu
displays a list of food options this
pop-up is used whenever we want to let
the user choose their food preference
there's one other quick thing I want to
mention in the intro lesson to this
course you learned how to implement the
unconnected code to use the Google API
client library however for both Google
Analytics and Google tag manager you do
not need to implement any code to use
the Google API client library all the
app needs is to specify the version of
the client library in the Android
manifest like this and to specify the
dependency on Play services in the build
Gradle file and these dependencies have
already been set up for you in the
watford in a sample app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
