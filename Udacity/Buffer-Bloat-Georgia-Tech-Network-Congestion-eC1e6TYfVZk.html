about buffer bloat we saw an example of
buffer bloat in the last lesson where we
explored the latency effects of power
boost in the example that we explored
the sender could send a rate R that was
bigger than the sustained rate R without
seeing packet loss now if there's a
buffer in the network that can support
this higher rate what we'll see is that
buffer will start filling up with
packets but this buffer can still only
drain at the sustained rate R so even
though the sender might be able to send
at a faster rate for a brief period of
time in terms of throughput all of those
packets that the sender sent at that
faster rate are queued up in line
waiting to be sent as these packets are
waiting in this buffer they'll see
higher delays than they would see if
they simply arrived at the front of the
queue and could be sent immediately the
delay that the packet will see in the
buffer is the amount of data in the
buffer divided by the rate that the
buffer can drain these large buffers can
introduce delays that ruin the
performance for time critical
applications such as voice and video
these large buffers actually show up all
over the place in home routers in home
Wi-Fi devices or access points in hosts
on device drivers and also in switches
and routers let's take an example of
buffer bloat that we observed in home
routers as part of the Bismark study
that I described in the last lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
