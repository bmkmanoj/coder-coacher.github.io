here in there to jump around the editor
and get different things done I'm doing
this on a Mac thus I'm going to use the
command key a lot but most shortcuts
work just as well in Windows by
substituting command with control
searching and finding matters a lot to
me hitting command T will bring up the
fuzzy file finder the search box
forgives many spelling mistakes or
missions so jumping from file to file
gets lightning fast most developers
prefer this method over manually
searching for a previously open tab as
this involves 0 mouse input and no
thinking about the tap position it's a
perfect example of an action that looks
more complex than clicking on a tab but
is actually faster and simpler typing an
@ symbol into that box or directly
typing command R will bring up the
simple search menu this allows you to
quickly locate stuff in the current file
and it works extremely well for CSS or
JavaScript functions now I know I use
this color somewhere else in the CSS
file and I want to quickly locate it so
I have it already selected and on my
keyboard I'm going to hit command alt +
G and it finds the next instance of it
sublime text has a very powerful tab
completion feature in a nutshell tab
completion allows you to type a whole
lot less and typing less usually
resulting you're finishing faster so if
I go into my HTML file and type in IMG
and hit tab it expands it out to the
full image tag notice how not only it
created an image tab with the most
important attributes for us it also
placed a cursor in the right position
for us to enter information in many
editors support multiple selection these
days that's the ability to have multiple
selections in the same document that
aren't next to each other but most of
the time folks show that off with column
selection which can be done by holding
the Alt key and dragging your cursor
around it sure looks cool but the use
cases for it are so rare that I almost
never use it so let's see how we can do
this
sublime way so i have this word color
right here selected and have press
command D and it shows us the next
instance of that word without clearing
the selection of the first and it
doesn't stop there command ctrl G
selects all instances of the word
throughout the whole file you can think
of it as a global selection so this
makes it very easy for us to quickly
