exponential time complete which means
it's provably harder than any problem in
NP even on a non-deterministic machine
and the proof does not depend on whether
P equals NP are not the proof is certain
roadblock is harder than any problem in
NP so it's harder than say vertex cover
now why is that why can't
non-determinism help us to solve
roadblock well it can help us but it
apparently can't help us enough to make
this problem solvable in NP so there's
several ways to explain this and one of
the differences between NP and problems
that are harder than in p is that an NP
or more concretely in a problem like
vertex cover you're dealing with a
static input you're given one graph and
for that graph you're trying to solve
one question and that question is do you
have a vertex cover of a certain size
asking for an optimal strategy in a game
like roadblock is a bit different
because this game is played against a
player so the question kind of is after
player 1 has made a move what can player
to do and player 2 of course has a
number of possible reactions to what
player 1 has done you need to take all
of these possibilities into
considerations how player one makes the
second move or the third move always
depends on what player 2 is doing in
between and that is why this problem
here is intuitively exponential time
complete because after every move that
player one makes you have to consider
all of the possibilities that player 2
makes and there's no way around that
instead of here where we can just guess
a small vertex cover there's a
description for this that is a little
bit more formal you can say that NP is
kind of the set of problems that have a
short proof and by short I mean a
polynomial-time verifiable proof so for
example for vertex cover when I tell you
I have a vertex cover that only uses
five vertices and you ask me please show
me that vertex cover well I can just
specify those five vertices to you and
you can check yourself that they will
make up a vertex cover for the input
graph now for a game like roadblock that
is not that easy because if you said
player one can always win this game and
I ask you I want a proof of that
then we again get into this situation
that the proof of the optimal strategy
is exponential in size because that
proof will basically start out by saying
okay this is the first move that player
one should make but then there's a
couple of reactions that player 2 could
have to that move so let's say it
branches out so this is what player 1 is
doing and this is what player 2 is doing
now for each of these reactions of
player 2 I would again in this proof
have to specify what player one is
supposed to do but then as you see it
branches out player 2 again has a number
of possible reactions that it can have
to this move for roadblock if you think
of this as a large search tree it
doesn't suffice to show that there's
just one single path that leads to a
solution but basically you have to show
that any path here in this tree always
leads to player 1 winning now so for
vertex cover or any other problem in NP
and of course this is again talking very
informally it suffices to show one path
in the search tree whereas for a problem
like roadblock the proof that for
example player 1 can always win would
require you to show the whole search
tree and not just a single path and that
is why problems such as roadblock are
provably harder than problems in NP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
