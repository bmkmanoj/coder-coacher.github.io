driven model we will now talk about the
flash paper flash is an event-driven web
server that follows the ampat model so
basically it has a symmetric helper
processes to deal with the blocking guy
operations in the discussion so far we
really describe the architecture of
flash so it's uses helper processes for
blocking i/o operations and then
everything else is implemented as an
event dispatcher with handlers
performing different portions of the web
servicing tasks given that we are
talking about a web server and this is
the old fashioned web 1.genares.net disk
patcher is performed via pipes the
helper reads the file in memory via the
EM map call and then the dispatcher
checks the an operation min core if the
pages of the file are in memory and it
then uses this information to decide if
it should just call one of the local
handlers or if it should pass the
request to the helper as long as the
file is in memory reading it it's one
result in in a blocking I operation and
so passing it to the local handlers is
perfectly okay although this is an extra
check that has to be performed before we
read any file it actually results in big
savings because it prevents the full
process from being blocked if it turns
out that a blocking I operation is
necessary now we will outline some
additional detail regarding some of the
optimization that flash applies and this
will help us later understand some of
the performance comparisons the
important thing is that these
optimizations are really relevant to any
web server first of all flash performs
application level caching at multiple
levels and it does this on both data and
computation what we mean by this is it's
common to cache files this is what we
call date akashic however in some cases
it makes sense to cash
computation so in the case of the web
server the requests are requests for
some files these files need to be
repeatedly looked up so we need to find
the file traverse the directory look up
some of the directory data structures
that processing will compute some
results so some location some path name
for the file and we will just catch that
we don't have to recompute that and look
up the same information next time a
request for that same file comes in
similarly in the context of web
processing the HTTP header that files
have that are returned to the browser
it's really going to depend on the file
itself so a lot of the fields in there
are file dependent given that the file
doesn't change the header doesn't have
to change so this is another type of
application level caching that we can
perform and flash does this also flash
the some optimizations that take
advantage of the networking card parent
of the network interface card for
instance all of the data structures are
aligned so that it's easy to perform DMI
operations without copying data
similarly they use DMA operations that
have scatter gather support and that
really means that the header and the
actual data don't have to be aligned one
next to another in memory they can be
sent from different memory locations so
there is a copy that's avoided all of
these are very useful techniques and are
now fairly common optimizations however
at the time the paper was written
they're pretty novel and in fact some of
the systems they compared against did
not have some of these things included</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
