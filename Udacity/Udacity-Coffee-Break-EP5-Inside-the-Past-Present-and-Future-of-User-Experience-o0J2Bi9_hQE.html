coffee break welcome my name is Chelsea
Glasson I'm lead user experience
researcher if you recognize my voice
it's likely because I've interviewed you
in the past and I'm Karen Dempsey I'm in
marketing and likely you do not
recognize my voice
here at Udacity we take user experience
your experience as students very
seriously
and speaking of user experience we
actually held a special panel discussion
this past week with some very very much
heavyweights in user experience and we
thought that it would be insightful to
show you some clips you'll hear them
talk a lot about user experience careers
in the clips I attended it and not in
the field but I found it really
fascinating I learned a lot and I did
too I've worked in user experience for a
few years now but they were definitely
several key takeaways for me and I think
it's applicable to people in any it's
it's universal any career yeah great so
enjoy happy coffee break what advice
would you give to UX people who are
maybe looking to transition into a UX
job of their dreams or into the field
all together so you've talked a little
bit about you know things that you can
do and skills but like say like you get
this email from somebody saying I really
want to get a job at your company what
what do I need to do take a look at my
resume what what should I do
these days I mean you need to be a lot
more crafty about how you approach the
problem because design these days
there's so many different facets to
there's so many different ways to do it
and there's so many different companies
you know doing different things with it
and I think to do a long term plan for
your to your like think about five years
like where do you want to be and the
best way that I've done that is it's
actually thinking about heroes and
thinking about ways to emulate careers
and finding somebody you could think
like do you want to be an Irene in you
know ten years do you want to be at
Chelsea five years do you wanna be isara
because we all have very similar jobs
but they're all so radically different
and if I hadn't done the digging does
she figure that out and then I think
doing an interplay with yourself as well
as I'm like I think I'm this person
going to me of them kind of test myself
against that idea and I'm like I I
thought I was that person but now that
I've actually met that person I'm
actually not that person and it's a
design project you know I was like I had
a hypothesis I tested it sometimes it
worked and sometimes it blew up but all
that I got out of that was I learned
more about who I was and I learn more
about the jobs that are out there I
think being a t-shaped professional is
really important you know having a
really deep craft that you're a master
of but the flexibility to be broad in
another area whatever you're passionate
at get deep in but have the flexibility
to be broad in one area at least I think
it's a losing strategy to be a purist
and say I only do this or I only do this
this way it's you know the technology
landscape the customer behavior
landscape is changing too fast to do
things in a fixed way we have to be
really adaptable so I really encourage
people to be clear on what they're best
at you'd be adaptable and be open to
doing things differently but who really
determines and influences influences
what that product will be is you guys is
the designer who interprets the
solutions from the p.m. or even from
themselves or even from the engineers
and puts that together so the better you
get at storytelling like they were
saying the better you're able to put
together exactly what you want to pitch
the more influential you will be and be
able to get those ideas out and make a
better product for everybody else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
