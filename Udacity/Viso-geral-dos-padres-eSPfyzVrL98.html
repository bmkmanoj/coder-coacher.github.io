going to learn well we'll learn about
filtering patterns will learn about
summarization patterns and something
we'll call structural patterns and these
are all just frameworks for using
MapReduce to solve problems that you've
probably encountered as a programmer
before filtering patterns so filtering
problems like sampling data or maybe
even generating some top n list maybe
top 10 something summarization patterns
solve summarization problems getting a
high-level view of your data things like
counting records finding min and Max
then calculating basic statistical
values like mean median and mode we can
also use these patterns to create an
index finally these structural patterns
will solve structural problems and the
one we'll focus on in this lesson is
combining two data sets and just to warn
you this lesson will go fast and that
means you probably won't remember
everything about all of these patterns
totally okay not expected the point of
this lesson is for you to know that
these patterns exist and that if you
ever find yourself in a situation with
big data where you say ah this problem
is really just a filtering or a
summarization problem you'll know where
to look to find a technique to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
