acronyms describing many of the
different protocols out there for
implementing Web API s in this video
let's do some side-by-side comparisons
in order to determine which technology
is best for what we want to accomplish
soap and rest have both been proven as
two viable options for implementing a
web service soap was originally
developed by Microsoft in 1998 for soap
we are obliged to use XML for our data
structures but can choose HTTP or
another underlying application level
protocol rest was more of a description
than a development project the acronym
first appeared in a dissertation by Roy
Thomas fielding in the year 2000 rest
uses the HTTP verbs in order to access
and manipulate resources but can use any
type of messaging protocol to structure
the data at sins in order for an
application to be truly restful it must
adhere to a set of constraints fielding
defined in his dissertation so it seems
we still have two good options but let's
take a look at the popularity of the two
implementation options over the years
from this data gathered by programmable
web we see that rest has gained an
astounding popularity over the past
decade a major reason for this is
because rest is generally easier to
implement than soap and for web
developers working with HTTP is already
a familiar practice for these reasons
this course will focus on designing
restful Web API s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
