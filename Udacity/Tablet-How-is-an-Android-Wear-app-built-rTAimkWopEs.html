application design is that while the
watch is acting is a display to push
notifications to the user much of the
work is actually done on the phone
Android wear devices do not connect to
the internet directly and instead they
typically communicate with the outside
world via the paired up phone using
Bluetooth or Wi-Fi another important
thing to note is that Android wear
applications are embedded inside the
regular phone APK from google play the
user will download the phone APK and it
will be installed to the phone the
Android wear companion app that runs on
the phone will then detect an embedded
wearable apk and copy it over to the
Android wear device and install it there
too whenever the phone APK is updated on
the Play Store this process is repeated
for the Android wear device so the nice
part about this that if someone is using
your app and they add an Android wear
device it will automatically support it
if it's available what this does mean is
that you must create an application that
runs on the phone because a wearable app
cannot exist without it even if the
phone app does nothing you still need to
provide one otherwise Google Play cannot
process and distribute your apk file
here are some other things that are also
important to know the phone APK an
embedded wearable APK must have the same
package name and version numbers the
permissions requested by the wearable
APK must also be requested by the phone
APK as well and the phone APK and
wearable apks both need to be signed by
the same developer keys if you get any
of these things wrong the wearable app
will fail to install so be careful here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
