arithmetic was a pretty interesting
problem the digital camera in your
smartphone takes pictures where the red
green and blue values can be any number
between 0 and 255
that's 256 possibilities for red the
same for green and for blue and that's
millions of possibilities giving you
pretty big files now here on planet
earth that's not a problem but here in
our rocket ship that's exploring a
distant planet and it wants to send
photos back maybe a lesser range of
colors
what perfectly suffice so I'd like to
cut down this range into the much
smaller range from 0 to 5 and I'd like
to do that in a uniform way what I mean
with that is that if I look at the
interval of numbers between 0 and 255
that approximately one-sixth of them
should map to 0 the next 1/6 to 1 the
next one 6 to 2 and so on here's a way
of doing that
first off multiplied by 6 and then
divide by the length of this interval
that why all the numbers in here will be
0 all the numbers in here will be 1 here
there will be 2 and in the last region
there will be 5 now I'll give you a
number of choices for the Java code for
doing this and I'm asking you to pick
the right one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
