procedure that sees into the mind of a
finite state machine given a definition
for non deterministic finite state
machine we're going to use our crystal
ball of python code to read into the
mind of the finite state machine and
output any string if the exists one that
is accepted by that finite state machine
this sounds like some pretty powerful
stuff but believe it or not you have all
the tools to this so here I have an
outline for a finite state machine and I
didn't bother to label any of the edges
and let's just add a few more for fun
the strategy we're going to use is
starting from the starting state we're
going to follow every edge and as long
as we don't visit a node that we've
already visited we're going to continue
along until we reach an accepting state
we're then going and go back building up
a string that goes the other way so the
last character is going to be this edge
the second Alaska's will be this one and
the third the last will be this one yeah
there are strings that would match if we
went here and then kind of looped at the
three for a while but the question only
asks us to give one and this is the best
way to do it we do have to take into
account the issue of kind of an infinite
loop how do we know that we're never
going to finish never going to reach the
accepting state and I hinted at that
earlier we're just going to avoid
revisiting the same node over and over
again because all we care about is
making forward progress in this one I
could follow the one over and over again
just looping around forever but I'll
never reach the accepting stayed too so
what I'm going to say is if I follow the
edge back to the one I haven't made any
progress so I want to stop following
edges from the one all along that path
if they're so existed a second edge that
led from the one the two I would take
that immediately and go right to the two
so I can ignore the looping forever so
hopefully you're still with me now I'm
going to walk you through believe it or
not the recursive solution to this
problem so here i have the decoration
for my procedure the inputs are the
current state
the representation of our machine the
accepting states and the states that we
visited so far and as a reminder what
we're going to return is none if we
reach a failure point otherwise we're
going to start returning the edge that
led us to this state or more precisely
the next state and build up the string
as we go backwards from the accepting
state okay okay let's go right to the
base case if we've already visited this
node we're not making forward progress
and this isn't going to lead us to the
accepting state so we're going to return
none if we're currently in an accepting
state then we're going to return the
empty string we don't need to operate on
any more edges to reach the accepting
state here I'm adding the current state
to what's going to be the new list of
visited States and here I'm looking up
all the outgoing edges from the current
state and for each outgoing edge we find
we're going to recurse with the new
state in the new list of visited states
is following that path eventually leads
us back to something we've already
visited or if there are no outgoing
edges basically if we failed then foo
will be none if it's not none that means
we found something we found an accepting
state so we're going to start returning
our string and so the string 1 return is
the character that I followed to the new
state plus the string that was returned
by recursive call this string represents
all the characters that took to get from
new state to the accepting state this
could be an empty string it could be a
hundred different characters it doesn't
really matter and in case there are no
outgoing edges as I mentioned before
we're going to return none as well
that's it 13 lines of code to read the
mind of a finite state machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
