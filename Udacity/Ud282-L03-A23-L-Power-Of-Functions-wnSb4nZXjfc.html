that can do three main things when they
work as a black box
which means that they contain and
execute multiple lines of code without
you having to know what that code is -
they can take in data as arguments and
work with that data and three they can
return data and then their output can be
treated just like you would treat any
other variable and the black box is
often what makes functions so powerful
because without having to know all the
code inside a function you can employ
all its code just by calling the
function by name and giving it any
parameters that it requires this is
especially useful whenever you want to
use functions that someone else has
written hey you say then I overheard you
talking about black boxes look what I've
built here cool what does it do well all
you need to know is that it takes bread
as an input I happen to have some bread
right here perfect okay I'll try it out
all right now we just wait to see the
results and there we go
oh cool it makes a sandwich yep all the
details about how the black box actually
makes the sandwich is not important all
you need to know is that it takes bread
as an input that's kind of like the
functions we've been using we've been
using functions like math functions and
print line without having to know their
inner workings yeah but how do you know
what input each function needs like
strings for print line function well
just like you told me to put bread
inside this Java will tell us if
functions require certain parameters as
input and this information is actually
contained in Java documents which we'll
learn all about next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
