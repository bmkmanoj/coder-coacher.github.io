architectural styles there are many many
many architectural styles so we cannot
cover them all here what I want to do
instead is I want to mention a few of
those and then I want to go in more
depth on one of them so the first thing
I want to mention is pipes and filters
and pipes and filters indicate an
architectural style in which a chain of
processing elements which can be
processes threads coroutines is arranged
so that the output of each element is
the input of the next one and usually
with some buffering in between
consecutive elements a typical example
of this if you're familiar with UNIX or
UNIX pipes that you can use to
concatenate UNIX command another style
one to mention is the event-driven one
and even driven system typically
consists of event emitters like the
alarm over here and event consumers like
the fire track down here and consumers
are notified when events of interest
occur and have the responsibility of
reacting to those events
a typical example will be a GUI in which
widgets generate events and listeners
listen to those events and react to them
for example they react to the push of a
button a very commonly used
architectural style is published
subscribe represented by The Paperboy
over here and this is an architectural
style in which senders of messages that
are called publishers do not send
messages directly to specific receivers
instead they publish messages with one
or more Associated tags without
knowledge of who will receive such
messages similarly subscribers will
express interest in one or more tags and
will only receive messages of interest
according to such tags a typical example
of the publish/subscribe system will be
Twitter and I'm pretty sure the most of
you are familiar with the client-server
architecture in which computers in a
network assume one of two roles the
server provides the resources and
functionality and the client initiates
contact with the server and requests the
use of those resources and functionality
also in this case a typical example will
be email in which an email server
provides email storage and management
capabilities and an email client will
use those capabilities you may also be
familiar with peer-to-peer or p2p
systems a p2p system is a type of
decentralized and distributed network
system in which individual nodes in the
network that are called peers act as in
the
the agents that are both suppliers and
consumers of resources this is in
contrast to the centralized
client-server model where client nodes
interact with the central authority and
I'm not going to say anything more about
peer-to-peer because I'm going to show
you two examples of peer-to-peer systems
in the rest of the lesson and you
probably have at least heard of rest
which in this case is not an invitation
to relax as the graphic might indicate
but rather stands for representational
state transfer the rest is a hybrid
architectural style for distributed
hypermedia systems that is derived from
several other network based
architectural styles and that is
characterized by a uniform connector
interface and even if I'm not going to
say anything else about rest I wanted to
mention it because it is an extremely
well-known architectural style and the
reason for this is that rest is very
widely used because it is basically the
architectural style that governs the
world wide web so we use it all the time
when we browse the internet for instance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
