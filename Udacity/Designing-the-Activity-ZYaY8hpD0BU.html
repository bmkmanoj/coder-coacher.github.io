going to build over the next few minutes
it's a simple app that gives you your
latitude and your longitude helping you
to accurately position yourself on the
globe now as you can imagine there's
lots of great uses for this kind of
information one of the first mobile apps
I personally ever built was for dog
walkers they would run the app when they
walk the dog for someone else so that
the dog's owner could see the path of
the walk it worked by taking a very
accurate latitude and longitude reading
every few seconds in this case of course
we're just taking it once but let's see
how you would do that let's see how
you'll get that type of information in
the previous lesson we were getting
continuous updates on the location but
in this one we're going to do it a
little differently we're going to get
the latitude and longitude only once
upon connection now I think it's
important to learn by doing so we're
going to learn how to build this
application by stepping through what
needs to be done little by little so if
you haven't already done so open android
studio and create a new project give it
a name in this case i'm calling it
location 21 and you're going to pick it
to have a single blank activity so you
can see here in this option i'm going to
say blank activity i'm going to give it
a single blank activity and I'm going to
keep all the defaults and when Android
studio is finished doing its thing
you'll have your project created for you
and the activity generally by default is
opened but if it isn't just find the
layout folder and look for activity main
within that folder and you can see this
is the basic hello world layout that's
created for you so what we're going to
do is we're going to just take a look at
the text for this and we can see in here
there's a text view simply containing
the words hello world in the next couple
of steps we're going to change this to
update it for the UI that we showed in
the demonstration just a moment ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
