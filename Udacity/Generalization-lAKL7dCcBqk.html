how are you doing Charles I'm doing
great guess who stopped by the studio
this morning our TA from last year
yes pushkar stopped by and he brought me
ice cream which I am eating oh good for
you mm-hmm just like old times
all the times not just the old times mmm
say that's fair so we're gonna talk
about the day well actually kind of in
that same vein this sort of idea that
every time that we record
Pushkar seems to bring you ice cream as
an example of generalization oh well
boom thanks I can make predictions about
what might happen next time we record
together based on generalizing from the
past times that we've eaten together
even though it's kind of a different
state and so the idea of generalization
is going to be to leverage learning in
states where we've been to try to make
predictions about states where we didn't
haven't been or haven't been very often
sounds interesting so this will allow us
to teach exes how to swim for example
looking at your picture you don't like
my pictures the idea the picture here is
that we've got like actual data points
these five exes but then we use this
notion of generalization to kind of make
predictions at places where we don't
have data so it's machine learning yes
actually very good point cool all right
well I look forward to it so this is the
machine learning part or the
generalization part of reinforcement
learning excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
