because even though there was some hint
that you had to use trigonometry it
might not have been completely clear
what triangle we're talking about and
this is the triangle I was looking at
this one in purple and here turns out
the side opposite alpha is the width of
the well which is one meter and the side
adjacent to alpha is the depth of the
well which is 40 meters so once again as
often happens in nature we were able to
find a right triangle even though it
wasn't totally obvious at the start of
the problem that it existed okay so we
have a right triangle I know the
opposite in the adjacent which means I'm
going to use tangent and I'm going to
say the tangent of alpha is equal to
well one over 40 now I want to know
what's alpha well to figure this out I'm
going to type into Google arctan of 1
over 40 in degrees and the answer I get
is 1.4 degrees so this points to some
error in the measurement it looks like
we could have been off by as much as one
point four degrees in either direction
the sons where he could have been coming
like this or it could have come like
that that's certainly an appreciable
error since the angle we had been
getting with before was only seven point
two degrees but how does this error in
angle correspond to an error in
calculated circumference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
