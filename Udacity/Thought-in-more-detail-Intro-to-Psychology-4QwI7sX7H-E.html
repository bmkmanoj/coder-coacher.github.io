bit about culture language and thought
and now we're going to jump to focusing
on thought in more detail first we're
going to begin by looking at thinking
reasoning and decision making but
there's a couple words you should know
before we start so here we have
cognition cognition is the mental
processes involved in acquiring
processing and storing knowledge if you
remember from lesson 1 we talked about
cognitive psychology which is the study
of how people perceive remember think
and solve problems when you're at home
on the couch relaxing and thinking about
a vacation you want to take or the great
movies you saw last week or even
thinking about a new way to solve
problems you may encounter what's
happening how are you able to do that
did you ever stop to wonder what was
going on in the brain that is how do we
use our brains to solve and maintain
these mental processes so thinking is
our cognition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
