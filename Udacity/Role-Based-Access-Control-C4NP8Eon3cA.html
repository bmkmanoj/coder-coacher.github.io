called role based access control role
sort of is you know what you do your
function perhaps that may govern what
kind of files you can access if your
Human Resources or payroll or you are in
a different department the set of files
you you can access would depend on what
your role in the in the organization is
so there is role based access control or
our back that is implemented it's a
little different so I thought we'll just
spend just a couple of minutes talking
about it in roll back access control
remember rights are for being able to
access certain resources so those access
rights those are associated with the
role they're not associated with the
user so the way to think about the way
you can define your your policy access
control policy is going to say what
roles do I have in my system and for
each role what kind of resources do they
need to have access to so I would say
you know people in this role can read
these files or write these files and
things like that so this part of the
policy basically says you know access
rights are defined for roles and users
who are going to log into the system or
authenticate themselves to the system
can then take on some roles so our back
the way to think about this is that we
don't have direct access rights for
users users must be activated to one or
more roles and once they assume one or
more roles based on what those roles you
know give them access to that's what the
user or the process running on this
behalf of this user can access so we
talked an enterprise setting access may
be based on job function or role of a
given user that's where this might make
sense project manager may have access to
all files developers or people doing QA
or something like that may access files
in different way and so on payroll
manager and your HR function may be able
to look at files that have people
salaries and so on because their payroll
manager and things like that so this is
how roles will be defined access rights
associated with roles as we said before
and users when authentication happens
and we know the user is who's logging
into the system we have to
then sort of start with authentication
but then be able to activate one or more
roles for them okay so role activation
is is something else that has to be
added to this process the policy defined
here and sort of they're two stages
activating a role for a user and based
on that deciding what the user can
access now there are some benefits that
come when we have always two access
controls what could be some of these
benefits so first of all we said our
policy defines what roles have what kind
of access for resources in the system so
the policy doesn't need to change when
let's say certain person leaves the
organization policy is associated with
roles it's not associated with users so
users coming or going they don't require
changes to the policy the organization
has when a new employee comes basically
we think about what role is appropriate
for them and as soon as we decide their
role based on their function and what
resources they should have access to
automatically happens because that role
along with it has a set of access rights
for various resources and that as I said
you know happens automatically as soon
as we decided what role this new
employee can take an interesting thing
list rule is remember is one of the
design principles that we had we said
you should always execute with the
smallest number of privileges or access
rights that you need to do what is being
done at that time and it's a really
damage containment thing is if something
goes wrong you don't negatively impact
resources that you had no business
having access to at that point so how
does our back help you with that well
actually it does because user can start
in one role and access a subset of the
files that are only available to that
role the user can then switch the roles
and then go access a different set of
roles a different set of files that are
associated with the new role if you
don't have our back in a user has a UID
and has access to everything he or she
can ever access roles sort of give you
this ability to control saying if you
are in a certain role at a given time
only the resources are needed for that
role should be available at that point
and we can do that with our back
you know being able to implement list
releases is a good thing that is a
design principle for systems we want to
trust so our back actually enables that
so are the systems that there are
actually systems that implement our back
SELinux you're going to come back to it
is security enhanced Linux actually
supports our back and there are others
as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
