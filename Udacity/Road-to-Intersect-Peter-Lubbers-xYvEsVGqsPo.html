your lover senior program manager Google
developer training at a company you
might have heard of called Google but
also a Udacity panel speaker at Udacity
intersect coming up on march eight and
also our good friend Peter thanks for
joining us thank you that's great to be
on a ride here yeah I have to imagine
that the first time you've done an
interview in an autonomous vehicle
that's absolutely correct okay awesome
we want to make sure that that's a first
or a pretty amazing uh cool so I you I'm
going to talk a little bit about your
background so you you're at work well
here at Google now you're at a book on
HTML how did you get to where you are
now how did your career involved so
actually didn't start in IT at all when
I moved to the United States in early
90s from netherlands i actually started
out building dear fences building you
know fences or people that wanted to
keep the dr out and i started looking at
other other things to do and sure enough
there was a dutch translation job for
training software basically taught
myself programming i really wish that
there have been a Udacity like program
available at the time at that point it
was mostly just reading out of books and
teaching yourself what do you think are
some of the most exciting areas for
upcoming an emerging developers yeah
yeah well there's so much exciting stuff
going right now it's of course a lot of
things have moved to mobile at Google we
just released the associate Android
developer certification program so
really prove your skills technology-wise
of course also firebase progressive web
apps that's sort of the future and the
hottest thing in when it comes to the
web and also tensorflow some of the
machine learning technologies are coming
out right now that's going so fast and
it's very very exciting I know that
international developer advocacy is a
big passion for you why is that out how
did that become a passion for you and I
know you might be talking about some of
that on market yeah first of course no
we we really put a lot of emphasis on
scalable
training scalable education if you will
coming from Europe originally we're
doing some great scholarship to
initiatives in Europe for training we
have 70,000 people apply for one of
these scholarships and that just blew us
away and then reading some of the
application comments be sort of the
essay questions if you will exist in
heartwarming people that really see this
as sort of like their next step into a
whole other career that this has been
super positive int a sad to hear it so
again you're a panel ski here at Udacity
intersect coming up on market what do
you think it's so important for people
you know out there to come and see you
know people speaking like new but also
getting fun of hiring companies looking
for engineers not like Google yeah yeah
I think what's really important about is
this really the personal connection and
I think what's great for specifically
for Udacity students is they have built
up this amazing portfolio of project but
there's also a lot of focus on for
example your LinkedIn profile and your
resume and all of that and part of that
last mile is really connecting in person
with people it's different it's just a
different thing altogether than let's
say being on a hangout putting it
together I think it's what's the most
powerful hold it in the world right let
me get in person and you need people and
you see the companies in this justice
it's an exciting experience exactly yeah
I'm really looking forward to meeting
all the students and awesome so again
March a Udacity intersect you can hit us
