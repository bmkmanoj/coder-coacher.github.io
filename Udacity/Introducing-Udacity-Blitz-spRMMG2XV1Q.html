the number one thing we wanted to do is
make it as streamlined and easy as
possible for people to propose and get
projects built by our developers if
you're looking to update your webpage
get an app built or maybe you just have
this idea for a side project we know
that oftentimes the projects that you're
having built have a real business impact
so our experience with udacity blitz
really really good in both cases
somebody from Udacity blitz took full
ownership of that project we specified
the requirements and they did the
execution and then having that option to
hire afterwards is fantastic an app
design customer came through our doors
needed to turn around something very
quickly they were able to come run a
design contest within seven days they
had design files and then the Udacity
blitz team took over the coding process
from idea through to design through to
actually having the app liven the App
Store took just three weeks the customer
was ecstatic with knowing our designs
you have best-of-breed designers whereas
with Udacity blitz you have Best of
Breed engineers we have actually hired
somebody through Udacity blitz it's been
great here at Lighthouse I'm working
every day with smart people he's a great
Android developer no matter what we
threw at him he just kept delivering and
to actually get an offer what's amazing
I don't think any of this would be
possible without you tacit ii desolates
come to Udacity blitz you can propose a
project and we can really find a
tailored solution to your problem
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
