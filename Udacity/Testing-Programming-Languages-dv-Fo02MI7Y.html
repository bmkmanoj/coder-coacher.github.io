to gain confidence that it's correct
more formally in a software engineering
class we'd say that we want to gain
confidence that the implementation
adheres to the specification as refined
from the requirements I'm not going to
spend much time on these words in this
class you may have a chance to learn
about them later but the implementation
is your source code and the
specification and requirements come from
the problem statements whatever you were
told to do in the quiz or in the
homework or by your boss or some such
now this is a bit of a personal aside
but in my mind one of the most important
things about testing is noticing that it
only gains you confidence it's not a
proof if you have a big program like a
web browser and you try it on 10 web
pages and it seems good that is not a
proof that it's always going to work
perfectly in the future but it does give
you more confidence than only trying it
on one web page probably depends on how
cool that web pages so typically
programs are very big and accept an
infinite set of inputs there an infinite
number of possible web pages out there
we know that because the grammar for web
pages is recursive and allows for
infinite creativity we could write down
any work of literature and have it be a
web page so we're not going to test them
all in finite time we're only going to
gain confidence by testing a few and
because we can't test everything we have
to pick the things to test well just
like in the previous quiz we don't want
to waste time on test cases that aren't
going to get us at the bug in the real
world and commercial software
engineering testing is a huge cost in
fact maintenance often accounts for
ninety percent of the life cycle cost of
software we spend very little time
writing a program originally and a huge
amount of time maintaining it
refactoring it making it better in the
face of changing ideas with the of what
the users want all that sort of thing so
testing is massive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
