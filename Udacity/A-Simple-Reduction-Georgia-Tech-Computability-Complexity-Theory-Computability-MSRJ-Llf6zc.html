reduction to show that this language be
consisting of the descriptions of Turing
machines that accept something is
undecidable our strategy is to reduce
the diagonal language to it in other
words will argue that deciding B is at
least as hard as deciding the diagonal
language since we can't decide the
diagonal language we can't decide B
either
here's one of many possible productions
the reduction is a computable function
whose input is the description of a
Turing machine M and it's going to build
another machine n in this Python like
syntax first we write down the
description of a Turing machine by
defining this nested function then we
return that function an important point
is that the reduction are never actually
runs the machine in it just writes the
program for it note here that in this
example and totally ignores the actual
input given to it it just runs M on its
own description and does whatever that
computation does hence it is either
going to be a machine that accepts
nothing if M doesn't accept its own
description either by looping or
rejecting or if M does accept its own
description then n is going to accept
everything in the one case the language
of n will be the empty set and in the
other case it will be Sigma star the
decider for this language B would be
able to tell the difference and
therefore tell us whether M accepted its
own description therefore if B had a
decider we would be able to decide the
diagonal language which is impossible so
B cannot be decidable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
