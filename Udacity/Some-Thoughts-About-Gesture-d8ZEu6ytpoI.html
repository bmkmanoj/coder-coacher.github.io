of what's referred to as gesture
recognition it's sort of an old approach
an old problem especially using HMMs but
it's it's a it's a good paradigm there's
a conference called face and gesture in
computer vision so obviously gesture
must be important because there's a
whole conference called face and gesture
and it's a long story going back to
colleagues of mine about why face and
gesture of put together I'll tell you to
you some other time over drinks of some
flavor the typical scenario was you do
some examples of each gesture the system
learns or is trained to have some sort
of model for each and like said lots of
things used hmmm and it runtime one
would compare the output of each of the
different ma you you would evaluate what
you saw in terms of like that of the
sequence and if that uh probability
exceeds a threshold you say aha a
particular gesture happen so this was
done as I said while ago sort of the
mid-90s then it started taper off
because partially this whole idea of
having sort of individual trained
gestures that people would do to make
something happen that didn't feel like
just the recognition of individual
vocabularies so it sort of tapered off
but then all of a sudden new life was
ejected into the field of gesture
recognition and it was because of human
robot interaction okay people really
love the idea of being able to gesture
to a robot which you've ever been to my
lab we sometimes just to the robot in a
not so friendly way but this idea that
you could do things in control a robot
first of all speech is very difficult in
a noisy environment unless you're
wearing a microphone gesture you might
be able to do something more remotely
and it was just this general idea that
was kind of cool to be able to make some
gestures and have a robot respond
appropriately so here I just pulled out
a paper in fact there's Britt Reid 2014
this was at some conference that just
happened and since I'm recording this in
2014 it's uh you know I'm not making
this up this is you know what's
currently going on I'm not advocating
one way the other the importance or
whatever of this particular piece of
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
