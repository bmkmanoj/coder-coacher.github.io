analysis and the challenges associated
with it let's consider one of the common
malware of sketching techniques packing
packing refers to the process of
compressing and in cooking part of an
executable program the result of packing
is that part of the excusable program
now becomes data instead of instruction
set and in order to execute that part of
the program that has been packed in
runtime we must reverse it back from
data to instruction set that is we now
must include in the excusable program
some code that will reverse this packing
process and this is hardly unpacking to
give an illustrative example we have the
original program program a here and you
see that the program contains
instruction sets with a packing tool
that include compression and encryption
and so on the result of packing is that
part of the program meaning part of the
instruction set now becomes data we
observe that the packing result looks
random meaning a data here looks random
this is because it is encrypted with a
randomly generated key each time the
packing program is run on a malware
program that is even for the same
malware program each packed instance
will look different and therefore a
signature based approach is not
effective in detecting the packed
malware now you say this PAC program
will include code that try to unpack the
packed part can we use the Alpha encode
a signature to detect malware the
answer's no the reason is that
legitimate programs may also include
packing in order to hide certain logic
and data for example for copyright
protection that is some legitimate
programs also have African code it will
unpack some part of the program in
runtime therefore we cannot use the
unpacking code a signature to detect
malware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
