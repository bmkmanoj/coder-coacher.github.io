result in a passing test which means
that we again have to increase the
granularity by doubling n in here and
now we split the input into six subsets
resulting in six more attempts to remove
individual parts all of them will pass
and then we have to increase the
granularity again which would be 12 but
now our input only has eight characters
and we can't split an eight character
inputs into 12 subsets unless these
subsets would be empty so we're going to
fix this a bit by setting up this
minimum function over here we make sure
that n cannot grow beyond the size of
the input which means that in our case
and would now be eight and this is the
final stage of Delta debugging where it
tries to remove one character after
another but all of these removals result
in passing test cases so what we get in
the end is this very string select and
we have now shown that every single
character in here is relevant because
removing it changes the outcome of a
test from fail to pass so what Delta
debugging gives us in the end is an
input a simplified input where every
single part is relevant at this point
you may wonder how many tests does Delta
debugging actually take you can see that
at the very end when every single
character has to be removed individually
the number of tests of course is
proportional to the length of the
simplified input in the worst case that
is for very pathological examples the
complexity of Delta debugging is square
with respect to its input however
there's a nice situation in which Delta
debugging simply becomes a binary search
and is as efficient as a binary search
so when does Delta debugging need a
logarithmic number of tests is this when
all tests fail is this when there is
always one half that can be removed and
fails is this when all tests pass or is
this never check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
