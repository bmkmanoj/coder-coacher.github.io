proposition examples and I've selected
something to just give you an idea of
how other startups have approached
articulating their value proposition
here was a company that was actually
trying to developed a bio-based
replacement to the first surfactants and
they actually went out and understood
the problem came up with some solutions
and we're trying to explain the pains
and gains of their value proposition
another example was a robotics
agricultural weeding device now you
notice here they're not talking about
their device at all they're talking
about the problem is hand weeding of
farm fields for organic crops nightmare
another example company that was
actually trying to figure out a better
way to do cancer tests and they actually
try to understand what the problem was
the problem was that cancer cells get
detached and are circulating in the
bloodstream an oncologist and
pathologist are trying to figure out
whether their patients have circulating
cancer tumor cells and their features
match the pain and the game these rest
of the slides give you some examples of
value propositions in medical devices in
dental care etc you could click on the
