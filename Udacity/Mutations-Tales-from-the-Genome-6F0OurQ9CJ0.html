to give you superpowers like the mutant
ninja turtles know that much mutation
that fast is just gonna kill me well
I'll just do it slowly no no no even if
you go slower you won't kill me but I
mean I'm not gonna get psychic powers or
anything like you read about in graphic
novels I mean at best that might be
lactose tolerant or resistant to malaria
and HIV sounds pretty good to me but but
but you can't control where the
mutations happen when you do it I mean
and there's a trade off with malaria it
can cause a Nemean kill you that way
maybe I'll just put those down then yeah
I mean mutations are already happening
all the time anyhow replication errors
UV damage from the Sun and so much more
sounds like dangerous business just
existing oh it is in this lesson we're
going to learn all about how mutation
and variation happened in the first
place and how they spread throughout the
population over many generations nah not
this sounds like a science fiction movie
with mutations spreading through
populations well it kind of is except
we're going to talk about real mutations
knowing what you know about the human
genome the composition of coding and
non-coding regions tell me right now if
you think most mutations would be
advantageous detrimental or neutral</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
