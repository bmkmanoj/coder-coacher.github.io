implementing a parallel algorithm for
blurring images and here's an example of
the effect when you're talking about so
here is your original image and here's
the image after we apply a blur effect
to that origin image so blurring that
image involves averaging local
neighborhood of pixels and is expressed
naturally using a parallel stencil
operation stencil operations come up all
the time
in all types of application domains and
this is why we are going to focusing on
stencil in this homework so let's take a
closer look at a simple example
demonstrating the kind of local
averaging that we are talking about here
so suppose we have the following pixel
representation of the image and we want
to calculate the average intensity value
for this pixel right here so what do we
do first one will take the value of this
pixel and when we add this value to the
value of all its neighbors so 10 4 6 2 1
2 3 and 6 and once we add up all these
values when we take the average and
since we have nine elements or nine
pixels here when we multiply the sum by
one knife and that is how you would
calculate the average intensity value
for a pixel in an image so if we do this
operation for every pixel in the image
we will arrive at a blurred version of
the input image however it turns out
that performing an unweighted average of
pixels can sometimes look really ugly
and we can achieve a better looking blur
by computing a weighted average of these
pixels now what I mean by weighted
average is the following so rather than
multiplying one knife to each pixel
value here when we multiply each pixel
value by a different weight so w1 is
different than W 2 and W 2 may be
different than W 3 and W 3 may be
different than W 4 and that is the
approach that we will take in problem
set number 2 here is a
produced by waited blur and here's an
image produced by unweighted blur and as
you can see that the weighted blur is
much smoother than the unweighted blur
counterpart so in this problem set we
will give you a small 2d array that
contains way values between 0 &amp;amp; 1 as
follows but this is just an example the
actual way values that we will use will
look like this the smooth shape of the
weights as you can see here will produce
the nice-looking blur effect that one
saw earlier and also here is a note when
will blur color images by blurring each
color channel independently and when
will include a more detailed
mathematical formula on blurring
computations in the instructor comments
so this is what you need to do for
problem set number 2 first you will need
to write the actual blur kernel second
you will need to actually write the
kernel that separates the color image to
is RGB channels and third when will give
you the opportunity to allocate memory
on the device for the filter so you will
have an opportunity to comb CUDA many
copies and fourth you will have to set
the correct or the optimal grid and
block size for this problem set and as
you remember in problem set number one
the grid and the block size has a huge
impact on your programs execution time
so set these size correctly and be
careful so lastly your submission will
be evaluated based on correctness and
speed but we recommend that you focus on
correctness first then after your
blurring kernel is running correctly
then we recommend that you try to make
it run faster and lastly we have
supplied serial code that you can
reference and compare your solution
against good luck on writing problem set
number two and if you have any questions
feel free to ask in the class worms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
