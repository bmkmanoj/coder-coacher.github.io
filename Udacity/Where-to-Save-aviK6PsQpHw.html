appdelegate is application did finish
launching with options this happens
immediately after your app launches this
might be a good time to set up your core
data stack but not just save after all
there is nothing new worth saving at
this point next we have application will
resign active this happens when the app
is still in the background but is no
longer active not being active means
user input such as taps don't reach the
app anymore this happens when you're
using it the app and you get a phone
call for example this is a good moment
to save next we have application did
enter background this means your app has
been sent to the background because the
user switch to another app this is also
a good time to save later on we have
application will enter foreground and
application did become active these mean
that your app is back from the
background it wouldn't make much sense
to save in here and last but not least
we have application will terminate your
app is about to be killed by the OS
either the user close the app or iOS
decided to shut it down this sounds like
a good time to save but actually isn't
you don't have much time left at this
point you may want to do a print goodbye
cruel world but anything else is risky
why not saving immediately after
creating a new note in this case it
would be ok as our data model is very
simple however in a more complex app
it's better not to overdo it and save
too often unless you know how to do it
in the background we'll look at how to
do that later so this was all very
informative but we still don't have a
concrete answer if saving every time we
change something it's too much saving
and saving only when the app goes to the
background or becomes an active is too
little what's the best solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
