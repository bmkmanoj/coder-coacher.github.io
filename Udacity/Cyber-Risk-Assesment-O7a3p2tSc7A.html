in place we're going to have people who
are responsible you're going to policy
to inform people about do's and don'ts
and things like that but you know that's
not going to reduce our risk 20 there is
still the possibility because there were
unknown vulnerabilities or people became
victims of a phishing attack we hear
about those sort of on a regular basis
so you know the risk is not going to go
down to zero something could still go
wrong despite having the best planning
and the best management for cyber
security so if there is a risk how do we
sort of get a sense of how much risk is
that we still have what kind of risk are
we dealing with assessing such risk is
important because we talked would cost
benefit so if you're going to make
investment in cybersecurity those
investment decisions I have to be based
on risk and its reduction so you're
going to pay for a certain control how
much is that is being reduced and I said
risk is going to be reduced because it's
now going to be zero the only way to
make it zero is you disconnect from the
rest of the world but then you can't do
anything useful so some risk is going to
remain and if the risk remains well how
do you quantify it if your investments
are going to be based investments asked
of certain control what you're going to
pay for it certainly if there's a number
so if you're assessing risk or
quantifying it how exactly do it will be
great to say you know this is my risk
and this is what i can do to deal with
it how do you assess risk and one of the
things you're going to find out is that
quantifying it is actually not easy the
various frameworks to sort of see what
you do or don't do that may pose some
degree of risk but actually quantifying
it is what is hard so that's what we're
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
