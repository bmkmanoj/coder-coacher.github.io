mutable that makes them unlikely
candidates to put into hash tables and
here's why let's suppose we did allow
lists to be hash table now we're trying
to compute the hash function for Y and
let's say we have a very simple hash
function not a very good one that just
says add up the values of the elements
let's also say that the hash of an
integer is itself so the hash code for
this list would be equal to sixth and
the sum of the elements but now the
problem is because these lists are
mutable I could go in and I could say
why at 0 equals 10 why would be the list
10 23 and now when we check and say is
why in d we're going to compute the hash
value 10 plus two plus three equals 15
and that's a different hash value than
we had before so if we stored y into the
dictionary when it had the value 6 and
now we're trying to fetch it when it has
the value 15 you can see how Python is
going to be confused now there's two
ways you could handle that one the way
that Python does take is to disallow
putting the list into the hash table in
the first place because it potentially
could lead to errors if it was modified
the other way is the Python could allow
you to put it in but then recognize that
it's the programmers fault and if you go
ahead and modify it the things are not
going to work anymore and Python does
not take that approach although some
other languages do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
