making sure elements appear in the Dom
in a way that makes sense for the tab
order well what do you do when you have
content which isn't on screen yet but it
still needs to be in the Dom a good
example of this is a responsive drawer
panel now this is a really common UI
pattern and it can present an
interesting challenge for accessibility
to illustrate this here is the desktop
version of that same site and I want you
to notice what happens as I press the
tab key focus will start off up here in
the corner it'll then move to this input
this button and then it's just gonna
disappear now I'm still pressing the tab
key in fact I press it a few times now
but we're not seeing anything mm-hmm
oh wait our focus just appeared right
down here so what happened there why did
it disappear
well you might see where I'm going with
this that whole time that focus was
off-screen it was actually hiding inside
of this drawer panel going through and
focusing all of these individual links
well this isn't really a great situation
to be in and when you're building an
application you might occasionally find
that as you're tabbing around focus
seems to suddenly just disappear to
figure out what's going on you may need
to do a bit of detective work if you're
chiming around and you notice focus
suddenly disappears you can go into your
console and log the document active
element so I'll do that right now
I'll start by focusing my hamburger menu
again I'll move through to the input
button and once focus disappears I'll go
down to my console and log document
active element active element gives you
a reference to the currently focused
item which in this case looks like some
kind of fancy button so we can go and
look for our fancy button here in our
source code and make sure that it's not
focusable but another option to do our
detective work is to use the chrome
accessibility dev tools extension the
dev tools extension adds a number of
useful features including an inspector
which will show you the accessibility
properties of an element as well as a
set of accessibility audits you can find
these by opening the dev tools and going
to the audits section
located right here here I've unchecked
everything except for the accessibility
audit itself and I'm going to run it
against the present state of my page
when I do this you'll see that it
produces a number of errors including
items that are focusable
but either invisible or obscured by
another element and looking at that list
we can see our fancy button and all of
the other anchor tags inside of that
off-screen menu to fix the drawer menu
one option would be to set it to either
display:none or visibility hidden using
CSS whenever it's off-screen this will
prevent focus from being able to move
into that element and focusing any of
the child links inside of it and then
when the element comes back on-screen or
just before it's about to animate on
screen we can set it back to display
block or set the visibility back to
visible now in the next section we'll
have you do some sleuthing of your own
using these tools to find some
off-screen content and then to fix it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
