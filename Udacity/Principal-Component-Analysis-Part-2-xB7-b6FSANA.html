right you is some vector which vector
you not me you a matrix times a vector X
in severy thing is linear if I describe
you as being made up of a bunch of
components that add up to you it's the
same thing as Sigma times those bunch of
those components so in particular the
components could be the eigenvectors of
Sigma so I can express you the
eigenvectors of Sigma point whatever
direction they point I can think of you
as being made up of a sum of those all
right so U is a unit vector okay it can
be expressed in terminus what says does
linear sum of those eigen vectors of
Sigma the question is which of those
directions would return me the largest
value okay well we know that Sigma times
of eigenvector is equal to lambda eigen
vector if I'm going to pick a single
direction that will return the largest
vector back and then I'm going to take
the the dot product itself to get the
magnitude I would need the eigenvector
with the largest eigen value and at the
heart of it that's actually why the
eigenvector with the largest eigen value
is the direction along which you get the
greatest variance so you can either
spend a little time thinking about that
and understand why that's true or you
can believe me I guess I could have
written it out more but I think most of
you at this point know that I take the
the eigenvector the largest eigen value
of the covariance matrix that's the
direction of the greatest variation so
that's what this says here that the
direction that captures the maximum
covariance of the data is the eigen
vector corresponding to the largest
eigen value of the data covariance
matrix Kutta
that's what we're doing so furthermore
that's the longest one I can take the
top I don't know K of them orthogonal
direct and they're all they're all
orthogonal to each other and that will
capture the most variation that I can of
K orthogonal vectors so I could say well
I've got this 10,000 dimensional thing
maybe I'll take the top 10
20 30 40 that captures them as much
variation as I can with 10 20 30 40
orthogonal vectors so that's what I I
want to use but in order to do that in
order to do PCA and images on images I
have to teach you a trick and this is
the PCA for D much much much much bigger
than M RN trick all right and so let's
do the trick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
