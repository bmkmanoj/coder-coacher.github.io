internet by measuring our latency to
different destinations and in fact we
can also see the hops along the way so I
showed you on the map of Greece the hops
along the way we can see the same thing
for destinations of Internet and we can
do that using an application called
traceroute if you're using a Mac you can
just create a shell and run traceroute
directly if you're using some other
operating system you might need to do
something a little different and we'll
have directions for that on the site but
you can do trace road and after a trace
route you pick where you want the
destination to be so first we'll try
tracing the route to udacity.com and
what traceroute is doing is sending
packets over the internet looking at all
the intermediate hops to figure out the
route it takes to get a packet from
where I am now to the Udacity comm site
and when we run that we see the route
you can see each hop so from where I am
now to reach Udacity common steps the
total time was about 39 milliseconds so
you can see there are several different
times it's doing multiple tests and the
time might vary each test but the time
is about 39 milliseconds and you can
also see the steps the first thing you
see is that our sites actually being
served on a server run by Google so
that's what the Udacity calm site
resolves to and you can see all the hops
along the way the 192 dot 168 dot one
dot one that's a special Internet
address that means your local machine
you always start there and then you can
see all the other pops that we go
through and the time it took to get
there and so there are different hops
that took different amounts of time you
can see the time does vary so we can see
that the time to get to the Comcast site
here in Santa Clara varied from 11 to 37
milliseconds and you can see all the
other hops along the way that each hop
took a millisecond or two between that
hop to get 15 hops took us about 40
milliseconds so if we try to go
somewhere further away let's try tracing
the route to MIT ID to you
well that's servers running from Boston
so I'm here in California to get to
Udacity to come to go very far
geographically to get to MIT we've got
to go across the country so now we're
going to Boston so we started where we
are now
we went through santa clara we went
through san jose sometimes from the host
names you can guess where they are
sometimes you can but here it's pretty
clear we're going from san jose and then
we're going across the country to new
york and you can see that the big time
difference was when we went from San
Jose to New York
there's no hops so unlike the Greeks
where the distance between hops was very
limited in the internet the distance
between hops can be thousands of miles
there's some fiber optic cable probably
between those two points and there's no
need for any routing directions once you
got to this point in San Jose you end up
in New York without going through any
other decision points and then we get to
Boston and it takes about a hundred
milliseconds before we get to MIT and
you can see we're not actually getting
the final destination we're getting some
stars we're not getting a response from
the webserver at MIT we could do that if
we tried a few more trace routes and set
the timeouts differently but to get
across the country it took about a
hundred milliseconds and we can go
somewhere further away about the
farthest away you can get from where I
am now is Madagascar so I'm going to try
tracing around to a server in Madagascar
if there are any students in Madagascar
please contact me and we try that trace
route and we can see that it starts
again going through San Jose goes
through Dallas now it's going through a
lot of servers run by the same country
and that's getting across the ocean
getting towards Madagascar and you can
see it's starting to take quite a long
time so it took a hundred milliseconds
to get to MIT here we have taking 195
milliseconds already and we haven't yet
reached Madagascar the time it takes to
do the traceroute is much longer than
the time it takes to get a request from
these pages because it's sending many
requests trying to find all the points
along the way but this is a good way you
can see what's going on in the internet
and get a better understanding of how
packets are getting from where you are
to where you're making a request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
