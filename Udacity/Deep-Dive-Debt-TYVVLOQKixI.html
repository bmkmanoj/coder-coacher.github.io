your business is the right option for
you well first define debt financing
then hear about the benefits and
downsides of choosing this option so
first what is it
debt financing is basically any form of
loan you could get to help start your
business
banks lenders or any other source of
income that you need to pay back is all
a form of debt when using debt financing
as an option the main thing to consider
is that you'll be paying back the loans
you get over an extended period of time
each payment will include a principal
plus interest the principal payment is
the amount that will go towards paying
the original loan amount the interest
charge will vary depending on the loan
but this is the amount you owe on top of
the principal payment as a fee for
borrowing money from your lender there
are a few benefits and downsides to be
aware of before considering debt
financing for your business so first
what are some of the benefits
let's overview three of them ownership
taxes and interest rates first ownership
when borrow money from a bank or any
other lender for your business you have
the same agreement as with any other
loan you're agreeing to make your
payments on time and that's it from
there you can make whatever decisions
you want about your business and the
lender stays out of the way this lets
you get the money you need while
maintaining full ownership of your
business
next taxes when you get a loan for your
business the payments you make are
considered tax-deductible business
expenses tax laws vary widely based on
where you live and may also be impacted
by where you choose to incorporate your
business this is a great way to minimize
the cost of any loan you accept just be
sure to diligently track your expenses
or get an accountant to make sure you're
getting the returns you should be and
finally you can get lower interest rates
for your business loans look through any
options you may have and choose the one
that's best for your business this is a
big decision this can get pretty
complicated so I suggest you consult
with an accountant before making any
major decisions like this for your
startup while there are some benefits to
debt financing it's important to
understand some of the potential
downsides to choosing this option let's
overview three major downsides repayment
unaffordable rates and credit rating
first repayment when you take a loan you
don't have to give up any control
but you will need to continue making
payments possibly for a very long time
if your business doesn't work out and
you aren't making profits to help make
these payments your lender still wants
their money next unaffordable rates
after considering your tax deductions
and discounts you might still be getting
a pretty high interest rate from your
lender it's tough enough to run a
business without having to worry about
making an extra 20% interest on top of
your other expenses and finally be
careful about your credit rating if you
choose to take out a personal loan it
may affect your credit score having
extra marks on your credit score makes
you a bigger risk to your lender and
you'll end up paying for that and even
higher interest rates one option to
overcome this downside is to obtain a
business loan it is more difficult due
to logistical issues but the advantage
is that it won't affect your personal
credit score while debt financing is
possible it's a really tough way to go
and can be pretty devastating if things
don't go according to plan it's best to
validate the success of your product by
seeking investment or by operating a
business with personal expenses you can
afford to lose if you decide that
financing is right for you be very
careful about how you plan your business
and do plenty of research</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
