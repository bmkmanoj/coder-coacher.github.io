last video so here's just a summary of
all of that on one screen we can think
about grants sales stories so far as
having two situations the situation
after the first day which I'm going to
call the before picture and the
situation after the second day of
selling which is the present situation
we're concerned with the last equation
that we came up with a equals 36 w plus
22 n had to do with just the sales from
the first day so I changed the name of
the total money earned to a old to show
that this is the money earned after the
first day of selling this equation still
works if we're only interested in
calculating the money that Grant earned
from his friends after just that one day
but now we want to find is what I'm
going to call a new the money he's going
to get from those people and from these
new people who also want to buy what
we're going to do in this quiz is come
up with an equation for a new which
should combine the information from a
old with this new data about people who
are also going to buy at the wipers and
nozzles so which of these equations down
at the bottom is the correct equation
for a new the total amount of money that
grant will have after these people on
the first day buy his wipers and nozzles
and these people from the second day buy
his wipers and nozzles this is a lot of
information to take in so I'm going to
label this quiz a challenge quiz
actually many of the quizzes that you've
had have been challenging but I think
the business is especially difficult
think really carefully about how many
terms you think this new equation should
have should have two terms or should it
have four terms also there may be more
than one correct answer even if you
don't get it right the first time just
give it another shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
