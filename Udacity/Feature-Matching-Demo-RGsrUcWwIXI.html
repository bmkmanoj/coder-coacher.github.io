matching demo to kind of demonstrate how
we can do this kind of feature detection
to show you this demo let's go to the
sandbox again remember it always going
to have the last code that you played
around with and here I'm basically
putting in the code to help us do
feature detection again setting up numpy
and cv2 and all of that stuff some code
to draw things look for things in there
and read an image now one thing I want
to point out we are using a special
variant on sift called orb that's what
we're going to be using you should be
able to in your own set of space if you
have all configured correctly with
opencv in python be able to actually use
a sift also i encourage you to look at
the documentation of sift on opencv to
try that out so basically again in this
process we come up with the whole
process to find the key points we draw
them these are shown here and then we
actually run a matching algorithm to be
able to match these types of things and
once these matches are appearing we will
print them out and then of course show
the matches so let's run okay it's
pointing out the image sizes it found
five hundred key points in the two
images and found 257 matches these are
the two images this one and this one so
this is the you know the box cover
itself directly in this box again here
with the cluj ins and all are shown
there and of course now if you notice
that it actually did a lot of
computation to find all of those
features on both of these images and
lots of colors here and once it found
those features it matched them so now I
was able to put this here and if you
notice all of the visible parts that
were there here were matched between the
image here and this one image here so
this showcases how this can be done and
just showcase the whole code is right
above here and we'll even share with you
this code so you can actually play
around with it yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
