expression plus this is really handy
when we want to match one or more of
something this is a very concise way of
listing actually an infinite number of
possibilities if I write the regular
expression a followed by a plus it
matches a AAA AAA AAA the plus looks
back to the previous regular expression
and changes the meaning so that instead
of just matching that once you match it
once or more as many times as you'd like
here I've shown another example we're
looking for 0 through 1 repeated one or
more times and the interpretation here
is every time you repeat you can make a
different choice so this matches 0 1 1 0
0 &amp;amp; 1 1 but also 0 1 and this required
us to pick a 0 the first time and a 1
the second time that's totally fine with
the plus 1010 is a favorite year of mine
it's about when motuhake Shikibu wrote
The Tale of Genji she's often credited
with writing the first novel the first
psychological novel although this is the
subject of some dispute there is a minor
bit of ambiguity I need to clear up with
this plus let's say that we're looking
for numbers 0 through 9 plus in the
string 13 from 1 in 1776 one possible
answer is 13 1 + 1 7 7 6
but this plus just means one or more is
there anything that says that I have to
match them all at the same time or could
I break up 1776 into 4 different 1
letter strings it turns out that there's
a rule in regular expressions called
maximal munch which says that a regular
expression should consume or eat or
match the biggest string it can and not
smaller parts so we and Python and other
people studying regular expressions are
going to get this answer 13 1 1776
because 1 7 7 6 is the maximal munch we
can get here for 0 through 9 Plus don't
stop early go all the way alright so
let's get a little more practice with
compound regular expression matching
including the plus down here I've
written a regular expression dot find
all expression in Python and a bunch of
possible answers I'd like you to check
the ones that could be elements of the
return value of this Python expression
we're looking for zero through nine
followed by Oh what does this mean I
haven't showed this to you yet
we just have open brackets a space in a
closed bracket that means just match
space and then finally 0 through 9 plus
remember the plus only applies to this
last 0 through 9 and then we're looking
for all of these in that torture string
I made up earlier let's try it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
