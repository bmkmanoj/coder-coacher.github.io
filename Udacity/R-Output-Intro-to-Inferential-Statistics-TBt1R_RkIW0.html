the one that we get when we do a
hypothesis test for the plane flight
distance versus cost that we talked
about earlier when we do linear
regression in our the statistical
program that I've briefly mentioned
before this is the output usually you'll
do software to do any type of hypothesis
test whether it's on a sample mean or to
sample means or the correlation
coefficient or the slope or whatever the
important thing is that you understand
the meaning of the software output here
you see the T value for the slope is
pretty big 5.77 the same value I gave
you earlier and the p value is pretty
small there are three stars by it
indicating that the p value is small
enough to reject the null
here are the significance codes which
lists the Alpha levels we see that three
stars means we can reject the null at
the significance level of 0.01 since the
slope is significant we know there's a
true relationship between the distance
traveled and the cost of the plane
ticket note that we can also conduct a
hypothesis test on the y intercept and
in this case we see that it's not
significant the p-value is pretty high
at point two and there are no stars by
it this means that we're not totally
sure that the true intercept is at 161
0.38 775 however in many cases the
estimate for the intercept is not of
interest to researchers one reason is
that this value could have no meaning in
real life because x equals zero may not
be realistic for example the price of
iPods at the Year Zero ad iPods weren't
even invented back then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
