relationship between friends initiated
and aged for the ggplot syntax we're
just gonna pass it X which will be age
and why would you be friends initiated
will put those in the aesthetic wrapper
and then pass PF as our data frame I
also need to remember to specify the
giome so here I'll use G on point for a
scatterplot this should get me going it
looks like that I use the wrong variable
here so looking at my data I can see
that friendships initiated should be my
variable rather than friends initiated
running this code we can see our
scatterplot now I still get this
discreteness with age so I'm gonna
jitter our points here I'll use an alpha
set to 1/10 so I need 10 points to make
just one of these that's looking a
little bit better
another way to jitter to the points is
to still use giome point but then to set
the position equal to jitter this code
will produce the same plot that we have
here let's run it to be sure sure enough
we have the same plot and since I still
have really high values for some of my
friendships initiated I'm going to use a
chord transformation and take the square
root of the y-axis when I add the chord
trans layer and run this code I see that
I get an error message this should make
sense since some of my friendships
initiated have a count of 0 so when I
take the square root of that number with
some noise it might be negative which
would be an imaginary result so I'm
going to fix this code like we had
before so that way we have the position
set equal to H equals 0 so we'll set
position equal to position jitter and
we'll pass it H equals 0 this is the
plot that I came up with now you might
have had something slightly different or
you might have even used a different
transformation whatever you found and
whatever your observations may be share
them in the discussions we'd love to
hear from you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
