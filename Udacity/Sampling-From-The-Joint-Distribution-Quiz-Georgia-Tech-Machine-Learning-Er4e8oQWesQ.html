on this kind of representation let's
let's look at some things we can do with
it
so here's an example of a Bayesian
network with five variables
ABCDE and let's pretend that each one
has some some set of possible values
could be true/false it could be red
green blue whatever it happens to be and
these arrows again tell us about our
conditional dependence relationships so
how would we go about actually well say
sampling from this distribution so let's
say that we wanted to just as an example
see what ABCD and E might look like in a
randomly selected example from the
distribution that this network
represents so it turns out what we can
do is we if we sample from a now a is
specified has no incoming arrow so it's
not conditioned on anything in
particular so we can sample directly
from a's distribution we can do the same
for b and now see if we want a sample
from c we need to make use of what
values have already been selected for a
and B because C is conditioned on a and
B but we can sample from that
distribution each each value of a and B
joint value of a and B gives a
distribution over C and we'd do the same
thing for D and the same thing for E and
we're done what we've sampled from is
actually the probability distribution
the joint probability distribution so
that does that seem like a useful thing
to be able to do Charles it does seem
like a useful thing to be able to do
yeah so here's it just a quickie quiz so
just write a one-word description that
says well in this sampling you notice I
went ABCD and E what ordering do I need
to do if I have a belief net like this
specified by this graphical structure
with the arrows if I want to be able to
sample it I need to do it in a
particular order some orders are going
to be problematic because we haven't
actually you know sampled the variables
that it depends on so what ordering
should we select for ABCDE
in general what's what what is the the
name for that so that we can actually do
this kind of sampling trick this way
