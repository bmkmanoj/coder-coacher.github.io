is an infinite number of solutions to
this inequality we need a way to write
those answers and I don't to list them
out because that could be tedious so
let's use a solution set a solution set
is all the answers to this inequality to
find them we solve this inequality just
like we solve an equation we subtract
two from both sides to get 3x is greater
than six then we divide both sides by
the coefficient in front of the variable
we divide by three and the answer is x
is greater than two so any number larger
than two will make the center quality
true let's use a solution set to write
our answer we can show the solution in
two ways we can use a number line or
interval notation we use an open
parenthesis at x equals 2 because X can
actually equal to it's got to be bigger
than 2 and then we draw an arrow in the
direction of the numbers that are all
bigger than 22 is considered to be the
lower bound of our solution set we use
an open parenthesis for two so that we
don't include it we can remember because
if we plug in to here we'll get 8
greater than 8 which isn't true so we
don't include two in the solution we use
an open parenthesis for positive
infinity because we can't actually reach
infinity any number bigger than two will
work you might be used to seeing an open
circle at two which is correct for this
class though we'll only use the
parentheses when showing answers on the
number line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
