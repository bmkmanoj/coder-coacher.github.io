is an infinite number of solutions to
this inequality we know a way to write
those answers and I don't wanna list
them out because that could be tedious
so let's use a solution set a solution
set is all the answers to this
inequality to find them we solve this
inequality just like we solve an
equation we subtract 2 from both sides
to get 3x is greater than 6 then we
divide both sides by the coefficient in
front of the variable we divide by 3 and
the answer is X is greater than 2 so any
number larger than 2 will make this
inequality true let's use a solution set
to write our answer we can show the
solution in two ways we can use a number
line or interval notation we use an open
parenthesis at x equals 2 because X
can't actually equal 2 it's got to be
bigger than 2 and then we draw an arrow
in the direction of the numbers that are
all bigger than 2 2 is considered to be
the lower bound of our solution set we
use an open parenthesis for 2 so that we
don't include it we can remember because
if we plug in 2 here we'll get 8 greater
than 8 which isn't true so we don't
include 2 in the solution we use an open
parenthesis for positive infinity
because we can't actually reach infinity
any number bigger than 2 will work you
might be used to seeing an open circle
at 2 which is correct for this class
though will only use the parenthesis
when showing answers on the number line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
