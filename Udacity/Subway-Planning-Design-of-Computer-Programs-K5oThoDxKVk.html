routes on a subway system this is a map
of the subway system for my hometown of
Boston and we're going to have a
representation of this map and then
we're going to be able to ask questions
of what's the shortest path to get from
A to B now I'm going to show you what I
decided as the format for how I
represent the subway line and the
functions I want you to write so I'm
going to rent represented as we call
this function subway which builds up a
data structure and the signs that we're
going to assign to the variable Boston
and the arguments to this function are a
bunch of keyword arguments blue is the
list of stations separated by spaces
just regular words separated by spaces
and the orange line green line red line
similar now here's the signature for
this function subway it takes this
double asterisk parameter name notation
if you haven't seen that before what
that means is that these are the keyword
arguments so two asterisks means
everything that's left is going to be a
keyword argument I'm not going to tell
you what they are they can be anything
and collect them into this parameter
called lines and make that be a
dictionary a dictionary where in this
case the keys of the dictionary would be
the strings blue orange green and red
and the values of the dictionary would
be these corresponding strings so that's
what lines is then you do whatever you
want two lines and return the result if
you want you could just return the lines
of dictionary as is that would be fine
but if you did that you probably need to
do more complicated processing on the
values later on so you might want to do
some of the processing upfront and
return some other type of data structure
for subway because you're going to need
it down here so down here we're going to
write the ride function that says how do
we get from here to there so here and
there are going to be stops for example
how do we get from Oak Grove to downtown
station or stop those are just strings
which represents the stops the system
which in this case
is defaults to Boston the subway system
that we are previously defined and you
write your code there and presumably
you're going to have some sort of call
to a search function you're going to
need to define a successor function
that'll be appropriate and so you need
to decide what's the representation
you'll come up with for Subway that will
be useful to the successor function that
you're going to use here and then just
for fun let's also write the function
longest ride which takes as input a
subway system such as Boston and tells
you what's the longest ride you can get
from from all the pairs of stations
going from one to the other what's the
longest one and I helped you out a
little bit here by writing just a small
number of test cases and you can try
that out you can also write more test
cases up on your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
