because i have given you one example
where greedy works extremely well
doesn't mean that this algorithm will
perform well on any network we haven't
yet proven that it has a good
approximation quality and a good way to
test approximation quality is to always
try and construct an input for which the
algorithm will perform really really bad
so basically we're now going to try and
trick this algorithm here the greedy
algorithm into picking sub-optimal
vertices basically using this greedy
strategy against it and if we do this
basically using this greedy strategy
against it and that will give us some
indication on where this algorithm could
fail and how badly it could fail so if
it's a factor two approximation
algorithm if it's a factor 1.5
approximation algorithm may be or if
it's actually not a good approximation
algorithm at all although it sounds good
and of course this is similar to some of
the problems we have already had in this
course finding out how to trick this
algorithm that takes a bit of playing
around so next to the screen here I of
lying about four or five sheets of paper
on which I experimented around to find
out how I could trick this algorithm and
whenever you want to take an
approximation algorithm it just takes a
bit of time to sink your teeth into that
but here's something that I have come up
with and it's very similar of course to
to the ideas that other people have also
had to try and trick the greedy
algorithm so I'll start out with the
amazing number of 24 vertices now as if
this weren't enough I will now add 12
additional vertices you can now see why
you step so much paper playing around
with this and I'm going to connect them
like this now my question to you is how
many vertices would greedy choose if we
go with this graph here as an input and
please enter your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
