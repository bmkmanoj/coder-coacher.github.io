always start by identifying our unknown
in this case it was the angle we don't
know the angle so we call it X next we
want to identify an equation in words
the supplement of an angle is 40 more
than twice its complement these words
actually represent our equation we have
the supplement on the left and 40 more
than twice the compliment on the right
this word is often serves as the word
equals this allows us to set the
supplement equal to 40 more than twice
the complement the supplement of our
unknown angle would be 180 minus X and
the complement of our unknown angle
would be 90 minus X now we solve this
equation like before we distribute the
positive 2 to get 180 minus 2x then we
combine like terms to get 220 next we
add 2x to both sides and we get 180 plus
x equals 220 I've rewritten the
statement over here and my last step I
just subtract 180 from both sides so X
is 40 degrees if you got that one right
great work you really come a long way
and understanding equations and
expressions this stuff is pretty tough
the last thing we want to do is make
sure our answer is correct the
supplement of 40 degrees is 140 degrees
since these two add up to 180 and the
complement of our angle is 50 degrees so
let's compare these results with what we
started with is this compliment 40 more
than twice our supplement if I double
the compliment I get a hundred degrees
and if I add 40 to it I get 140 degrees
so yeah that's my supplement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
