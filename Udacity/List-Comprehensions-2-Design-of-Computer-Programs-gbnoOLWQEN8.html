more complicated than a list with
strings as entries here we have a list
where each entry is a tuple as indicated
by these parentheses and for now let's
just think of tuples as unchangeable or
immutable lists and each of these tuples
contains a name a TA name the country
where that ta lives and in the course
which that ta is currently instructing
this data is interesting but I'd rather
have it presented to me as a list of
sentences and we can do that with list
comprehensions so here we've turned ta
data into a list of strings and each of
those strings is a sentence about a TA
for example Peter lives in USA and is
the TA for CS 262 now how do we do that
we use the same sort of list
comprehension we use last time but now
ta data isn't iterable and its entries
are tuples these two poles each have
three entries and when we reference
these names here here and here Python
understands what we're talking about now
let's have a quiz using the same
structure for ta data that we had before
I want to construct sentences but only
about the country in which each ta lives
for example Peter lives in USA or goon
daga lives in Latvia I've given you
three options for possible list
comprehensions that may accomplish this
task that given ta data will produce the
correct ta country and so which of the
following list comprehensions will work
check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
