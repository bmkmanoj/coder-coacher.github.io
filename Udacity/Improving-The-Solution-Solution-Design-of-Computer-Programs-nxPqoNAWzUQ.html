won't work because the frontier might be
infinite in this particular problem
there's only a finite number of states
but in some problems there might be an
infinite number and so if we kept on
generating new elements onto the
frontier we may never get to the end
doing one step won't do it either in
this case if once we found the solution
from this 14 if we then gave all the
other guys one step it would work in
this case but it might be that took two
steps maybe there would be from the 15
there be one step that cost one and
another step that cost two so it might
not just be one step so that's not going
to work the test later part will work
and the reason it works is because now
we've guaranteed that everybody on the
frontier is sorted and we're pulling off
the shortest one first so if we put it
back on to the frontier rather than
recognizing immediately that it's a goal
then since we're pulling them off in
order of increasing cost then we know
that the first one we pull off the
frontier that is a goal that must be the
cheapest path to the goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
