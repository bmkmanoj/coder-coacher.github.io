place so the fundamental reason is that
the resolvers that issue the DNS query
trust the responses that are received
after they send out a query regardless
of where that response comes from so
sometimes these responses can be forged
when a resolver sends a query it
typically generates what's called a race
condition and if the attacker replies
before the legitimate responder then the
resolver is likely to believe the
attacker DLS responses can also contain
additional dns information that's
unrelated to the query the fundamental
problem is that the basic DNS protocols
have no means for authenticating
responses this allows an attacker to
forge responses after a resolver sends a
query a secondary reason that these
types of spoofed replies are possible is
that DNS queries are typically
connectionless unlike BGP we're routing
messages are transmitted over a reliable
TCP connection UDP queries are sent over
a connectionless UDP connection
therefore a resolver does not have a way
of mapping the response that it receives
for a query other than the query ID
which can be forged by the attacker
let's look at how the combination of the
lack of authentication and the
connectionless nature of a DNS query
allows the possibility for cache
poisoning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
