camera calibration there are two
different types of camera calibration
first is the geometric calibration where
we basically are interested when we look
at a 3d scene is how each and every
pixel in the real world is relating to
directions angles shapes you know any
kind of geometric information in the
real world so that requires us to now
calibrate the camera and the location of
the camera with respect to the scenes
and objects in a scene so we can
actually get more 3d information that's
geometric of course we're also
interested remember from our earlier
lectures to be able to capture
radiometric photometric information from
a scene you know like reflectances and
scattering of light information here
basically were interested in each and
every pixel relate to the radiance
mounts in the real world you know what's
happening in a scene what's the exact
radiance value at any point in a scene
how can we capture it onto a pixel in an
image again this is the whole pipeline
we just saw where we basically want to
be able to go from L all the way to AI
now we studied this a little bit when we
did panoramas sometimes we might not
have the ability to capture everything
in a 3d world directly from the sensors
so what we want to do now is take a
little bit of a data-driven approach and
basically that suggests is let's
actually do this by looking at a bunch
of images not just one image and use
that information as to how things change
when I take a bunch of different images
so for example here I may have a color
pattern which tells me everything else
about it but I could take a color
pattern a checkered pattern and move it
around and as I move it around if
knowing a little bit more about the
information in that scene in this case
of course the exact nature of the
structured pattern associated here and
if I look at it from the same camera I
should be able to kind of now get
different data at different points that
basically suggests is that now I can get
how pixel relates to the geometry in a
scene by just looking at a whole lot of
other images well the same thing is true
in the case of photometric this was
relevant when we looked at the whole
case of panoramas this is more relevant
in the kind of world of HDR where
basically now we are trying to relate is
how the radiance at any point on the
scene
accounting for a specific pixel
intensity and we do this by calibrating
a camera by getting a lot of data by the
same scene by having different images
remember again these were both issues
that help us when we start thinking
about concepts like epsilon photography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
