things that our basic machine model
needs to have one is a memory the second
one is some sort of input output
capabilities and finally we need to have
certain programming capabilities there's
lots of different models that have these
capabilities but in this course we're
going to use a model called the RAM and
Ram stands for random access machine so
there are many different ways of
defining a random access machine and
we'll use a model similar to the one
defined by Steven Skeena in this book
the algorithm design manual so the first
thing that the RAM has is a memory and
that memory can of course be used for
input for output and for holding the
program that the RAM is running on but
as a simplification we're going to split
the memory into three parts so we're
just going to use this memory here for
intermediate results and output and
we're going to have a separate memory
for the input and a separate memory to
hold the program and those two memories
here on the left side are read-only
meaning that the RAM cannot modify the
input it could only read the input and
the RAM can also not modify the program
it could only read the program and
usually when we will talk about the
memory requirements of an algorithm what
we will be talking about is how much of
this memory here the RAM is using
generally there is no limit of how much
of this memory here we have so we always
have as much as we want but the memory
is divided into single cells and each of
these cells has a limited capacity so
each of these cells cannot have
arbitrarily large values but there's as
many cells as the algorithm needs now if
we are running a program on the RAM what
we're mainly interested in is the time
that this program is going to run for a
given input and they're basically three
rules for how long the RAM requires to
execute a program simple operations such
as adding two numbers multiplying them
or executing an if or a for those all
take one time step if you have a loop in
your program such as a for loop this
will count not as a simple operation but
count as often as it runs so if you have
a loop that
execute a simple operation 100 times
that will count as 100 time steps and
finally you also get something for free
accessing memory so reading a part of
the input or writing something into a
memory cell here that is free that means
that actually takes zero time steps and
these three rules give us a simple way
of determining the running time of an
algorithm or program or also of
comparing the running time of two
programs because all we need to do is
count the number of time steps that we
expect the RAM to execute for a given
input so let's practice this for a
little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
