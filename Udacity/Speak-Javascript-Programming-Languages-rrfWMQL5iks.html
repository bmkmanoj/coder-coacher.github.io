this course will we be able to write
JavaScript programs this question sounds
simple but actually and surprisingly
complicated yes by the end of this
course you will have written a few
simple but honest JavaScript programs
like the implementation of Euclid's
algorithm that you've already done over
the course of the next few units you'll
get one or two more chances to write
JavaScript simple JavaScript programs
but mostly we'll be doing that to make
sure that we understand the
correspondence between JavaScript and
Python one of the things that will hint
at as this course progresses is that
those two languages are actually
equivalent in a very strong theoretical
sense anything you could do in Python we
could also do in javascript and vice
versa now when people say are you
familiar with JavaScript have you
written a long JavaScript program
they're probably talking about the way
JavaScript interacts with a web page
uses the document object model to draw
flashy animations or change what's
displayed to the user we're not going to
cover that in this class that's more of
a presentation or user interface issue
in this class we want to understand the
theory the nuts and bolts behind various
programming languages so we're not going
to talk a lot about how to draw buttons
or how to make special text effects
instead we're going to talk about how to
interpret functions and integers and
strings what if the users Java program
is recursive could we still handle that
and once you can handle a language that
has variables and recursion and rich
control flow and a plethora of meanings
it turns out that all computer science
formal languages that have that sort of
power drawl equivalent anything you
could do and see you could do in C++ or
Java or JavaScript or Python so you
could work your way up to writing the
flashy buttons but it's not a topic for
this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
