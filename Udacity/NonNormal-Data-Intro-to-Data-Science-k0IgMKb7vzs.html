that our data is normal in the wild
you'll often encounter probability
distributions that are distinctly non
normal they might look like this or like
this or completely different as you'd
imagine there are still statistical
tests that we can utilize when our data
is non normal
why don't we briefly discuss what you
might do in situations like this first
off we should have some machinery in
place for determining whether or not our
data is Gaussian in the first place a
crude inaccurate way of determining
whether or not our data is normal is
simply to plot a histogram of our data
and ask does this look like a bell curve
in both of these cases the answer would
definitely be no but we can do a little
bit better than that there are some
statistical tests that we can use to
measure the likelihood that a sample is
drawn from a normally distributed
population one such test is the Shapiro
Wilk test I don't want to go into great
depth with regards to the theory behind
this test but I do want to let you know
that it's implemented in scifi you can
call it really easily like this w and p
are going to be equal to scifi stats to
p row data where our data here is just
an array or list containing all of our
data points this function is going to
return these two values the first W is
the Shapiro Wilk test statistic the
second value in this tuple is going to
be our p value which should be
interpreted in the same way that we
would interpret the p-value for our
t-test that is given the null hypothesis
that this data is drawn from a normal
distribution what is the likelihood that
we would observe a value of W that was
at least as Extreme as the one that we
see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
