I ask you to make your inputs 0 mean and
equal variance earlier it's very
important for SGD I also told you to
initialize with random weights that have
relatively small variance same thing I'm
going to talk about a few more of those
important tricks and that should cover
all you really need to worry about to
implement as DeeDee the first one is
momentum remember that at each step
we're taking a very small step in a
random direction but that on aggregate
those steps take us towards the minimum
of the loss we can take advantage of the
knowledge that we've accumulated from
previous steps about where we should be
headed a cheap way to do that is to keep
a running average of the gradients and
to use that running average instead of
the direction of the current batch of
the data this momentum technique works
very well and often leads to better
convergence the second one is learning
rate decay remember when replacing
gradient descent with SGD I said that we
were going to take smaller noisier steps
towards our objective how small should
that step be that's a whole area of
research as well one thing that's always
the case however is that it's beneficial
to make that step smaller and smaller as
you train some like to apply an
exponential decay to the learning rate
some like to make it smaller every time
the loss which is a plateau there are
lots of ways to go about it but lowering
it over time is the key thing to
remember</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
