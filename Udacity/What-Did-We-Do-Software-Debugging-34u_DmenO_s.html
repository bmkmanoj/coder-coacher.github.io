with an initial hypothesis from this
hypothesis we have made predictions we
have made experiments we checked with
the experiments validated the prediction
if they did we refined our hypothesis if
they didn't we came up with alternate
hypothesis we have repeated the process
until we came up with the diagnosis that
is a theory that is consistent with our
earlier observation and that also
predicts future observations in our case
the correct behavior based on this
diagnosis how the failure came to be we
have fixed the code accordingly and we
have seen in our additional experiments
that the theory holds that is the
diagnosis was valid from the beginning
on and therefore was a correct
explanation of how the figure came to be
note that there is many ways to come up
with initial hypothesis there's also
many ways to refine hypothesis and
reject the hypothesis note that there
may be multiple hypotheses to start with
and also of course during the scientific
method you may come up with different
hypotheses if you have two competing
hypotheses for the same failure well
what you do is you set up an experiment
that decides which of the hypothesis is
supported and which of the hypothesis is
rejected at the end there should be only
one hypothesis there should be only one
theory and there should be only one
diagnosis on how the failure came to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
