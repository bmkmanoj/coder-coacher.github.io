that happen in the distributed system
I'm giving you one specific example here
a client makes a call to a file system
and the directory server of the file
system makes call to the data servers
where the file is actually located so
all of these are IPC calls but under the
cover a shadow graph structure emerges
which is a trail of the client-server
interactions the client opening the file
so the TM on the owner has a link to a
TM on the directory manager and the
directory manager is calling the data
servers on two different nodes and
correspondingly there is a link from the
transaction manager on the directory
server to the transaction manager on the
data server on these two different nodes
so if you look at it from the point of
view of the transaction tree the client
is the owner of the transaction tree and
all of these sites are participants in
the transaction tree I mentioned earlier
that as the owner of a transaction tree
the owner has the right to delegate the
ownership to someone else why would they
want to do that if you think about it
from the point of view of the
distributed system that we are talking
about the most fragile parts of the
distributed system are the clients they
have the fickle minded ones who can go
away you can abort a file request that
they started and so on so in that sense
if the root of the transaction tree is
on a client node then cleaning up the
breadcrumbs may become hard if the
client box goes away because the owner
will go away and that's the reason the
owner can delegate the ownership to any
node in the distributed system and that
node becomes the transaction manager for
this particular transaction tree in
terms of what needs to be done to clean
up anything that happens adversely
during the interaction that I'm showing
you in this particular picture so the
heavy lifting that Quicksilver does has
to do with what it needs to do under the
covers in keeping this audit trail of
transactions corresponding to the IPC
interactions from the point of view of
covery let's talk about how this audit
trail is managed by Quicksilver in order
to facilitate recovery management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
