plain text into an intelligible form
that is given that the attacker can
obtain the ciphertext we don't want the
attacker to be able to learn about the
plain text in order to accomplish this
we apply two principles the first is
called confusion it is a way to obscure
the relationship between the key and a
ciphertext that is although the attacker
can obtain the cipher text the attacker
will not be able to find out the key
this is typically achieved with
substitution for example in a
generalized substitution ciphers that we
have discussed each letter can be mapped
to any other letter confucian or
substitution along is not sufficient for
example even when a letter can be mapped
to any other letter the attacker can use
statistical analysis of letter
frequencies to break the scheme
therefore the second principle is
diffusion this means that the inference
of one plaintiff it is spread over many
bits in a ciphertext and the goal is to
hide the statistical properties of the
plaintext for example instead of mapping
an English letter to another English
letter we can map a letter to parts of
many 8-bit letters and if you do that
then the frequency distribution of
English letters would not be very useful
in code analysis we can achieve
diffusion with permutations further we
need this combination to affect every
bit of the ciphertext therefore
typically a block cipher has multiple
rounds where each round combines
substitution in permutation that is the
first round effects some parts of the
ciphertext in the next round
further propagates these effects into
other parts of the ciphertext eventually
all bits of ciphertext are affected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
