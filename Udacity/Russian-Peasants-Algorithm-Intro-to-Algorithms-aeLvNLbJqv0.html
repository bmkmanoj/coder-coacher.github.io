different algorithm that I learned under
the name Russian peasant algorithm if
you'd like to learn more about it you
can go to the wikipedia page called
ancient egyptian multiplication so this
is an algorithm that people actually
implemented by hand before there were
computers here's the Russian peasants
algorithm in Python and you can see it
follows a pretty closely along with the
naive algorithm that I described before
starts off assigning a and B to X and y
it starts off Z as an accumulator set to
0 and it's going to repeat while X is
bigger than 0 a bunch of steps that
involve accumulating values in Z and
making X smaller what makes this
algorithm work really well is when
doubling and halving numbers is really
easy to do if you not familiar with the
syntax this is saying take whatever the
binary representation of Y is and
shifted over one to the left this is
saying take whatever the binary
representation of X is and shift it over
to the right let's do a little quiz to
see if you know what that would do so
straightforward question what is 17 20
right pointy right one in Python 171 9 8
8 and 1/2 34</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
