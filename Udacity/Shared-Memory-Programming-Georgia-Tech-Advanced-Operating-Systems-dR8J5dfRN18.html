memory synchronization lock is a
primitive and particularly the mutual
exclusion lock as a primitive that is
used ubiquitously in writing shared
memory parallel programs to protect data
structure so that one thread can
exclusively modify the data and release
the lock so that another thread can
inspect the data later on and so on and
similarly barrier synchronization is
another synchronization primitive that
is very popular in scientific programs
and we've covered both of these in
fairly great detail in talking about
what the operating system has to do in
order to have efficient implementation
of locks as well as barriers now the
upshot is if you're writing a shared
memory program there are two types of
memory accesses that are going to happen
one type of memory access is the normal
reads and writes to shared data that is
being manipulated by a particular thread
the second kind of memory access is
going to be for synchronization
variables that are used in implementing
locks and barriers by the operating
system itself it may be the operating
system or it could be a user level
threads library that is providing these
mutual exclusion locks our barrier
primitives but in implementing those
synchronization primitives those
algorithms are going to use reads and
writes to shared memory so there are two
types of shared memory accesses going on
in the execution of a parallel program
one is access to normal shared data and
the other is access to synchronization
variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
