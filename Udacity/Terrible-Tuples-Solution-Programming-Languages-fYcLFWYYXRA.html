a lexer for a new programming language
in the second problem we're going to
write a parser that'll create an
abstract syntax tree for something
similar to the lists and tuples that we
find in python we're only going to
consider numbers but we are going to
recognize the difference between a list
that has brackets and a tuple that has
parentheses so in our parser we have
expressions and let's say an expression
can be a number a list of expressions
and lastly a tuple of expressions so
let's start off with numbers here's our
parsing roll for the number expression
we simply take in the number and put it
in a tuple where the first element is
the type following our convention in our
web browser and the second element is
going to be the value so here i've
written out the function for tuple
expressions we have a left parenthesis
this new thing called exp comma and then
a right parenthesis so basically our
tuples surrounded by parentheses here I
haven't defined this yet and what this
is going to be is going to be a sequence
of expressions where there is a comma
separating each expression we'll define
that last and we'll also be using it in
the list expression here I have a
special rule that takes care of the case
just a single expression surrounded by
parentheses in reality we want our
language to take this as just an
expression which is what happens in
Python in Python if you wanted to make
this a tuple a tuple of one element you
have to add a comma otherwise we're
going to set this element in our
abstracts index tree to be a tuple where
the first element is the string tuple
followed by the value here's my function
for the list expression it's a going to
be exp comma which is that's construct
right up here surrounded by brackets and
we don't have the special case that we
have right here because we want our
language to have singleton lists so we
want the character a or I guess since we
have just numbers 5 to be a valid list
this is not the same idea as doing
five star term in parentheses we want
that just to be five so we have the
basics here let's just go to the code to
finish it up so here we have the problem
description and I filled in the solution
we have the number expression the tuple
and the list which are unchanged from
what I did but I've also added the
expression comma where an expression
comma is an expression comma followed by
an expression comma where an expression
comma can also be just an expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
