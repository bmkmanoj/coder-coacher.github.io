your business is the right option for
you before we get started what is
bootstrapping bootstrapping is the act
of financing your business using your
own personal resources you'll use what
you currently have available to start
building and growing your company there
are a few things to be aware of before
considering bootstrapping for your
business first let's look at some of the
benefits will focus on three major
benefits of bootstrapping freedom
profits and commitment first freedom
financing your business yourself
provides you a level of freedom not
available to you once investors become
involved sometimes you need to be
flexible and make tough choices being on
your own you don't need to rationalize
with investors this will allow you to
make your own decisions about what is
best for the company that said you can't
build a business in a vacuum successful
boots trappers leverage their personal
and professional networks and grow their
businesses organically remember to focus
on your customer base social presence
and the momentum you generate through
your business's popularity next profits
without investors the profits your
business generates come straight to you
when bootstrapping you retain equity in
your company and hold shares that would
normally go to investors if they had put
money into your startup and finally
commitment there's nothing that gets you
motivated to figure out your business
quite like financing it yourself
bootstrapping can give you the extra
incentive needed to work the long hours
necessary to become successful this
experience can definitely help you
become a more resourceful entrepreneur
while there are benefits to
bootstrapping it's important to
understand some ways it might not be so
great let's focus on three major
downsides of bootstrapping expenses
connections and credibility first
expenses launching your startup can take
a lot of money trying to supply this on
your own can become detrimental to your
personal expenses this could end up
affecting decisions you make if you're
low on money you might end up making
changes that aren't in the best interest
of your company to chase early profits
this can really stunt your long-term
growth next connections a lot of
investors have been in business for many
years and have access to tons of
resources working on your own you
have less of these resources available
for your business you also lose any
access to the people within the
investors network who could advise you
as you build your company when
bootstrapping you're missing out on some
of these opportunities for growth and
finally being backed by the right
investor gives immediate credibility to
your business when bootstrapping you
might not be able to get this otherwise
without investor support it could make
it more difficult to get investment in
later seed rounds so take some time to
consider the benefits and downsides of
bootstrapping your startup when you're
ready decide if you think this would be
a good option for your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
