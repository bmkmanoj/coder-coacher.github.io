the Play Store and download apps onto
their phone that support Android auto
they then connect their phone to the car
the phone goes into car mode and casts
the Android auto experience to the card
screen this means that although all the
apps and services are actually running
on the phone they're displayed in the
cars dash and you interact with them
using the vehicles controls such as a
built-in touchscreen and microphone now
because of this you don't need to write
a new app instead you can just extend
your existing Android apps to work in
the car now there are two great use
cases for this today audio and messaging
audio apps such as music radio and audio
book players which are an awesome way to
stay entertained while you're driving
can now be extended into the car the
api's are available to expose content
receive playback control and customize
the UI messaging applications which are
a great way to stay connected while
you're driving can now be extended to
the car as well ap is are available to
show notifications playback the message
and even reply with speech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
