relationship patterns for much of the
rest of the Union we will look at an
example of the producer consumer pattern
but for going into that however I want
to put it in context by taking a broader
view of possible thread relationships to
give our thread something to do will
imagine that we are servicing some
requests that come through a queue in
the team model we have a pool of workers
threads that all look in the queue fetch
the next request and services this idea
of a worker pool is common to many
patterns the cost of creating a new
thread are fairly high so rather than
spending time creating in destroying
threads applications will simply let the
threads wait around until there's work
for them to do a model similar to the
teen model is the dispatcher model here
instead of having a whole team of
threads constantly looking at our queue
and possibly creating some contention we
have a single dispatcher thread looking
at the queue he finds an available
worker and passes the request off to the
worker to be serviced instead of
dividing up the work by requests it's
also possible to divide it up by sub
task this is the strategy employed in
the pipeline model one thread dq's a
request does part of the work and then
passes it on to another thread who does
part of the work passes it on etc so all
three of these models are commonly used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
