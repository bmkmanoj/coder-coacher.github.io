such as gangsta rap nerdcore hip-hop and
crunk um I mean there are three main
ways with in WebGL repeating a texture
these are called rap modes here's a demo
showing them in action the repeat mode
is the one you're most likely to use it
simply repeats a texture one after
another if you want to have things look
continuous such as water then the
texture itself needs to be what is
called seamless where its edges match up
if your texture is not seamless one
cheap way to title it across the plane
is to set the rat mode to be mirror
repeat this concrete texture is not
seamless I just grabbed a piece of an
image on wikimedia commons with mirror
repeat on the texture flips on each
repetition this is a bit easier to see
with the art texture this rat mode is
not a great solution it's often clear
that the texture is being flipped in
this way still it's better than nothing
the third wrap mode is called clamped to
edge the drawback or feature of this
mode is that the pixels on the edge are
used to fill in the area where the
texture does not appear this is the
default mode for wrapping as it has some
advantages for filtering along the edges
when the texture is not going to be
repeated this code shows how to set each
of the three wrap modes in three jas the
s and T axes essentially mean the U and
V axes you can in fact mix and match
these modes repeating on one axis and
clapping on the other now give the demo
a try yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
