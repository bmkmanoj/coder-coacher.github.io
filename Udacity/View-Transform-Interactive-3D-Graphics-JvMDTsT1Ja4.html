orient a camera in world space if we
apply this matrix e to some camera
object the camera then gets placed in
the world however we want exactly the
opposite of this we don't want to
position the camera with respect to the
world we want to position the world with
respect to the camera think about what's
happening
we have some objects in a scene they
perhaps had a number of modeling
transforms applied to them the objects
are now all positioned in world space
what we want to do now is transform the
world to the cameras frame of reference
here's a camera and a model say we slide
the camera five units along the world's
x axis from the cameras point of view if
we subtracted five from all the world
coordinates everything would be nicely
oriented for the camera the long and
short here is that we use the inverse of
the matrix that would position the
camera in the world inverting basically
says no it's all about me the camera
reorient everything with respect to me
me me this inverse matrix is called the
view matrix for this reason this view
matrix is sometimes written as the
inverse of the camera matrix the matrix
that would move the camera to its place
in world space another way to think of
this view transform is simply as the
very last modeling matrix in the chain
the M matrix here represents all the
transforms needed to get the object into
world space modeling transforms now one
last transform the view matrix V takes
the objects in world space and moves
them into the cameras frame of reference
if you deal with WebGL or OpenGL
directly you'll see these two matrices
put together as a single matrix called
the modelview matrix this matrix is
applied to an object immediately taking
it from its own model space to view
space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
