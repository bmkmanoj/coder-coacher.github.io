racing car jr. in action applying the
exact same algorithm for actual driving
and you can see here that a right turn
is being executed followed by a lane
shift these are discrete actions in the
car actually performs those to reach a
goal location at the orange circle but
if we make a lane shift prohibitively
expensive just as we made a left turn
expensive before then the car chooses a
different path it goes straight then
takes a left turn which right now isn't
that expensive and it takes a left turn
and left turn again to find itself in
the lane where the goal location is
located there is a result of modifying
cost functions in our dynamic
programming algorithm in the same 3d
regime we just studied and did you just
programmed so your program could
effectively drive this car and by
changing these cost functions as you can
see over here the car will be able to
attain his goal in the optimal way
relative to the costs that you have
given him so congratulations you made it
through my first motion class today we
assumed that the world is discrete and
we looked at two planning algorithms a
star would use a heuristic to find a
path and dynamic programming which finds
an entire policy there is a plan for
every location we implemented both of
them in fact in the policy case even in
3d which is quite an achievement and I'm
going to congratulate you to get here
you we now understand two of the main
paradigms for which our robots make
motion decisions and they're also some
very major paradigms for artificial
intelligence in general in next class we
talk about how to turn this into actual
robot motions we talked about continuous
state spaces and we talked about what's
called control in which we make a robot
move I'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
