tuned shading or cell shading or
sometimes posterization tune is short
for cartoon cell is short for celluloid
the material for the transparent sheets
that are used when animation is drawn by
hand there are all sorts of variations
for this type of rendering for example
you can change colors based on the
shading level and get more elaborate
effects in this rendering a separate
image processing shader is used to
detect the edges of the object and
outline them this type of illumination
model is one example of what's called
non-photorealistic rendering or NPR for
short photorealistic means looks like a
photo if you think about it there's a
nearly infinite number of ways to draw
things that do not look realistic the
running joke is that we've been doing
non-photorealistic rendering on
computers for decades since realism is
hard to achieve the way I see it is that
non-photorealistic rendering has an
intent behind it just as we assign
different fonts to text to convey a
different impression NPR is a choice we
can make about 3d rendering Scott
McCloud in his book understanding comics
talks about amplification through
simplification the idea is that by
displaying only the relevant pieces of
information you strengthen your message
for example an automobile owner manual
usually has simplified drawings instead
of photos non-photorealistic techniques
often try to convey information in a
more sketchy or artistic way for example
a sketchy look can let the viewer know
that the result they're looking at is in
just an early stage of design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
