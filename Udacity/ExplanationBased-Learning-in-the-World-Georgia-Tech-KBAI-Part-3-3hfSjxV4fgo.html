common in the real world you and I do it
all the time you need to prop open a
door you bring a chair and you use it to
prop up on the door because it just put
an explanation for why the chair in fact
and pop open a door there is a sheaf of
papers in a desk with a shuffling around
you take a coffee mug put it on the
sheaf of paper that acts as a
paperweight and another example
explanation based learning you and I are
constant dealing with novel situations
we are constantly coming up with
creative solutions to them how do we do
it one way is that we use existing
concepts but use them in new ways we
find new connections between them by
building explanations for them this is
sometimes called speed up learning
because we are not learning new concepts
with simply connecting existing concepts
but it's a very powerful way of dealing
with a large number of situations and
today in class we learn how we can build
AI agents that can do the same thing
that you and I do so well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
