we've seen is the the announcement of
the Titan supercomputer which is now the
fastest supercomputer in the world and
this has Nvidia processors at its core
can you talk a little bit about that
process and how Nvidia got to be
involved and why that's such an exciting
thing for GPU computing well first of
all you know Titan is is an awesome
machine it's 616 excuse me
18,000 688 Kepler k20 GPUs and is the
fastest computer in the world at running
high-performance wind pack there's an
interesting story there the the story of
Titan actually starts with a meeting
that I had with Steve Scott who at the
time was CTO of Cray at the Sal Shan
conference up on the Oregon coast in
2009 and I was talking to Steve and
trying to say how can we work together
we really should get NVIDIA GPUs and to
create supercomputers because you know
we have the best you know sort of
compute per dollar compute per watt
which are the two things that matter in
high-performance computing of anybody in
the world and and they were actually
going through a problem because they had
bet on a different vendor who cancelled
a project on them and it left a whole
sort of in what they wanted to bid for
this solicitation that was out from
Oakridge to build their what they call
their leadership class computing
facility ultimately what turned in into
Titan and it was it was a nice sort of
juxtaposition in time that I was having
this conversation with with him right at
the point in time where there was a hole
to be filled and it turns out Kepler
filled that hole wonderfully there are a
lot of challenges along the way that I
think really had to do with getting the
people in National Labs to embrace sort
of the the model of parallelism that
cooter presents I think that once they
embraced it they found was actually
easier to write their programs that way
and they actually ran better across the
board once they were reorganised into
the a that style of parallelism of
launching CTAs and and organizing things
in that style but they had a very large
chunk of legacy code mostly in Fortran
that was coded sort of Fortran running
on a single node with MPI used to
communicate between the nodes and it was
a non-trivial exercise to really sort of
bring that software over and get it to
run well on a GPU accelerated system and
I think beyond the Linpack time
which is actually relatively easy number
to get because it's one program what
really is a success of Titan is the very
large number of the basic energy science
and and defense codes that have been
ported over very successfully get just
tremendous performance on the on the K
20s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
