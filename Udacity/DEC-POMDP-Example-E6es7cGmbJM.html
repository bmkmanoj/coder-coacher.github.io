simple example very tiny little example
but it may be challenging so here's
here's what's gonna happen we are in a
little 4 room Museum and we're
interested in in visiting together
exploring the museum but the first thing
we have to do is actually end up in the
same place so we each know which state
we are in you're in state 4 by the way
okay but you don't know which state the
other person is in you don't know where
I am for example I know where I am but I
don't know where you are we win if we
end up in the same state you can go
basically north south east west or stay
put and if a and we're gonna move
simultaneously if a turn ends and we're
both in the same place we win okay so
normally you would have to you know
issue these commands into the
environment right you like walk around
by yourself but you need to tell me what
you're what you're gonna do so I can
keep track okay and all I can do is move
north south east numbers or you can stay
put or I can stay put yeah okay and for
what it's worth in the deck palm DP
model it's a planning problem so we can
actually make up a strategy in advance
as long as we don't use it as part of
the strategy what state were we're
starting in because we don't know that
those that we can talk about what our
strategy would be yeah well I can think
of sort of three classes of strategies
okay so one would be one of us decides
and never to move so let the other let
the other person move around good that
way we can't just miss each other right
uh-huh
and so I could not move or you could not
move uh-huh I was actually seeing those
two separate things the other one would
be we just agree on a set of actions
that we will take that guarantee that we
will end up in the same state well maybe
one way to do that is which we'll pick
out like a focal point we'll pick a room
that we should both go to right I was
thinking three because the reason I
favor remember oh nice okay
so which of these strategies do you
suppose is better it depends on exactly
how you know rewards and discount
factors are defined if yeah that's true
but if we just think about cost somehow
being how long it takes us to get there
okay I actually guess going to the same
room as
probably the best one because no matter
where you are the longest you can either
take zero steps to get there mm-hmm
one step to get there are two steps to
get there good good I think you're right
actually so let's let's do that so we
design in advance that we're gonna
converge on room three mm-hm and you you
know wake up and you find you're in room
four to start but I don't know that but
I know what room I'm in and now we both
get to choose an action wait and I would
choose the action left assuming we
aren't in the same room I would choose
the action left okay all right and I
will tell you that that puts you in room
three mm-hmm and I take an action that
is trying to also move me towards room
three and it worked well we're both in
room three we're both in room three yay
hey what do you wanna see first room
three this is the salvador dali room Oh
excellent
all right so so this worked out actually
really well for us but you can imagine
if this was a much more complicated
domain if there's a lot of stochasticity
if our task was more complicated it
might be very difficult to know what to
do for example what if you thought you
were in room four but you were actually
in room two because you know partial
observable States being what they are so
you might not even know that you're not
in room three yet and it might be very
difficult to get there and know that you
got well I would hope that there would
be some room where we know whether we're
that room or not
we never sure we're sure I don't know I
mean whenever you do this in a real
museum right that's what you do you
don't look just I'll meet you at the
entrance well I thought it was the
jurassic room but it was actually the
cretaceous room this is why i pick an
enter the entrance or something oh I see
yeah like a good focal room so like one
like the entrance no three was the
entrance that's why I picked it all
right done and done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
