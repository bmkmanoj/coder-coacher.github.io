limited dynamic range of current cameras
here is an image i took again in my home
here basically a short exposure
remembering again the concepts of
exposure that we've looked at from
exposure triangle and stuff in when we
talk about cameras and here if you look
at it you should be able to see it's a
dark scene but outside you can see a
little bit of snow I took this picture
or not you know one of the rare snowy
days in Atlanta but it's a short
exposure you can't see any of the
details inside but look outside you can
see a lot of snow and brightness same
image or same scene different exposure
values long exposure of course all of
the insides are nice and visible now but
you might think that there's a lot of
overexposure going on at this point and
the details outside are not good so this
is an underexposed image this is an
overexposed image underexposed because
lots of pixels did not get any detail
lots of black pixels here over expose a
lot of white bright pixels so you if you
were to build histograms with these
images you would start seeing lot more
variants on the white pixels and for
this one you'd see a lot more black
pixels again note both of them are
exactly the same scene they're not even
at different times of the day they were
taken seconds after each other and
that's the kind of stuff that basically
what cameras give you right now and that
is a limited dynamic range and now of
course we're interested in is capturing
the range from here to there to capture
this dynamic range we basically need
five to 10 million values to store all
the brightness around us remember the
luminosity stuff that I showed you the
scale of information was significant
here we want to basically able to
capture all of this in one image problem
is and recall when we started talking
about images most images capture each of
the three different channels in basic
8-bit images values of 0 to 255 some
time basically just put in values of 0
to 1 point 0 but again there are only
256 values as opposed to much bite
arrange that would cover the range from
here to there nowhere close to of course
being able to capture 5 to 5 to 10
million values
just to showcase this let's look at this
example again here if you notice I'm
showing you the high dynamic range in
the real world this was a dynamic range
from 10 raise to minus 6 to 10 raise to
6 and that's what we're trying to look
at of course when a photograph what we
would most of all we do is just showcase
this one and that's what basically shown
here I'm basically showing all the
values that are much more in brighter
side and focusing it here the other end
of the spectrum is the long exposure and
of course this is the long exposure in
mich again lot more bright values and
here what we will be doing in this
dynamic range is most probably just
capture the region here and pack it into
my 0-255 values again a lot of detail
would be lost here I'm basically showing
you more of the information on this side
of the spectrum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
