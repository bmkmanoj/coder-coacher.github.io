the polyline to the map with all my
different ice rinks so to draw the
polyline I set up the latitudes and
longitudes for all the different ice
rinks Renton Kirkland Everett Linwood
etc and this time I'm just setting them
as lat/long object earlier they were
marker options but now they're just
latitudes and longitudes I set up my
camera position to be exactly the same
as I did in the earlier sample now in my
own map ready I just moved the camera to
my camera position which is Seattle and
then to draw the polyline I just called
map polyline it's a new polyline objects
geodesic true and then I just add all of
the and then I just add all of the
latitudes and longitudes that I had
created earlier renton Kirk and Everett
Linwood notice that I begin a Trenton
and then I also add Renton at the end
and then this just closes the shape
because what will happen when you draw a
polyline is all draw from Renton to
Kirkland from Kirkland to Everett from
Everett and Lynwood etc so if I want to
close the shape I just want to go back
to the initial one at the end and then I
will get all of my rinks drawn into a
polygon type shape by adding a polyline
and this is what it will look like here
you can see on my tablet I have the same
map of Seattle and have all the
endpoints of the different rinks my home
rink of Renton that I showed earlier on
is the beginning and ending point and
then the polylines get drawn from rent
into other rinks so for example this is
the rink at Kings gate you can see Kings
gate highlighted there or I can go all
the way up to the rink in Everett etc so
these are the poly lines that are drawn
from me connecting the rinks and because
I just joined the last rink it show
we're back to Renton in my code the
shape gets completed and as you can see
here my second last one was show where I
then added Renton and the shape got
completed so my polyline actually became
a polygon you can actually also do a
math dot ad polygon and specify the
endpoints and it will auto close it for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
