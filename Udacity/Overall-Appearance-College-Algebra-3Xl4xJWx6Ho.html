function like y equals one it looks like
this just a straight horizontal line now
if we increase the degree of this by one
right now this is a zero with degree
polynomial if we up by one we get
something like y equals x which takes
that horizontal line and just rotate now
it has a nonzero slope now if we
increase the power by one more we get a
parabola a quadratic function and we
know if we increase it by one more once
again we get this really cool cubic
function not you just saw your first
higher order polynomial in the last quiz
and I think that we should focus on one
of these in particular for right now
let's look at the graph of y equals x to
the fifth minus X let's just look at the
overall appearance of this function and
then build up some information about
polynomial functions in general based on
that we saw a big picture of this graph
earlier showing pretty big range on the
y-axis and a pretty big part of the
domain on the X but now I've zoomed into
the middle where some of the most
interesting stuff is happening remember
that the ends of the graph this way in
this way we're just sort of continuing
on for a long time in the same direction
so it seems like all the changes are
happening in here because this is the
only area where things are changing
against put the domain into sections
based on what's happening in here I see
one change happening right around here
and another change happening right
around here so at these lines I have
effectively divided the domain into
three chunks three different intervals
now let's label these intervals interval
one interval to and interval three it
also seems like there are two special
points these two right here I'll call
them in this bright blue color and label
them points a and B these are of course
the points where these lines separating
the parts the domain from one another
intersect the graph of our function so
let's talk about what the graph looks
like within each of these intervals and
why these two points are special now
first of all can you tell me in which of
these intervals the graph is increasing
and in which of them the graph is
decreasing and second which of these two
points is a relative maximum and which
one is a relative minimum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
