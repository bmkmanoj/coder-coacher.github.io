before mental illness is pretty common
something that every family experiences
either directly or indirectly because of
this mental health literacy is something
that we should strive for is a culture
given that almost half of us will
experience some type of disorder in our
life in addition over half of the people
who experience at least 1 psychological
disorder will also experience a second
disorder having two or more mental
disorders occurring at the same time is
termed comorbidity the new dsm-5 lists
21 major categories of disorders and
over 350 distinct disorders now as we
mentioned at the beginning of the lesson
we want to remind you that not all
psychologists agree with the categories
in the dsm-5 or with the notion that
there are 350 distinct disorders and
also it's important to know that what's
considered a disorder in the past
sometimes changes over time so the DSM
isn't set in stone
for example homosexuality was listed as
a mental disorder in the DSM which
clearly we know no longer is the case
nevertheless given the historical use of
the DSM we'll discuss some of these
categories in this lesson
specifically we'll discuss some of the
21 major categories of disorders
including neurodevelopmental disorders
depressive disorders bipolar disorders
anxiety disorders obsessive-compulsive
disorder post-traumatic stress disorder
dissociative disorders somatic symptom
disorder z' personality disorders and
finally schizophrenia</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
