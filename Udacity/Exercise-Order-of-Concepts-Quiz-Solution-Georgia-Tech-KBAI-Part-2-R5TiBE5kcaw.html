so at the top I put right triangle
because we actually defined axiomatic
concepts as things that can be defined
mathematically with necessary and
sufficient conditions and right triangle
seems like a very emblematic example of
that reptile I also put close to the top
because in the biological definition
there are necessary and sufficient
conditions for being a reptile they may
differ a little bit from the way you and
I think of reptiles so we might have
more of a prototype concept of reptiles
but in biology there is a very formal
definition of what a reptile is with foo
we kind of built our understanding based
on different examples so we had kind of
a prototype you at foo and similarly
with holiday you can think of examples
of holiday you don't really have a
definition that something has to meet to
be a holiday but you can think of
holidays is sometimes being a day that
you get the day off it sometimes a day
that's a particular day of the week or a
particular date of the month so there
are different things that are over I
dab'll about different holidays
inspirational is something that's a
little bit hard to define what makes
something inspirational but you and I
can very easily come up with some
examples of some things that are
inspirational such as watching someone
win in the Olympics or listening to a
moving rendition of the national anthem
those are two different things that are
very very different but have the same
kind of underlying concept behind them
and insulting this reflects what you
were saying earlier Ashok about tastes
that can be very difficult to describe
to another person so part of the point
of looking at this different kind of
concepts is that depending on the
different kind of concept we are dealing
with right now we may come up with a
different knowledge representation and a
different inference method let me
explain supposing we're dealing with
concepts like foo or holiday
inspirational the case based reasoning
method might be a very good method for
dealing with things of that kind we may
have experience with specific holidays
but we cannot abstract them out into a
concept with Kurt a typical conditions
on the other hand if we were dealing
with concepts like a right triangle or a
reptile which we can define necessary
and sufficient conditions in that case
there are alternative methods available
that might be most suitable in case
based reasoning so instead of thinking
in terms of one method that is going to
work for all conditions and all concepts
we might want to think in terms of a
array of methods where each
that is more or less useful for
different kind of conditions for
different kind of concepts even I'm sure
you recall Mendeleev who was a Russian
chemist who came up with the basic
notion of the chemical periodic table
I'm sure all the students in the class
nobody chemical periodic table which
organizes all the elements according to
certain properties like hydrogen oxygen
calcium and so on now Mendeleev came up
with this notion of a chemical periodic
table in some sense what we are trying
to do in this course is to build a
similar kind of periodic table accepted
this is a periodic table of the elements
of mind it's a periodic table ready
basic fundamental elements that compose
intelligence instead of talking about
elements and valances and atoms and so
on what we are going to be talking about
our methods and representations so it is
as if we are discovering the fundamental
knowledge representations and
organizations in reasoning methods that
go with it case-based reasoning was one
reasoning method that went with certain
kinds of concepts that are hard to
abstract into conditions like typical
conditions are necessary logical
conditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
