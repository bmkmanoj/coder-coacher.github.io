one's a little bit more difficult if you
got 160 you got a right even though this
is an absolute value problem we also
have to follow the order of operations
the absolute value symbols act as
parentheses as well we know when we're
working with parentheses we need to work
from the innermost parentheses outward
so first thing we have to do is evaluate
what is inside these parentheses and
follow the order of operations and then
we'll move on the first thing I want to
do is evaluate this 6 squared 6 squared
is 36 so this turns into 6 minus 36
first we want to evaluate 6 squared 6
squared is 36 so here we have 6 minus 36
we still have another operation inside
the parentheses before we can move to
operations outside these parentheses so
here I have to evaluate 6-36 6-36 is
negative 30 now that I finished
evaluating what's inside the parentheses
I can move to what's inside the absolute
value symbols when I'm working inside
the absolute value symbols i still have
to follow the order of operations so I
have an exponent let's evaluate that
first I have 2 times the absolute value
of negative 5 squared now we have to
evaluate negative 5 squared since the
negative is not in parentheses negative
is not part of the base so we have
negative 1 times 5 squared and we know
that 5 squared is 25 and I copy down the
rest of the operations I know when I
write two numbers next to each other
that i have to multiply them so the next
thing I need to do inside my absolute
value is to evaluate the two
multiplications in order from left to
right so i have 2 times the absolute
value of negative 1 times 25 which is
negative 25 negative 25 times negative 2
is positive 50 then i have negative 1
times negative 30 which gives me a
positive 30 so i have 2 times the
absolute value of negative 1 times 25
which is negative 25 times negative 2 is
positive 50 and then i have negative 1
times negative 30 gives me a positive 30
now that I've performed the
multiplication and division inside the
absolute value I can do the addition and
subtraction so i have 2 times the
absolute value of 50 plus 30 which is 80
since absolute value is the distance a
number is from 0 we know that the
absolute value of 80 is simply a tee so
the last step is to x 80 + 2 x 80 gives
us our answer of 160</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
