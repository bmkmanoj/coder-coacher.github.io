education at MongoDB MongoDB is the
company behind the open source no sequel
database of the same name
prior to joining MongoDB I was a
computer scientist working in academia
and consulting on a number of different
data science projects in the financial
industry social media and other spaces
this is a class about data wrangling
data scientists spend about 70 percent
of their time data wrangling so what is
data wrangling well it's a process of
gathering extracting cleaning and
storing our data only after that does it
really make sense to do any analysis so
if you're a quant on Wall Street and you
want to build models to automate trading
you first need to make sure you're
basing your models on reliable data or
if you're building a Maps app you need
to ensure your data is correct or you
can quickly find yourself in something
of a public relations disaster as
another example if you're working on a
smaller scale analyzing data for a
research team you want to ensure your
team can make decisions based on the
data you're providing if you don't take
the time to ensure your data is in good
shape before doing any analysis you run
a big risk of wasting a lot of time
later on or worse losing the faith of
your colleagues who depend on the data
you prepared it's a little like putting
the cart before the horse so while we're
going to get to some analysis that's why
we're doing all this in the first place
this class is really about getting your
data ready so that any analysis is built
on a solid foundation of good data here
you're going to get a chance to do some
tinkering we're going to develop your
hacker muscles or should I say Wrangler
muscles we'll work with lots of
different types of data for music energy
Wikipedia and Twitter to name a few
we'll also teach you how to work with
data in most of the format's you're
likely to see JSON XML CSV Excel and
HTML and even some legacy text formats
in the last half of the course we'll
show you how to store your data in
MongoDB and use it to support analysis
MongoDB is becoming increasingly
important to data scientists around the
world as a powerful and scalable tool
for big data problems and we'll wrap it
up with a case study that allows you to
put all the pieces together we're happy
to have you in the class let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
