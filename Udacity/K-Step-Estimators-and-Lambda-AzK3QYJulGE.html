estimators that we just talked about
with TD lambda so the idea is this take
we're actually going to be using a
weighted combination of all of the
estimators on for it for any one of
these TD lambda algorithms and the
weights are gonna look like this 1 minus
lambda for the one step estimator lambda
times one minus lambda for the two step
estimator lambda squared times 1 minus
lambda for the 3 step estimator lambda
to the K minus 1 times 1 minus lambda
for the K step estimator and then all
the way down to essentially lambda the
infinity but of course that one
literally doesn't get any wait wait what
except well exit just let's leave it at
that for now and then we'll explain why
that's an okay thing to say in a second
ok um so so far everything you said
makes sense except you haven't told me
what you're waiting exactly oh so what
we're gonna do is when we move the the
value when we change the value of a
state we're going to change it by all
the different estimators all the
estimate all the different estimators
are going to give us their own
preference as to what we should be
moving the value toward and we're just
going to take a convex combination a
weighted combination of all of them each
time that we do an update for the value
of a state Oh
now we don't literally get to to list
all of these and update based on them
but equivalently this is this is what
we're doing and so let's there's a
couple things that we should probably
check one is we should probably make
sure that these weights sum up to 1
mm-hmm
so how do we do that so let's see you
write a summation good idea so the
summation is the all the different
estimators from 1 to infinity of the
weight apply to that estimator which
this works for this formula works for
all the different values of K for for K
equals 1 it's lambda to the 0 which is 1
times 1 minus lambda so we can now
factor out the 1 minus lambda as long as
lamp is less than 1 we can use this as
the geometric series and we get 1 over 1
minus lambda and that's going to cancel
with this 1 minus lambda and so the
weights sum up to 1 if lambda equals 1
though what happens then these are all
zeros and then this infinity 1 is 1 to
the infinity which is just 1 so when
lambda is 1 we put all our
wait on this last estimator and what
happens when lambda 0 so if lambda 0 in
this case we get a weight of 1 on this
first estimator and 0 all the rest which
I'll write down this way and when lambda
is 1 we get 0 for all these except for
the last one which let's say least in
the limit would be 1 so this is actually
as we said this is giving us TD 0 and
this is giving us TD 1 so if we just use
lambda in place of 1 and 0 which works
then we get TD lambda but the important
thing is that for in between values of
lambda like 1/2 or 0.3 or something like
that we actually get weights on all of
these to some degree and it's combining
all those different estimators together
and that seems ok getting any good
characterization of what that weight
looks like so if lambda were equal to
1/2 is that exactly halfway between TD 0
and TD 1 well when lambda is 1/2 what do
our weights look like we get a weight of
a half on this one we get a weight of
1/2 times 1/2 or 1/4 on this one we get
a weight of 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2 or
1/8 on this one so we get this this the
sequence of decreasing weights
exponentially decrease decreasing
weights is that halfway between these
two things I don't know I suppose you
could define it to be but it is just
what it is it's a combination of a whole
bunch of estimators together right that
eventually gets to zero sure but again
we're combining the outputs of all the
these estimators we're using whatever
update they're suggesting and and moving
a little bit in the direction of the
first one and a little less in the
direction of second one a little bit
less less in the direction of the third
one and so on so yeah and then in the
limit you know we're not actually doing
the Infinity estimator at all but that's
okay because we're doing all these other
estimators that kind of lead up to it so
I don't know does that does that help
you understand TD lambda better that
this is this is the way I think about it
is is to say well it's a little bit hard
to interpret but what we're really doing
is doing a weighted combination of a
bunch of step estimators
instead of you know this sort of strange
continuous parameter well I mean I guess
so I mean I when I when I when I think
about it the way you put it I guess what
you're saying is look you could do one
step look ahead or you could do two step
look ahead or you could go all the way
into the end of your episode which may
last forever and you could pick any one
of those or you could say each one of
those you know gives me some information
and I should just figure out some way to
combine them and I can pick various ways
with combining them and I don't
particularly know how to turn the way I
combine them into a simple English
sentence but I am finding ways to
combine various ones with them and I
should pick some value of lambda that
seems to work for the problem that I
care about yeah yeah all right so now
given that we don't actually have a
crisp characterization of what something
like lambda equals 1 or sorry lambda
equals 1/2 really gives us in words why
do we care about these intermediate
values so I'm gonna make a transition
and talk about next what happens
empirically when you use TD lambda okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
