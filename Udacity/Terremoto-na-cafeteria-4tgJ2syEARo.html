Catherine checking out this fantastic
snow report app I think it's time to
head to the mountains cool what are you
up to
well heading to New York so I just want
to check that my flight is on time nice
Joe what's going on over there so I'm
just catching up on the latest celebrity
tirade on Twitter
nice how about you Jessica um so I'm
playing with the mewhat calf we made but
there's one thing that's bugging me
about it though what's that well with
all the apps you're using the are
receive data from the internet but with
the me walk out we had to know all the
words ahead of time that's true yeah
what if we want to create an app that
display data about information we can't
know ahead of time so things like the
weather or oh my gosh what was that it's
an earthquake
get down oh no wait tweet Joe how can
you be tweeting right now around is
literally moving it's okay just breathe
Chris sometimes this happens in
California wait I think it just stopped
well I am definitely going to need
another cup of coffee
are you okay Chris well I think that was
my first earthquake how strong do you
think that was that was pretty strong
let me check
actually this could make a really good
app idea oh yeah well what would it do
well I could show you like the recent
earthquakes in the world like this one
yeah and you could use it to make a more
informed decision about where you want
to live yeah I guess though but
seriously if we were gonna build an app
like this well we would need the
earthquake data but then how do we get
it onto the phone you know I think Joe
could help us out with this he seems to
know a thing or two about networking oh
yeah totally we can pull data into an
app just like we browse the web oh yeah
cool in this next course you're gonna be
building an earthquake app I'm gonna let
Chris and Joe guide you along the way
sounds like a lot of fun Joe let's get
started building an earthquake app
hashtag oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
