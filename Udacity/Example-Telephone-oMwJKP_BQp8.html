of a state machine using slightly
different icons on things in this case
ovals for the state's we have the
telephone being off hook we have it a
when you're dialing or pressing the
buttons we have it when it's ringing
when it's busy when you are connected to
another party and when it's in a rest
state on hook on the extreme left notice
in that case that there are two ovals
nested inside of each other this is used
to designate what the default or start
state of the system is there are then
transitions these directed arcs going
among the states one to look at is the
one on the top right label dialing where
there's a transition from a state to
itself that is when you're dialing or
pressing the buttons okay you're doing
this several times and you remain in the
dialing state until you've finished
dialing now we could have had a machine
here that had numerous states as part of
the dialing process in which we dialed
the first digit the second digit and so
on and in that case it would be
different states until we eventually got
entered our local number or our long
distance number that would have
complicated the diagram and remember
these diagrams are abstractions we
abstract over the set of states and
abstract over the events that's that
your choice is a designer or a modeler
notice also that the diagram is somewhat
busy and that there are arcs that have
seemingly redundant labels this is
another example of a situation where
we'd like to improve the diagrams by by
simplifying them and that's where we're
going when we get to concurrent systems
model with state charts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
