these trees contains we want to see if a
given tree contains an element and the
real trick with contains is that I don't
have to look at the whole tree if I'm
given a very small element I'll just go
down the left path because I know it's
not in the right path similarly if I'm
given a really huge element I'll only go
down the right path because I know it's
not on the left this is a recursive
procedure so it has a base case if we're
at the bottom of the tree and we haven't
found it then we return false and now if
this element is exactly the element we
want we found it and then based on the
dictionary ordering will either call
ourselves recursively on the left child
only or on the right child only let's
see if our third tree contains midpoint
it should that's right at the top Oh
silly Python error else if is invalid
syntax yep they're exactly right and I'm
wrong I always get this wrong in Python
in Python elsif is written Elif now
let's try again true it does contain
midpoint excellent let's see if it
contains should not be there hint the
expected answer is false and look it is
false unfortunately there's actually a
bug in our code let's see if we can find
Jacob Zuma he should totally be there
but he's not we still get false well if
there's a bug in our code we have to
find a test case that shows it this is a
test case that shows it we tried a
simpler one just looking for midpoint
and that worked so we'll just stick with
this one for now our next step is to add
print statement debugging until we've
localized the fault so here at the top
of contains I'm just printing out the
current tree and the element we're
looking for and let's go see what
happens when we look for Jacob Zuma
first the tree is the entire huge tree
with at would Margaret the midpoint and
then Zuma Jacob and the element we're
looking for is Zuma Jacob so that's
looking good so far then we call
ourselves recursively and suddenly we're
looking at the left child now we're
looking inside the Margaret Atwood tree
for zuma Jacob that is not going to work
what this tells me is that we went left
when we should have gone right so
somewhere up here there was some mistake
involving one of these recursive calls
we went left but we should have gone
right well what's control
this decision it's the comparison
between this element and element here's
another quiz for you fill in this blank
with code that will make this work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
