a procedure that can help solve the
problem of figuring out how many
different ways there are to order
objects so here's the problem we want to
solve so suppose we have four blocks we
have a red block we have a blue block we
have a purple block and we have a green
block and we have a baby who wants to
play with the blocks and we want to know
how long can the baby play with the
blocks without getting bored and what
the baby wants to do is try all the
different ways of arranging the blocks
the baby will stack the blocks in a
tower so the baby might pick the red
block first put that on the ground then
put the blue block on top then put the
purple block on top of that and then put
the green block on top and when she's
made one tower she's gonna knock it down
and make another one and she's gonna
keep doing this as long as she can make
different color combinations if she has
to make the same tower twice well that's
pretty boring so maybe she'll make the
next one she'll pick the purple block
first then she'll pick the red block
then she'll pick the blue block and then
she'll pick the green block so these two
are different the question we want to
answer is how many different towers can
she build so given that she has four
blocks we want to know how many
different towers could you build with
four blocks but maybe she gets some more
blocks so what we really want to know is
given that she has n blocks whatever
number n is how many different towers
could you build where the color
combinations are all different so the
way to solve that is to think about
combinatoric s-- so the way to pick the
first block well it could be any one of
these four so we have four choices and
let's say for our example she chooses
the red block first now it's time to
choose the second block well she can't
use the red block again she's already
used it so she can either use the purple
the blue or the green block so she has
three choices now she can use the purple
block the blue block or the green block
so let's say she chooses the green block
so she's gonna have the
red block and then the green block she
had three choices she could have chosen
any of the other two but now that she's
chosen the red and the green she only
has two choices left for the third
like she can either use the purple one
or she could use the blue one those are
the only two that are left let's say she
uses the purple one now for the final
block well she's used the red one she's
used the green one she's used the purple
one the only one that's left is the blue
one so she has no choice but to use the
blue block that means for the fourth
block there was only one choice so for
each of these choices she could choose
any of the four for the first one any of
the three remaining ones for the second
one regardless of what she picked for
the first one so if she picked red she
could pick either purple blue or green
but if she'd picked say blue for the
first one then what she'd have left is
purple red and green so she always has
three choices for the second one after
that there's only two choices left
there's only two blocks left and she can
choose either one so the pattern here is
every time she chooses a block there's
one less because she's used the block in
the previous choice and for the total
number of choices what we want to do is
multiply all these numbers so to figure
out the total number of choices what we
need to do is multiply the number of
choices for the first block
and then we multiply that by the number
of choices for the second and we keep
going for however many choices there are
in this case they're only four until we
get down to one and each time we make a
choice well we have one fewer items left
to use for the next choice so the
function that we're computing here is
mathematically called factorial and it's
sometimes written with an exclamation
point and a way to define factorial is
for any value n we can compute the
factorial which is the number of ways of
arranging n items we can compute that by
multiplying n which is the number of
choices for the first item times n minus
one that's the number of choices we have
left for the second item times n minus
two that's the number of choices for the
third item and so forth all the way
until we get down to one so your goal
for this quiz is to define a procedure
named factorial that takes one number as
its input that's the number n here and
outputs the factorial of that number
which we can compute by multiplying n
times n minus 1 all the way down to 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
