like you to come here and start looking
at how we can apply this in a in a more
product I guess oriented sense yeah
Nvidia was a great partner in the
research they were giving sex it's the
hardware and some of the early specs so
we could think about where they were
going and how it influenced art research
when we're all said and done that you
know I got the opportunity to come to in
vidi and do it for real I started the
CUDA group with one other guy it was
just the two of us and we hired in a
compiler and library and QA guys and we
slowly built our way up this time really
taking the learnings from Brooke and
starting over a little bit and also
influencing some of the hardware design
the hardware architecture you know what
could we do to generalize the
architecture just a little bit to make
it a little easier to eliminate those
roadblocks that we discovered with
Brooke and then eventually come out with
our sort of CUDA at one point out so how
long did it take from the day you got
there and you started on this project to
the time it launched it was probably a
good two years of development work that
we were we were pushing to do this work
you know a lot of it was spec writing
kind of coming up with paper specs
writing some sample code examples seeing
if it was usable easy to use picking
between a variety different approaches
for how to express the parallelism
eventually we latched on to a very basic
idea of threading because we knew that
most you know C and C++ programmers
understood the concept of a thread at
least at the simplest level if we could
latch on to that we could actually
present a program model that was
familiar very early on in the CUDA
project we did a roadshow we went out
and we talked to him
every customer was willing to talk to us
saying tell us your problems are non
computing how can we help you and one of
the big sentiments was they didn't want
to learn a new language and you know
while I was tempting as a researcher to
come up with the new parallel
programming language of the world they
just wanted an easy way to get access to
the performance and they had a bunch to
C or C++ or Fortran of programmers so we
set out to start CUDA we made sure it's
not a new language it's just a couple of
simple extensions to C in C++ so that
anyone who knows those languages plus
has a basic understanding of threading
could get access to the GPS performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
