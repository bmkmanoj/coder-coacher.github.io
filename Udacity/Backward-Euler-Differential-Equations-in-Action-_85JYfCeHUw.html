the forward Euler method now we
introduce some changes to turn the
forward Euler method into the backward
Euler method this method is called an
implicit solver we are going to see why
the backward Euler method works like
this to go from the initial value of x
to the value after the first step it
added the step size times the rate of
change at time 0 the backward Euler
method works with a rate of change at
the end of the first step
X of H actually our estimate of the rate
of change at the end of the first step
keep in mind that I'm writing X of H but
I'm referring to my estimates the
numerical solution not the exact
solution this means that the value at
the end of the first steps appears on
the left hand side and on the right hand
side this is wire this is called an
implicit method we have to solve for x
of H it's hidden in this equation it's
not explicit so let's solve for x of H
bring this term over to the left hand
side then we have X at the end of the
first step plus time step times constant
times X at the end of the first step
equals the initial value we can factor
out X of H and find that X of H equals
the initial value divided by 1 plus HK
this is something like 1 over 1 plus 100
if it shows a really large age which
would be 1 over 101 if you form powers
of these they are going to decay pretty
quickly and there is no oscillation
whatsoever so we have no problem at all
with this expression it's always going
to work no matter how large the step
sizes this is very handy when one tries
to solve stiff differential equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
