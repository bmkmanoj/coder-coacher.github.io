paper like I was 98 there been many
versions subsequent things that have to
do with important sampling that look at
the particles and stuff here's another
example of doing a head tracking 2002
and you can see it's a little hard white
right there tracking the head there okay
there's an interesting example right
here you see the head here is fully
visible but then it goes behind the
cabinet in fact the only part of the
head that's visible I just outlined in
fact only the top half is visible there
so the question is how did they move
through occlusion okay because part of
the head is missing well maybe they used
velocity in their state or maybe they
didn't what do you think you think they
did or you think they didn't personally
I would have thought they did because I
mean I know all about Kalman filtering I
know if you track velocity it's really
easy but then if I think about particle
filters I say I probably didn't need to
track velocity for the following reason
it's not the case that it has to be a
great example of a head contour it has
to be the case that the example of the
head contour that's here is a better
example than if I put the head somewhere
else and in fact indeed this paper they
tracked the head through the partial
occlusion without velocity now would it
have worked if the head was totally
occluded behind the cabinet no because
then the thing would just stay there in
fact they call it a velocity zero model
the particles just stay where they are
and they just diffuse out from the
uncertainty and so if you showed up on
the other side of the cabinet you'd be
out of the frame of you all together yes
Megan I'm back okay whereas if you did
velocity you would follow me follow me
there you go follow it very very good so
now you get the you get the point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
