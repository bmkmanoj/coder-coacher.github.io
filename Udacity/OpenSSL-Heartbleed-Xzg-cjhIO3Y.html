I indicated that we are writing that we
storing data in some part of memory and
we keep going beyond the limit where we
should stop and so the overflow is a
result of writing stuff all floors don't
just have to be associated with writing
data all floors could also happen
because we read the whole idea here is
that overflow is because we do too much
of something we keep writing beyond the
limit we write more than what we're
supposed to what if you read too much
let's say variable has 12 bytes but you
asked to read hundred bytes what the
reed is going to do is it's going to
keep going beyond the variable and it's
going to go on to the next one and the
one after that and things like that so
wherever in memory you have that
variable that you reading if you go
beyond that you're going to get into
other variables now there's a fairly
well known vulnerability in the openssl
code which is used and all to secure all
kind of online transactions and secure
communications on it was called the
heartbleed vulnerability actually it was
an overflow related vulnerability but it
wasn't writing into the stack beyond the
memory that we had allocated for the
variable into which we are writing it
was actually a read overflow
vulnerability actually this openssl
heartbleed did is that it kept reading
beyond the variable that you're supposed
to read and there were some juicy stuff
beyond that to do with keys and things
like that so if you read too much you're
going to get additional data beyond
what's really should be in this variable
that you're trying to read and so the
additional data that you got could be
used to figure out sensitive keys and
things like that and that's what the
vulnerability was but the wall nobody
comes from the fact that we were reading
beyond the variable that the code was
supposed to access as a result the
overflow occurs while you were reading
you go beyond the boundary of the
variable and keep going so that's called
a read-only buffer overflow and the
example that we just discussed is the
heartbleed vulnerability that occurred
because of that buffer flows don't have
to be on TAC only they can happen on a
heap and buffer overflows don't have to
be just when you write they could also
happen when you read it's just going
beyond the boundary where you should
stop you don't do that that's the
overflow if you're reading some data
then it's read-only buffer overflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
