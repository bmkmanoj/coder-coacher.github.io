an iOS class called nsurl which comes
with a function file URL with pat now it
turns out that this function does
exactly what we wanted to do it takes in
a string and spits out an nsurl now I
can use this variable which is of type
nsurl in step 2 of our pseudocode which
is to create an instance of av audio
player okay I can create a new variable
and call it audio player and then I can
initialize it by calling the constructor
for av audio player and as soon as I
start typing it Xcode gives me some
suggestions let me choose the one which
takes in nsurl as an argument let me hit
enter to accept the suggestion okay so
this value here is the file path URL so
let me replace that an error for now i
will enter as nell alright so the last
thing to do in our pseudocode is to play
the audio to do this I will go back to
the action place low audio remember this
is the function that gets executed when
we press the button with the snail image
on it and in here I will simply say
audio player dot play huh it seems like
there is a bug in our program it says
use of unresolved identify our audio
player can you check to see what's going
on here and help me solve this problem
