the mean think of the mean like a
teeter-totter where should the pivot go
so that it balances these rocks or balls
represent the salaries of the geography
majors now if this were a teeter-totter
where should the pivot go so that it
balances that's basically the mean which
in this data set of the salaries of
geography majors is forty-seven thousand
seven hundred eighteen like you
calculated now if we were to add another
ball say here then the teeter totter
would tip therefore the pivot would have
to move this way so that it keeps
balancing so you can see that all scores
affect the mean you've also seen that
the mean can be described with a formula
we described the sample mean as x-bar
which is the sum of the values divided
by the number of values and the
population mean some of the values
divided by the number in the population
this is also true that many samples from
the same population will have similar
means for now I'll just show you this
applet again where if we pick a sample
of size five we get that the mean is
roughly in the middle and if we do it
again again we get that the mean is
roughly in the middle let's do it a few
more times
now we've calculated 10 simulated means
from this distribution and they're all
roughly similar this is actually a very
important and awesome concept and we're
going to go into this in a lot more
depth later in the course also the mean
of a sample can be used to make
inferences about the population it came
from this relates to this last property
of the mean because you saw that all the
samples are pretty similar and that they
roughly approximated the population mean
it's only the last one that's not a
property of the mean if we bring up the
pivot example again let's say we added a
stone way out here is this gonna change
the mean
you betcha it's gonna have to go to the
left somewhere so that this will still
balance let's explore this point a
little more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
