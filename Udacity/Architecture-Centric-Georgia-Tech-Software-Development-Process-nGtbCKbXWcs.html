is that it is architecture centric as we
saw in the first lesson of this mini
course a software architecture is a view
of the entire system that represents all
high-level principal design decisions
another way to see this is by saying
that use cases define the function of
the system whereas architecture defines
the form of the system use cases give
the functionality architecture tells you
how the system should be structured to
provide that functionality so how do we
define a software architecture in the
rational unified process also in this
case this happens through a sort of a
iterative process we start by creating a
rough outline of the system and in this
case we do it independently from the
functionality so this is just the
general structure of the system for
example we model aspects such as the
platform on which the system will run
the overall style for example whether
it's a client server or a peer-to-peer
system and so on we then use the key use
cases in our use case diagram to define
the main subsystems of my architecture
for example in the case of a banking IT
system one of these subsystems might be
the withdrawal system so what will
happen in that case is that we will have
some use case that refers to the
withdrawal activity and by analyzing
that use case I will realize that we
need a subsystem that implements that is
a functionality so again we use the key
use cases to identify and define the key
subsystems for my architecture so once
we have that we keep refining the
architecture by using additional use
cases so considering more and more
pieces of functionality that will help
us to refine the architecture of the
system and also leveraging our
increasing understanding of the system
that we model and this will continue
until we are happy with the architecture
that we define</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
