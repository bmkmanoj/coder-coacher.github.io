records in all tricks we're going to
start with a data set that has names and
phone numbers in it phone numbers can
move from one person to the next and
data sets can lag in terms of updating
new phone numbers to the right people so
in this data set it would be nice to
know which phone numbers have been
associated with more than one person one
way we can do this is to use the
summarized tool when we add the
summarized tool we highlight the phone
field select add and group by when we
run all tricks we get a unique list of
the phone numbers if we look in the
messages we can see that 14 records were
summarized to 11 groups so we know that
there are duplicates to expose which
phone number has duplicates we can go
back to the summarize tool highlight the
phone field go to add and select count
after we've run the workflow it'll show
the count of the records for each phone
number and which phone numbers are in
the data multiple times if we want to
see the names associated with these
phone numbers we could add this as an
additional field in the summarized tool
by selecting contact add string and
concatenate the result is a list of
names separated by commas if we had
thousands or millions of records and we
wanted to identify the duplicates we may
just want to filter out the duplicates
from the list and review that list to do
that we add the filter tool after the
summarized we select the count field and
say greater than 1 under the true side
is a list where there was the same phone
number for more than one record there's
another way that you can find duplicates
in your data though the unique tool does
exactly this but it pulls through all of
the fields in your data we select the
unique tool from the preparation
category connect it to the input text
and choose the phone number as the field
that we're going to identify duplicates
for run the workflow
on the you side are all the records that
are unique records and on the duplicate
side are the three records that are
duplicates of records on the unique side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
