snooping coherence approaches one was
write update the other is write
invalidate so going back to our
optimized write update setup where we
had the valid and the tag bits also the
dirty bit for right back caches and a
shared bit that tells us whether we are
alone in this a write invalidate
protocol will broadcast rights on the
bus so that they can be seen by
everybody but instead of updating their
copies they will invalidate them so
let's see how this works let's say this
core is a we send this get the value
from memory now we have it as valid not
dirty the tag is a the value is let's
say zero and it's not shared let's say
now we have the right to weigh and write
one to it we have a cache miss we
broadcast the right we now don't need to
broadcast the value with it because the
other caches don't need this value
what's going to happen is as we send
this to the bus it's going to be snooped
by this cache and it sees that somebody
is trying to write to the block that I
have in my cache in a write-update
protocol we would now need the value to
put it here in a write invalidate
protocol all we do is change the valid
bit to zero so now we will miss in the
cache next time we read this particular
cache now gets the valid it's not shared
every time we do a write and broadcast
it we know it's not shared because all
the other copies have been destroyed so
our write makes the block non shared in
the writing processor it is dirty and
now it has a value of one so now a read
of a here in a write-update protocol
would be a hit and just read here but in
a write invalidate protocol the read
will still get the new value it's not
going to be incoherent because it
doesn't get the value of 0 it will now
be a mess and be sent to the bus now the
memory has not been updated yet but the
processor who has the dirty data and
matches the address of the block will
see that there is a read request on the
bus and
spawned with the data so now the block
becomes valid somebody gave us the data
so definitely now it's shared we get the
data and the cache we rewrote now also
knows it's shared because we gave it to
somebody so clearly we are not the only
one who has it anymore
so now note that just like in a
write-update protocol if we have a lot
of reads now they can have cache hits
another write will invalidate this so
there will be a cache miss also so the
disadvantage of write invalidate
protocols is that there is a Miss on all
the readers when somebody writes however
there is an advantage to it as well in
that if you need to update the same
block twice let's say you write to 2a we
invalidate this copy by broadcasting now
the block is no longer shared we put 2
there so we had a broadcast for this
first write if we now do some more reads
and writes they can all be done locally
we don't have to broadcast them so
basically by in validating this copy we
made ourselves be the only one who has
the block and now we don't need to
broadcast all the writes so for anything
where one core works on it for a while
then another one works on it for a while
if the work involves writing only the
first write really has to be broadcast
after that it's a local access put both
reads and writes in contrast with write
update we would have to keep updating
the other cache until it replaces the
block just like we'd write update write
invalidate can benefit from the same
type of optimization when we are writing
to different blocks and accessing it
later
so in that case B is fetch here is not
shared becomes dirty and C is fetch here
is not shared becomes dirty and gets a
value of 1 and now we can have cache
hits on both reads and writes without
going to the bus for B here and we can
access C here with no going to the bus
so for blocks that are only accessed on
one core we have the same behavior for
both write update and write invalidate
but for blocks that are shared we get
different behavior write update tends to
result in more hits
but the
more broadcasts if we repeatedly update
write-invalidate generates a mess on all
the readers after a right occurred but
it allows us to locally right after the
first right note that we'd write update
we ensured for a that the second
property of coherence is maintained by
updating all the copies so when a write
occurs all copies are up-to-date and
thus they will return the new value of
the right we'd write invalidate we
ensure the same property by the right
invalidating all the other copies so da
now they have no choice but to get the
new version of the data
so either way reads will get the new
version of the data but that is achieved
in different ways the third property of
coherence is still insured by snooping
in a right invalidate protocol with
snooping
so basically snooping on the bus still
ensures that any rights that need to go
to the bus because there is sharing will
be ordered by the order to which they go
to the bus so for example a right here
will invalidate everything now a right
here has to put a request on the bus
because it's a mess and thus obtain the
copy from here and now everybody knows
what the order was in fact at any given
time only the last version really
survives in caches because a right
invalidates all the other copies so it's
pretty clear whose version was last
cause all the readers need to get the
copy that was written last anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
