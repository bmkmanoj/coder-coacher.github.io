open the main not story word file and
navigate to our place sounds view
controller scene let's start by changing
the background of the view back to white
select the view in the document outline
and then in the attributes inspector
select white as the background color
okay now to add the stack views in pitch
perfect we're going to have a vertical
stack view as the base with horizontal
stack views embedded inside of it make
sure the object library is open here on
the bottom right and putting the word
stack into the search box you should see
horizontal and vertical stack views drag
a vertical stack view onto the view you
should see it underneath the view in the
document outline here on the left side
drag diagonally from the vertical stack
view back to the view with the shift key
held down select leading space to
container trailing space to container
vertical spacing to top layout guide
vertical spacing to bottom layout guide
and select add constraints this will add
the constraints we need but the stack
view is still the wrong size the reason
is that Xcode has put in constants in
the constraints to keep the stack view
at the size you see here we really
should we move those and make it the
same size as the view to do that go into
each of the four constraints and set the
constant to zero as you do this you'll
notice that the stack view it will start
to look correctly once you finish
setting all the constants 20 the stack
view will be the same size as the view
for our place sounds view controller
let's make sure the main vertical stack
view has the correct fill and
distribution properties select the
vertical stack view from the document
outline in the attributes inspector
choose fill for the alignment and feel
equally for the distribution make sure
spacing is set to 0 as you see here for
this next step Xcode is going to display
a few Auto layout warnings while we drag
the new stack view onto our scene don't
be alarmed the warnings will be there
while the stack view is empty once we
had buttons to it the stack we will know
how to size itself and the outer layer
warnings will disappear from the object
library search for the word stack drag a
horizontal stack view underneath the
vertical stack view select the
horizontal
stack view and then the attributes
inspector make sure alignment is set to
fill and distribution is set to fill
equally in the next step we're going to
add the buttons for slow and fast audio
