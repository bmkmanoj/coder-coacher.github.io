nice page that mentions all the types of
hands and it also gives the percentages
for each hand that is out of all the
possible poker hands what percentage are
a straight flush four of a kind full
house and so on so here's the
percentages we see that about half the
hands don't have anything they're just a
high card with no pairs or anything else
and then 42% are pairs and then less for
each of those and we see the percentages
aligned with the actual poker values
that is the most rare hand the straight
flush is the highest ranking the next
most rare hand four of a kind is the
next highest ranking and the most common
is the least highest so that makes sense
poker is a sensible game from the point
of view of probability now one thing we
can do is see if we can duplicate this
type of table that is can we test our
routines and make sure we've got it
right in that we identify straight
flushes high cards and everything else
the correct number of times so what
we're going to do is come up with a
program that randomly generates decks or
deals from the deck and then checks to
see what kind it is and check to see if
we can reproduce this probability table
so we're gonna look at random deal
percentages and first we're gonna have a
quiz so say we want to deal out a random
number of hands and then count how many
of each type we have and then come up
with that table like we just saw from
Wikipedia and the question is about how
many hands should we deal out to get a
good estimate of the probabilities that
is we're not going to get the exact
estimate but we want to get some
estimates that are close to the right
probabilities and the more we sample the
closer we'll get should we look at about
52 hands about 50,000 hands 700,000
hands or about 52 factorial hands and
then I also want you to answer why so
one per card or do we need about a
thousand per card
so that the random variations are even
out or do we need about 10 for least
common Han needs common ranking or do we
need one for each of the possible
permutations of everything that came out
kin that came out of the deck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
