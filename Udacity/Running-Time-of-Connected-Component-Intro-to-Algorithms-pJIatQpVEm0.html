time of this algorithm so we have some
idea of how efficient it is and again
that's going to involve counting up the
number of primitive steps primitive
statements time that the algorithm takes
when solving a problem we'll assume as
before the n represents the number of
nodes in the graph and E represents the
number of edges and it turns out that
the basic strategy that we use for this
algorithm is a kind of graph search
there's two principal flavors of graphs
graph search depth-first search and
breadth-first search this one that we're
about to talk that we've been talking
about is a form of depth-first search
later we're gonna see a version of
breadth-first search when we start
looking at shortest paths but this
particular algorithm is not concerned
about the length of the past is just
trying to figure out which nodes can be
reached by any kind of path so taking a
look at this algorithm here one of the
things that we can note right off the
bat is statements like this one marked
node equals true can only be executed
once for each node in the graph so even
though it's a little bit hard to tell
exactly when this is going to execute we
know at the end of the day every node is
going to get marked and no more nodes
going to get marked twice so that means
once for each node in the graph we're
going to execute this statement and this
statement and this loop and what is this
loop - it goes through and basically
visits all the edges that come out of
this particular node node and for each
of those edges well it does some work it
checks whether or not it's marked which
we're going to assume is a unit time
operation some kind of nice hash table
and behaves nicely and a recursive call
and we're gonna somehow have to account
for all the stuff that happens in this
recursive call but let's not worry about
that for the moment it's going to do
this one main computation this at this
adding whatever value it gets back to
this quantity here dependent return so
this these statements here are going to
get executed once per node this
statements going to get executed once
per node this statement is going to get
executed once per edge in the graph
because for each node it's going to
visit all the edges emanating from that
node so even though it's very difficult
to keep track of what's going to be
executed
when we know that the total running time
here is going to be big theta of the
number of nodes plus the total number of
edges in the graph so that's what's
happening in this mark component and
then what's happening outside here
there's this marked gets executed once
at all then for every node in the graph
it may or may not execute this statement
which does the call to mark component so
we're going to iterate over all the
nodes and again we're gonna do some work
but not more than constant work per node
and if we look at our running time here
adding another n in here doesn't change
the big theta again even though it's
very complex to figure out which
statements are executing when the actual
running time is big theta of n plus M
it's worth pointing out that this is
linear in the size of the graph right
the graph consists of some number of
nodes and some of our edges and that's
the whole story
so this is actually linear in the in the
size of the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
