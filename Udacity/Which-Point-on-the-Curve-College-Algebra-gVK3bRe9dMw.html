equation we can figure out what points
it corresponds to let's start out by
remembering what this equation is saying
if we look at either side of this
equation we can translate each side into
a point that lies on the graph of an odd
function this is part of the beauty of
using function notation F of negative x
is the Y value of a point and it also
tells us what the x value of that point
is this left side means then that we
have the point negative x comma let's
call it Y for our y-coordinate and the
right side then has X as its
x-coordinate since that's the input and
then its y-coordinate f of x is just the
negative version of this y coordinate
now here's where it gets a little bit
tricky I didn't tell you that either of
these points lies on the graph I told
you that the point X comma Y lies on the
graph what's the difference between this
point and this point though well here we
have negative x and here we have
positive x and here we have positive Y
and negative Y so it looks like for each
coordinate the only thing that has
changed is the sign if we do that to
this point what we get is negative x
comma negative Y so that's your answer
this is another point that lies on the
curve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
