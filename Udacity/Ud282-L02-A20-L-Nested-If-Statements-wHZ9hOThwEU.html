over to see a movie and you're trying to
write a program that will pick a movie
that everyone will like you only like
action movies but you know friend one
only watches movies that have romance in
them and front two only watches movies
that have either comedy or horror given
these four boolean variables that store
whether a movie includes action romance
horror or comedy all true if it does and
false if it doesn't what if statement
can be right to choose a movie that
everyone can enjoy we have to focus on
writing a test condition that involves
all three of our preferences our first
preference is action our second romance
and our third preference is either
comedy or horror and we can combine all
our preferences in one test condition by
using logical operators by separating
all three of our preferences with and
operators that means that all of them
must be true in order for the whole test
condition to be true for our third
preference our friend wanted either
comedy or horror so as long as one of
these is true this whole combination
will also be true but imagine adding
another friend to this list with
complicated preferences these logical
tests can get really long and with lots
of parentheses so they can be hard to
understand and sometimes programmers
choose to use nested if statements
instead nested if statements are just an
if statement within an if statement and
they let you combine multiple test
conditions similar to how an and
operator does so our long if statement
can be written instead as an if within
another if our outer if has its curly
braces surrounding our inner if and our
nested if only contains this block of
code inside its curly braces and this
code performs the same checks as before
our outer if checks if a movie includes
action and romance and our inner if
checks our third preference whether
there's comedy or horror and the nested
if has given us the ability to break up
a long test condition it also lets us
add code that executes inside each if
statement separately with these values
will then look at our decision-making
code line by line we know action and
romance are both true so when they're
combined with an and operator this whole
expression will
also be true so we'll enter the code in
our outer if statement and print out
this movie includes action and romance
the next line we get to is our nested if
statement which checks if comedy or
horror is true and since both of these
are false this expression will also be
false and so we'll skip over the code in
our inner if and all that will print out
is this movie includes action and
romance now let's change our comedy
variable so that it's true this time
we'll still enter our first outer if and
print out this movie includes action and
romance then our inner if checks if
either comedy or horror is true this
time comedy is true so we'll enter our
inner if and also print out this also
includes comedy or horror and our print
output will be those two lines of text
so whether you're checking a complicated
test condition or just want to separate
code nested ifs can be a really useful
