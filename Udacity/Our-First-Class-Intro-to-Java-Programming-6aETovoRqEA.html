the last lesson you've used objects of
classes that other people have created
in this lesson you will learn how to
write your own classes
well started with the class that models
a car that drives along when you design
a class the first thing you ask yourself
is what can one do with the objects well
imagine a car object it can drive being
a car one will need to add gas once in a
while the object should be able to tell
us how many miles it has driven and also
how much gas is left that's all that our
car objects will be able to do now the
first step is to take this English
description off the cars capabilities
and turn it into the Java code for the
public interface here is how I like to
do it I first imagined myself being a
user of this class so I'd have an object
here it's my car
and here's how I might want to call the
add gas method the name of the method
add gas and here I'd add 20 gallons to
make the car drive call the drive method
on the car and of course one has to say
for how long to drive and here we say a
hundred miles and then I might want to
find out how much gas is left in the
tank after that so I again used to my
car object invoke the get gas in tank
method it returns the gas level and I
store that in a variable well what's the
point I now have more information I can
see that these two methods take
arguments and this one doesn't and I can
see that this method here returns a
value and that's actually a number and
these two don't now it's fairly easy to
write up the public interface of the
class I have four methods here you see
the names you see that the first two
methods have parameter variables and you
see that these two methods return values
Betsie more closely and how this process
works look at the add gas method here
here we see it takes an argument there
are a number of gallons added I've
called that here the amount and it's of
type double this method doesn't return
any value so it's declared as a void and
contrast gas get gas in tank has no
arguments so there's no parameter
variable here but it returns a number
we put the keyword double here so the
general process when designing a class
is to first informally figure out what
you want the class to do then to put
yourselves in the shoes of the user of
the class and see how those methods
might be called and then you have enough
information to write up the public
interface in Java Sarah is going to
practice that process with you with
another class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
