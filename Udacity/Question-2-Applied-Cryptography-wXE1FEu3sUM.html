security in the real world she saw an
e-book company that encrypts the e-book
we're using as a key the person's credit
card number to place reliance presumably
on the user to decide whether it's safe
to share it so this sounds like a really
bad idea to me to be embedding personal
information in the ebooks the goal here
is to watermark to have the digital
content specific to each user in a way
that if they distribute copies of it
they put in on a file-sharing site or
they use the copyright in some way that
it can be traced back to them and
there's been quite a bit of work on
using cryptography to make watermarks
especially in videos but also possibly
in books and images you can embed
something that makes each image unique
and it's hard to remove without breaking
the image this is probably much harder
to do for plain text than it is for
video just because you can't really
modify the text but you could do things
that and this gets a little toward
steganography where you're hiding a
message inside something that looks like
an unencrypted document so you could be
doing things where you're varying the
spacing or you're changing things that
don't really affect the content or in
the embedded information in the e-book
that you don't actually see when you
read it you could be hiding some extra
information which could embed the
identity of the person who bought the
book that would be potentially possibly
easy to strip out so that's something
that you need to worry about if you want
to use a watermark in this case it seems
like it's really improper way to treat
the customers if they're not knowing
this is happening and it's especially if
it's their credit card information that
could be used in a way that's abusing
the user but there are legitimate
reasons to want to do watermarking of
digital content like this and
cryptography provides a great way to do
it and the challenge if you're doing it
for something like video is you can do a
lot of things to modify the video that
might get rid of the watermark so simple
things like using the lowest bits in
each pixel to encode the watermark well
those are really easy to remove because
you can change all the lowest bits and
the pixels without changing what the
video looks like
so there are lots of clever schemes that
try to do things that are hard to remove
like changing the timing of black
screens between scenes and doing things
that are more pervasive in the whole
image but still don't make the content
broken so there are lots of social
issues here about whether you can
secretly track people and whether that
should be illegal or encouraged or what
kind of authorisation you need to do
that and then there they're interesting
crypto issues of if it seems acceptable
to do this in some context like when
Hollywood studios disturbing a movie in
previews they have a pretty good reason
and good understanding with the people
they distribute to that they want to
keep close track on it and find out if
anyone's leaking copies early to put a
watermark in those things to find a way
to do that cryptographically that can't
be easily removed and doesn't damage
that the content in ways that are
noticeable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
