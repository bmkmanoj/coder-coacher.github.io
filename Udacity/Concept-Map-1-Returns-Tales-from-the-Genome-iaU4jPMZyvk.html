provides genetic instructions for trades
and both of these can be influenced by
the environment genome is actually made
of DNA which we'll learn more about in
lesson 2 a genome is inherited as
individual units we mentioned they're
called genes which we'll learn about in
a future lesson and traits were also
inherited both traits and genomes are
inherited from parents and from parents
they're passed on to children traits can
be categorized as either hidden or
visible physical or behavioral and
innate or learned there can be many
variants of any given trait and
generally they're separated into two
categories is either being preferred or
good traits or undesired or bad traits
now obviously these words are relative
to each other and they can have
different meanings depending on who you
ask usually we reserve the term
undesired or bad only for traits that
cause or variants of traits that cause
sickness or death also remember that
traits are inherited and they can skip
generations they can appear undiluted
but they can also blend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
