haven't done this before so you'll
probably want to go to the documentation
page to figure out how to do this here's
the question suppose now that I've done
my fitting with my lasso regression
maybe I've predicted a point or two with
it let's say that I want to understand
the effect of the fact that this is a
regularizer aggression which means that
I want to look at the coefficients of
the regression I want to see for example
if it's setting any of them to two zero
or two very small values which is
effectively the same as discarding those
features in other words I want to start
accessing the information of which
features are the most important in my
regression result so the question for
you is what would you put in this box
here to print the coefficients of the
regression so I've already given you the
print command and the question is what
line would you put in this box to access
the coefficients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
