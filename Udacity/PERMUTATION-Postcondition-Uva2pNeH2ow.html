permutation is a little tricky here's
one answer that is worth studying to
ensure yourself that you have truly
understand how a formal specification
might look we will break down the
specification of permutation into
several different special cases okay and
this is a typical approach for tricky
specifications or even for tricky
programs is to break them down into
special cases and handle each one of
those special cases by itself okay the
first case to look at is when both
vectors are empty we already know that
the lengths are the same so if we say we
can check whether they're empty by just
checking whether the length of the
vector x equals 0 and in that case we've
already talked about this weeks we will
say that they have the same well now we
didn't talk about we talked about it
with with ordered so if we have an empty
vector and we know that the lengths are
the same that's saying we're going to
have an empty vector is output is that
output vector of permutation on the
input vector it is okay so special case
number one the length of the input
vector is zero we will say in fact that
the output is a permutation of the input</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
