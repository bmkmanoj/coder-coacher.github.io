similar to their immediate family
because they're most related to them
more distant family members still show
similarities but fewer similarities than
the closely related family for example
you might compare yourself to one of
your parents say your mother and you
might be looking at traits that you
share in common and then we could look
at your mother's parents one of her
parents let's say her father your
granddaddy and we could essentially
compare the same traits among all of us
and we can keep going back in time
looking at the parents of the
grandparents and the parents of the
great grandparents and the parents are
the great-great grandparents and we
could just keep going back in this very
linear fashion in general you're
probably going to find that you're most
similar to your parent and then your
grandparent and then your great
grandparent as a general rule but
looking at families in this very linear
fashion isn't really all that accurate
and it's really difficult to make
comparisons to all the other family
members that you're related to your
family actually resembles much more of a
shrub like structure with branches
coming off to the sides up and to the
right all around going back in time in
many different directions we can
represent half siblings aunts uncles
granddad's uncles cousins and so on
let's actually try to look at this
starting with your most immediate
biological family members your parents
father mother and your siblings sister
or brother now you share 100 percent
similarity with yourself congratulations
you are you and with all of these other
immediate family members father mother
sister brother you're sharing about 50%
similarity
this tier of relatedness is the closest
tier of relatedness to you
with regards to your family members
those people with whom you're
genetically related now let's have the
first tier of complexity here your
mother and father may have siblings
these would be considered your aunts and
uncles your aunts and uncles and your
parents all share parents themselves
your grandparents this tier of
relatedness is roughly 25% to you this
tier also includes relatives like half
siblings half sibling is someone who
shares one biological parent
you now you notice that when we added
one tier of complexity we got a lot
bigger pretty fast right we added a
bunch of levels both in the same
generation as you the generation above
you and another generation beyond that
now we can add another tier and keep
building your family tree or your family
shrub in this case we've added many more
great-grandparents some grand aunts and
grand uncle's some first cousins here
and we can keep building and keep
building this tree or shrub or as I like
to think of it a family rainbow and we
can start at the center here with
perfect genetic relatedness and keep
moving out to the next rung to the next
part of the rainbow and we get less and
less related and as we build we just get
bigger and bigger our family stretches
on and on in many directions we're
including great-great grandparents
second cousins first cousins once
removed this visual really brings to
light the shrub enos of our families and
our family trees now with a visual like
this which of the following inferences
is the least well described would it be
family relatedness genetic relatedness
or trait relatedness go ahead and pick
the answer you think best applies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
