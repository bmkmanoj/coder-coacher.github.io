that a spine data center should keep in
mind is that they they should have a
very curious mind they should have the
ability to ask questions to kind of
formulate these questions as it pertains
to them as they would see these
questions being raised in their own
lives so if there is a problem they see
with the with the business that they
were working with orbital again with the
project that they were working with they
should they should try to they should
try to ask these questions in terms of
how they can understand it for
themselves and once they understand what
was they know what is the the the gist
of the question is then there you can go
and use algorithms of this it helps
tremendously if you know if you have
experience about all the algorithms that
are out there to attack these questions
I think the most important ability that
you should have as a data scientist and
you you will obviously improve
throughout your your career in this is
that you have this this inclusive
mindset where you are trying to ask the
right questions where you are trying to
see what is important and you also have
an overview of what kind of data can
support in the end your conclusions that
you are going to draw draw with the help
of these algorithms that you are going
to use to solve this problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
