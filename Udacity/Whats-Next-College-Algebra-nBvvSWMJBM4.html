help us though eventually you want to
get f of X in its fully factored form
but what we do with this single factor
that we already know to find out the
other factors well let's think if we
have a number like 12 and we know that 2
is a factor of it then if we divide 12
by two we get 6 as what we need to
multiply by 2 to get 12 some means that
all the other factors must multiply to
equal 6 then we can also factor 6 into 2
and 3 those are the other two prime
factors of 12 so now we have the full
prime factorization of 12 is just equal
to two x two x three so it looks like if
we divide a number by a factor that's
known let me get a simplified number in
this case or expression in this case
that is a product of the leftover
factors are still looking for that means
that we should divide this expression by
X minus 2 to get one step closer to
figure out our other factors but how do
we do this well you'll have to wait for
the next lesson to find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
