course into eight major units this chart
illustrates those eight units so
starting from the top left the first
unit has to do with fundamentals of
representation and reasoning planning
common-sense reasoning analogical
reasoning metacognition that we just
talked a little bit about design and
creativity visual spatial reasoning and
learning let us look at each of these
circles one at a time so in the first
part dealing with the fundamentals of
this course we'll be dealing with
certain knowledge representations and
reasoning strategies two of the major
knowledge representations that we'll
discuss in the first part of this course
are called semantic networks and
production systems three of the
reasoning strategies are called
generating test mean since analysis and
problem reduction note that the arrows
here imply an ordering there is an
ordering in that when we are discussing
our production systems we might allude
to things that we discussed in the
semantic networks similarly when we
discussed means and analysis we might
allude to things that we discussed in
generating tests however it is important
to note also that these three methods
are completely independent from each
other it's just that be it greater
discuss them in the order shown here
similarly these two knowledge
representations are independent from
each other it's simply that in this
course we'll discuss them in this order
so the second major unit in this course
pertains to planning planning is a kind
of problem-solving activity whose goal
is to come up with plans for achieving
one or more goals before we discuss
planning will discuss logic as a
knowledge representation this knowledge
representation would then enable us to
discuss planning in a systematic way the
third major unit in this course is
common sense reasoning common sense
reasoning pertains to reasoning about
everyday situations in the world as an
example I may give you the input John
gave the book to Mary note the input
does not specify who has the book at the
end but you can draw that inference
easily there is an example of common
sense
an abacus will discuss both knowledge
representations like frames as well as
methods for doing common-sense reasoning
as we discussed earlier when we were
talking about the architecture of a
Carnot system learning is a fundamental
process within deliberation and
therefore we will be visiting the issue
of learning many many times throughout
this course however we also have a unit
on learning which has several topics in
it there are other topics in learning
they do not show up in this particular
circle here but are distributed
throughout the course another major unit
in our course is analogical reasoning
analogical reasoning is reasoning about
novel problems or novel situations by
analogy to what we know about family of
problems of family of situations as I
mentioned earlier learning is
distributed throughout this course
therefore learning comes here an
analogical reasoning also in fact
learning by recording cases appeared in
the learning topic as well as here and
you can see explanation based learning
occurring here visual spatial reasoning
is another major unit ANOVA course
visual spacial reasoning pertains to
reasoning with visual knowledge as an
example I may draw a diagram and reason
with the diagram that's an example of
visual spatial reasoning and the context
of visual spatial reasoning
we're talking both about constraint
propagation and using that to do a
visual spatial reasoning design and
creativity is the next topic in our
course we want to build AI systems that
can deal with novel situations and come
up with creative solutions design is an
example of a complex task which can be
very very creative we'll be discussing a
range of topics in the context of design
and creativity so the next topic in our
course is metacognition we have already
come across the notion of metacognition
when we were talking about the
architecture of the cognitive system
metacognition pertains to thinking about
thinking and we'll discuss a range of
topics in them and we'll end the course
by talking about ethics in artificial
intelligence this figure illustrates all
the eight major units once again as well
as the topics within each major unit I
hope this will give you
mental map of the organization of the
course of the whole in preparing this
course we came up with the ordering of
the topics which will interleave many of
these topics so we will not do the
entire first unit before we go to the
second unit and so on instead we'll do
some parts of us in it then go to some
other part that follows conceptually
from it and so there'll be some
interleaving among these topics and one
aspect of the personalization is that
you're welcome to go through these
topics in your own chosen order you
don't have to stay with the kind of
order that we'll be using this is an
exciting agenda I hope you are as
excited about it as I am there are very
few opportunities where we can talk
about exotic topics like analogical
reasoning and creativity and
metacognition and in this particular
course we'll talk about all of them
together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
