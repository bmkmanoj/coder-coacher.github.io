see the whole star we need to set the
cameras viewport size so here we've set
both the width and height of the
viewport to be double the radius so the
star should fit comfortably within our
camera note the distinction between
these two lines the set to ortho call
tells the camera how big a window we're
using to look at the world the viewport
size is how much of the world were
looking at then we set the cameras
position to be the center of the star
let's see what it looks like
oh the Stars all stretched out let's see
if we can figure out why this happened
ah so we set the viewport width and
height to be equal but our window
doesn't have equal width and height it's
wider than it is tall anticipating this
occurrence we already calculated the
aspect ratio of the window up here now
we can just set the cameras viewport
width to be the aspect ratio times if
you port height let's try it now much
better
I thought stars were supposed to be
circles let's actually do one more thing
and nudge our camera to the right a
little bit and now we can see both the
entire star and the EDD planet next to
it
let's try zooming in on this planet next
so we've set the viewport height to be
double the planet radius so the window
should just contain the planet then we
set the viewport width to be the aspect
ratio times the viewport height that way
the planet stays a circle finally we
just set the position of the camera to
be the center of the planet and there we
go we've apparently got a very heavily
forested planet or something all right
let's do this one more time this time
with the satellite so setting the
viewport height and width should be
pretty familiar and then we set the
position let's see what we've got so far
cool so we've located the satellite out
in space but looks like the satellite is
rotating as it orbits or something like
that let's match the rotation of our
camera to the rotation of the satellite
so here we go the satellite rotation is
contained in this constant and then
camera rotate will rotate the camera by
that number of degrees counter clockwise
let's give it a try awesome
docking ports aligned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
