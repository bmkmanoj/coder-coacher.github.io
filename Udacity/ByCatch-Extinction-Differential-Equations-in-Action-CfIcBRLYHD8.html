in this situation we're going to pretend
that we are fishermen and we're
interested in catching this red type of
fish right here however whenever we try
to catch the red fish we also end up
catching a bunch of these smaller green
fish as you can see from the contents of
our net right here what we're going to
do in this problem is model logistic
growth for both species of fish the red
in the green with the constants and the
initial values that we've already
included in the supplied code just a
reference i've included a general
equation for logistic growth right here
f is the population that we're looking
at r is the growth rate of the
population and see is the carrying
capacity of the surrounding environment
now remember when we model the change in
population for both types of fish we
need to include both population growth
which is dictated by this equation but
also the harvesting rate we've created
this parameter called P to represent the
fraction of the total fish that we catch
that are part of the green fish
population so we might also call this
the fraction of the bycatch just to
start we've inserted a value of 0 point
5 for P what you're going to do is
calculate the threshold value of P for
fish to to not go extinct in other words
what is the highest possible value of P
that will allow for an equilibrium
situation in the population of fish too
after you've calculated the correct
value of P come down to the for loop and
use as you've done so many times before
the forward Euler method you'll notice
that we've already included a line for
you to prevent the population of either
type of fish from becoming negative good
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
