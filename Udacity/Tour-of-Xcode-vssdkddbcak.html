pitch-perfect
app I'm going to go over some of the
basic parts of Xcode and we'll be diving
into the code in just a moment on the
left side you can see the Navigator
panels starting with the project
navigator on the middle is the content
area and it's currently showing the
settings for a pitch-perfect project on
the right side you have the utility area
with inspector panels with the file
inspector panel currently open on the
bottom you can see the debug and console
windows
unlike other ide s and editors you may
have used in the past xcode requires
only a single click to select a file or
an item starting with a navigator pen on
the left there are many different ways
to view the files and other parts of
your project
there are even ways to move through
these panels with just the keyboard as
an example you can use command 0 to
toggle the navigators panel on and off
if like me you need to find more screen
space from time to time on the right
side we have the inspectors panel and
the number available depends on the
content or item you have selected in the
case of this project setting we can see
file and quick help inspectors as you
progress with your app you'll be able to
see other inspectors much like the
navigator panels you can toggle the
inspector panels by using keyboard
shortcuts to move through them this is
especially useful if you're in need of
more space to view your content at
udacity we have a saying that content is
king and with Xcode that is also true
the code and even user interface in
storyboards are always in the center
view here in the prime spot in the
content editor on the bottom right we
have the library and at the very bottom
of the screen you can see the debug and
console panels the console panel is
where you see the hello world printed
the Xcode content editor is where you're
going to spend a lot of your time as an
iOS developer it can adapt to help you
edit any part of your project from
project settings to code to user
interface elements knowing that the
editor is contact sensitive can help a
lot when you're looking for how to
change a particular setting
Xcode with a pitch-perfect project which
is a little blue icon here on the top of
the project navigator we can see the
settings for the entire project we can
see the version that iOS is targeting
and we can see that the interface file
is called main four main storyboard we
can also use this to decide what
orientations to support and to launch in
here you can see we're supporting the
portrait orientation as well as
landscape left and landscape right if we
select the app delegate Swift file we
can see that the Xcode editor panel
changes to let us modify the Swift
source code you can see that Xcode
automatically highlights the code to
make it easier to read remember that
main storyboard selection back in the
project settings that's referring to
this file main that storyboard if you
select it in a project Navigator with a
single click the X code editor changes
to show you the user interface for this
application you can use two finger pinch
to zoom out of it so you can see the
entire thing this is the view where
we're going to use to set up any UI
elements for our iOS apps including
pitch perfect I know it may seem like a
lot but we'll walk you through step by
step and touch every part of Xcode by
the time you've completed this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
