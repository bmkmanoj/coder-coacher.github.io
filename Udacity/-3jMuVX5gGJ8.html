lot of similarities so that we can see
how prototype chains might help us on
the right here I'll show a picture of
the objects that we're creating as we go
and the relationships that they develop
here we have a property lookup on the
gold object let's consider every step of
what happens when we do a property
lookup for the key a on this object
the interpreter kicks off an
investigation as to whether or not the
gold object has the property we're
looking for upon inspecting the object
the interpreter can tell that there is a
pair available in this object that has
the key a the value that's associated
with that pair is one and so the result
of this lookup expression is going to be
one in this case our logging system
would log the value one out to the
screen somewhere my code assumes that
there's some function called log that
already exists in most environments you
would call it console dot log but let's
take a look at what happens when we ask
for a property that we know the object
doesn't have first that property lookup
arrives at the object and then the
interpreter acknowledges the failure by
providing undefined in response to this
attempted lookup for Z and so the lookup
for Z on the gold object results in
undefined which is what ultimately gets
logged to the screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
