on the right I made a very simple chart
to try and explain how Fibonacci behaves
to myself we're gonna use this same sort
of chart to make Fibonacci much faster
by avoiding repeating a lot of work and
now our official plan for this is going
to be called memo-ization it's just like
memorization but missing an R and here
I've tried to draw two memos a corporate
memo and those yellow sticky notes you
sometimes see where you could write a
little memo to yourself a memo in
English is just a document a small
document that's written down memorandum
why bother with this well it's gonna
turn out that our current implementation
of Fibonacci is super slow let me try to
prove that to you so let's see how long
it takes to do a hundred trials of the
20th Fibonacci number about 0.3 seconds
let's up that a bit to the 24th
Fibonacci number should take not that
much longer right Oh significantly
longer from point three seconds to 1.75
seconds we went up a huge amount let's
go up to the twenty-fifth Fibonacci
number oh we almost doubled we're now at
about 2.8 seconds and in fact we have a
reason to believe based on human studies
that if a webpage takes longer than six
seconds to get back to you you go
somewhere else and buy something
different online so we're already using
up a huge fraction of that budget just
to compute the 25th of a nachi number
and if you think about those trees I
drew before this is unsurprising if we
increase the number by one we almost
double the work at each step so this is
untenable
we need something faster our solution
will be to write it down in a chart or a
little memo to ourselves I'll just make
a table mapping n to the value of
Fibonacci of n 1 1 2 3 5 8 and when I'm
going to figure these out I don't have
to do a huge amount of work let's say
I'm trying to figure out the 6th
Fibonacci number I can just look back in
the table and reuse my old work I don't
need to recompute the 5th of nachi
number I'll
have it here just add those two charts
cells together and get the answer this
is gonna be our trick for making
Fibonacci so much faster
it's called memoization so we can
implement our chart as a Python
dictionary just filling in the numbers
as we compute them so I can make an
empty dictionary assign mappings to my
dictionary and then check to see if
something like 6 is recorded in my chart
and if it is print out the result and
this is going to be super necessary now
and maybe it wasn't before one of the
keys to memorization is looking to see
if you've already done the work and
written it down if you have great you
can just reuse it but if you haven't
you're going to have to go and compute
it manually
