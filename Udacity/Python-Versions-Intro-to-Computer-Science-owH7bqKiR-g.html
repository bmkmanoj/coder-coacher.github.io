Python 2 in this class but Python 3
exists are we is what we're learning
outdated does it not help us in the real
world
ok so fair enough question there there
is a newer version of Python and almost
everything that we've learned in this
class it doesn't matter whether using
Python or JavaScript or scheme or C or
Java any programming language the basic
concepts that we've learned really apply
to all of those languages in the same
way now developing skills as a
programmer is useful to learn different
languages and different languages have
slightly different ways of doing things
and we talked in the previous question
about the pythonic way being the best
way to do something in Python to really
take advantage of the design and the
style that the Python programmers to
expect Python 3 is different from Python
2 and in some ways it's not that
different so almost everything that
you've written in this class would work
in Python 3 and would be the same way to
write it in Python 3 some things would
and most code today's Python 2 is still
used more widely than Python 3 there's
some incompatibilities in Python 3 that
mean it's very hard to move libraries
that were written for Python 2 to work
in Python 3 and the infrastructure that
we're using is all working in Python 2
not in Python 3 so that's the real
reason that we use Python 2 for this
class instead of Python 3 but
essentially everything that you've
learned would be the same would be very
easy to transfer if you start writing
Python 3 code some things will be a
little different probably the most
notable thing that would be different is
print would work differently so the code
that you've written that uses print
would not work in Python 3 you'd have to
add extra parentheses around it but
otherwise everything would really be the
same there's no concepts that would be
different it's just a matter of
different things defined slightly
differently in different languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
