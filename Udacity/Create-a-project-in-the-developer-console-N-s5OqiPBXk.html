account it's time to create a new
project using the create project button
enter the human-friendly name for your
application I'm just going to call it my
first map then you enter the project ID
this ID needs to be unique across all of
googles infrastructure so you'll need to
get specific here as you can see I've
just called it audacity first map one
because this isn't taken and it's
available then you select the billing
account that you're going to use and if
you remember when you're setting up the
billing account you gave a profile name
and I have a profile that I called my
cloud project and I'm just billing based
off of that then you just click create
as you can see it will take a few
moments creating but when it's done
you'll be taken to the project dashboard
now you can see I'm on the project
dashboard so the first thing that I want
to do to enable maps is to go to api's
and off then select a pis and here's a
number of api's that are available to me
but we can see there are Google Maps API
is here so I'm going to go to the Google
Maps Android API and I'm going to enable
it now that it's enabled the final step
is to set up the credentials over here I
can click on the credentials link and
then under public API access I'll create
a new key when it asks what type of key
I'm going to select Android key because
I'm building an Android app it will give
me a dialog asking me for the sha-1 that
I got earlier followed by the name of my
app because I'm not deploying this app
or doing anything with it that would
require the certificates to check if the
restrictions are much looser and one of
these is that the name doesn't really
matter but I am going to use the fully
qualified name of my app the SHA
fingerprint is what we got in terminal
earlier on let's take a look at that
here you can see my sha-1 key so I'm
just going to copy all of that and then
I'm going to put a semicolon and after
the semicolon I'm gonna put the name of
my app in this case it's comm dot Google
dev plats dot L Maroney dot first map
don't worry if you need to change the
name you can do this later with the edit
allowed Android applications button but
I'll just create for now and we can see
that my key is listed here and if I
wanted to change my name I just
edit allowed Android applications and I
can go ahead and change the name the API
key is listed at the top and make a copy
of that or keep the console open because
you'll be needing that in the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
