problem-solving framework that we
started with
now that we've performed the analysis
and run the linear regression model we
need to validate the results of the
model in other words is there a way to
measure how good the model is or in this
case is the linear expression we
calculated a good fit of our data using
the corral function we can calculate the
correlation coefficient of the data set
or the variable R the range of R is from
minus 1 to plus 1 The Closer R is the
plus or minus 1 the better correlation
between x and y to learn more about
correlation coefficients see the link in
the resources below in our example the
value of R is zero point nine eight
seven indicating a strong correlation
while a strong correlation is good we
really want to know how well the data
fits our line fortunately we can get a
sense of how good the formulas at
approximating the data by calculating
the coefficient of determination or R
squared R squared is the coefficient
between 0 and 1 R squared is interpreted
as the percent of variance in
observations that is explained by the
model in our squared value close to 1
would mean that nearly all variance in
the target variable is explained by the
model and our squared value close to 0
would mean that nearly none of the
variance in the target variable is
explained by the model in our squared
value greater than 0.7 is considered to
be a strong model in practice and our
squared value of 0.5 or greater is
usually pretty good in our squared value
less than 0.3 is generally agreed to not
be useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
