systems for different aspects of
monitoring this is a really vast subject
so we can't really cover all of it a
couple of important points one you won't
be able to monitor every aspect of your
system with only a single tool that's
okay pick a couple it's important though
that whatever monitoring systems you
pick be generally accessible within your
organization so that other people can
learn from them as well one of the most
flexible approaches to monitoring
involves having some kind of key value
data store with a simple API to dump in
whatever values you want to monitor this
is the approach favored by graphite in
flux DB etc then you have various front
ends to visualize the data
graphite offers its own web front-end
for its data graph ona
also works well for a more flexible
display and there are a lot of other
systems that are mentioned in the
instructor notes now for the app server
you've been working with in this class
we've provided a graphite monitoring
server with symmetric setup you should
check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
