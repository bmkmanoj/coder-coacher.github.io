time on the beginning and a lot of time
on now spam prevention do you think on a
site like Reddit where it's like the
Wild West there's no rules like anybody
can submit anything that'll just quickly
be over on us you'd be surprised now
that red it's big yes the reddit
receives lots of spam but at the time
you kind of if you understand spammers
motivations it's really easy to prevent
a spammers motivation is basically if
they want links but an easy way to
prevent their links from providing any
value is to add an attribute to your
anchor tag that looks like this so if
you have a link with this extra
attribute rel equals nofollow basically
tells google this link shouldn't be
followed for search quality purposes
because the way Google works right is it
looks at a given page and however many
pages else run Internet link to that
page gives that page some authority and
you can basically say I don't wanna give
this link any authority and so every
link on reddit has rel equals nofollow
until it has a certain number of points
because we didn't want to put rel
nofollow on all links because we like
the way the internet works and we
figured if a link was good on reddit
that link should have some Authority
understanding that spammers are all they
really want our links that to increase
the authority of their page to get more
traffic there really helps so this is
one thing we did another thing we did
was spam is really submitted by an
individual by hand
those almost almost always automated
tools looking at the behaviors of these
bots that were submitting contents to
Reddit they always had these kind of
gaps behavior gaps that humans would
never do for example a bunch of users
who all used the same password before we
were hashing passwords it was really
easy for us to tell they're all using
the same passwords if there was a
hundred users all submitting crap but
they had the same password it was all
spam and we could just remove it and
that worked out really nice eventually
we started you know hashing passwords
and we lost that ability but we had
learned some other tricks along the way
one is that the users didn't understand
the site they would always submit a link
and then comment on their own link and
users legitimate users rarely kampf it
on their own link as the first comment
so we would just look for links that had
one comment by the same author and
market as spam BAM errs on a community
set that behaves differently from other
sites online noticing that these people
use the site in weird ways was enough to
catch the most spam we didn't have to do
any fancy like look for Viagra or look
for suspicious-looking links a lot of
these behavior sticks worked really
really well
submission rate this is another euro
stick legitimate users didn't submit
that often or if they did that the time
between submissions was stagnated and
spammers would often just submit a bunch
of links at the same time we look for
those signs and ban the links most
important thing that read it did and
still does don't let them know when
they're caught when we banish mission on
reddit that user would still see their
submission on our hot page or on their
use
Paige if their vote doesn't count it
would still look like a count and if you
try to figure out on Reddit whether your
vote counts or not it's really difficult
to tell because unread if there's a
delay between when you click that button
and when we update the score I'm not
going to get into the details but
suffice to say it's really really hard
and we've done this we spend a lot of
time making it so that users don't know
in the car and I've had to do this on
ASCII Chan and on my blog as well
because a lot of you guys have submitted
a bunch of crap to ASCII Chan and my
blog that I didn't want to appear a lot
of that stuff is just sitting in
memcache and only you see it but if you
were to change computers you would find
that that submission disappears I think
being subtle about when you've detected
that somebody's spamming is really
really important it's not the only
solution but security through obscurity
works really really well if you keep
things obscure enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
