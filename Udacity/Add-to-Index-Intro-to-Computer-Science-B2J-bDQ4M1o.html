structure hopefully it'll be easy to
write the code for building our index
and I think you actually know enough to
be able to write the procedure that adds
a new entry to the index so your goal
for this quiz is it a final procedure
we'll call it add to index and it takes
three inputs the first input is the
index that we want to add the new
keyword and URL to remember that we
decided and the previous question that
the way to represent the index is as a
list where each element of the list is
itself a list and each of the element
lists is a keyword followed by a list of
the URLs where that keyword appears the
second input is a keyword that's just a
string that's the word that we want to
add to the index and the third input is
the URL which is a string that encodes
the URL where that keyword appears so
what add to index should do depends on
whether or not the keyword that's passed
in is already in the index if the
keyword is in the index we don't want to
create a new entry in index for that
keyword we only want to have that
keyword appear once what we want to do
instead is add the URL to the list of
URLs associated with that keyword so if
the keyword is not in the index what we
need to do is add a new entry to the
index and that new entry will be a list
with the keyword that's the new keyword
and the list of URLs where that keyword
appears this is the first one since it
wasn't already an index so it'll be a
list containing just one URL that's the
list that we want to add to the index to
represent that we found this keyword at
this one URL so far so let's work
through an example suppose we start by
initializing index to the empty list
we have no entries in our index yet then
we'll call add to index adding a new
keyword passing an index as the first
input for the second input we need a
keyword let's use the keyword Udacity
and for the third input we need the URL
where that keyword appears so here's
what we should have so first we create
index we're initializing it as an empty
list we don't have any elements yet then
after we call add index we're going to
add an element to the index list so
we've mutated index now it contains a
single element that element is a list
containing the string Udacity as the
keyword the second element of that list
is itself a list containing one element
which is the string HTTP colon
udacity.com
so that's the new value of index so if
we call add to index again this time
we're passing in index again it's the
value that index refers to which is now
this structure now the keyword is
computing and we're passing in as the
URL ACM org so that's going to mutate
index again we're going to follow the
rule here the keyword is not in the
index so we should add a new entry that
means we're going to append a new entry
to index and that new entry is going to
have the keyword computing as the second
element we have a list and this list
will contain the URL we passed in which
is ACM org so I'm going to show you one
more example in this case we're gonna
pass in a keyword that is already in the
index we're calling add to index again
passing in the keyword Udacity which is
already in the index here and passing in
a new URL which is not in the index so
what should happen this time we're gonna
mutate index but instead of creating a
new element we're gonna mutate the
element that we already have we're going
to look for the entry that matches
Udacity it's already in the index so we
don't want to add a new one what we're
doing is following the first rule here
that says if the keyword is already in
index what we want to do is add the new
URL to the list of URLs associated with
that keyword but we don't want to add
any new entries to the index itself so
here's what that will look like we're
adding to the list of URLs a new entry
that's the new value of the URL so I
hope it's clear now what add to index
should do and I think you know enough to
be able to define it yourself
so that's the goal for this quiz for you
to define the procedure add to index
that has this behavior it takes the
three inputs and it adds a new keyword
to the index</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
