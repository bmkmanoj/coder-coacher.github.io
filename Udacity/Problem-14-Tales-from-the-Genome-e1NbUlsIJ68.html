last problem deschenes muscular
dystrophy so we know that it's x-linked
and it normally only affects males and
here you are we're assuming you're
female but this time we're going to draw
your mother and father and your mother's
brother is affected by muscular
dystrophy so he has the affected X minus
y so what's the probability that you've
received the allele from her let's draw
our pedigree a little bit more and we'll
see here that to have an affected son
here we must have gotten the allele from
one of the parents and since we're not
assuming anyone else in the family
pedigree has been affected the father is
likely to be unaffected so the plus
allele here and that means the allele
probably came from the mother who had
two copies one of the normal and want to
be affected alleles or one of the
unaffected and want to be affected
alleles and she was unaffected so the
probability for passing this down to her
daughter is about one half right she can
either pass down the unaffected allele
or the affected allele so one half is
the probability that your mother
received this allele so assuming that
she got that allele and she is
heterozygous for the affected and
unaffected then what the probability
she'll pass that down to you well again
that's a probability because you're
female right she can pass 1x or the
other of one-half and so one half times
one half is equal to one-fourth or
twenty-five percent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
