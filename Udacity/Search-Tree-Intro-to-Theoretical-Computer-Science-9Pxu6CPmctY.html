the algorithm actually we go we can make
Alice a little bit more happy because
we're soon going to show her that we're
not gonna make her totally happy but at
least neutral because we're now going to
show her a better technique than brute
force and that better technique is known
as a search tree and you will soon see
why it's called a tree so if you were
solving vertex cover by yourself you
would probably take the following
approach you would not say for all
vertices together if they are in the
vertex cover or not but rather you would
look at a single vertex say this one
here and then split into two
possibilities in one you're going to say
yes let's make this vertex part of the
vertex cover and the other one you would
say no I do not want this vertex to be
part of the vertex cover and then you're
going to split down further so on this
side here and on this side here so let's
look at this vertex here next we're just
going to draw it a little bit smaller so
that we don't run out of space so we
already know that this vertex here is in
the vertex cover and we're now deciding
for this vertex here on the left so
we'll have one case where we do put it
into the vertex cover and another one
where we don't put it into the vertex
cover and then for each of these cases
again we can split into two
possibilities and this time we're going
to look at the vertex down here same
here so one case where we put it into
the vertex cover and another case where
we don't now here for this case already
we can stop we have found a solution of
size three all edges are covered we do
not even even need to consider the
possibilities for this vertex here over
here we still have to consider two
possibilities so we still need to make a
decision here on the right side so we
can either put it into the vertex cover
or not put it into the vertex cover and
so the solution here or it's not a
solution because it's not valid and here
again we have found a solution of size
three or a vertex cover of size three so
I'm just going to leave this check mark
here and have this count for both so now
we still have to continue here for these
four points where we left off earlier
and again we're going to do the same
thing so we're going to consider one
possibility where this vertex down here
is not in the vertex cover and again we
see whoops this is invalid so we do not
need to continue any further next time
we're going to put this vertex into the
vertex cover and yes we have a valid
solution of size two
over here we're going to consider this
vertex here again so one possibility
would be to not put it into the vertex
cover but that is already invalid and
another one would be to put it into the
vertex cover which again leaves us two
further possibilities to check and we're
going to trick them follow this one down
here so same game invalid solution over
here still valid over here and need to
consider two more cases and you already
know that this case here is going to be
invalid and over here we're finding a
solution of size three so that's not bad
originally we had with brute force 16
assignments of ceará and went to the
vertices that we needed to check and now
this algorithm here only considered nine
assignments so I told you at the
beginning of this course that constant
factor speedups probably don't matter
that much when we're dealing with
exponential time algorithms so we will
have to do some further analysis on this
one and you also notice that there could
be certain other techniques that we can
use for speed-up so for example here we
had already found a solution of size two
so we probably could have even stopped
our algorithm a little bit earlier over
here but we're going to get into this
the main thing that I would like you to
understand is the technique of the
search tree and we're now going to
analyze this search tree further and try
to improve it and of course I should
also tell you why it is called a search
tree and to show you this draw lines
along where the algorithm was searching
and then we're going to rotate this
picture by 180 degrees and now here you
can see a beautiful tree with the
solution as a Leafs or the fruit or
whatever you will but this is why it's
called a search tree it's basically a
tree that hangs upside down I don't know
what the terminology tells you about
computer scientists but that's not my
concern here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
