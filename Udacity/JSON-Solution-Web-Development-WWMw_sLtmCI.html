to do is add dot JSON to the URLs and
have the response return JSON so you can
see here we've got the JSON response for
that first entry content and created you
know it's got our date and last modified
and subject it's got the text in there
and if we were to go to a permalink for
a particular blog entry and add JSON to
that we'd see JSON for that one entry so
let's take a look at the code that makes
all this work here we are in our code
we're in the URL handler portion of
things I've changed our to URL handlers
for blog to look for dot JSON at the end
of the URL there are a couple ways of
doing this of of checking the seat you
know you could have made special
handlers for it for JSON URLs that's
fine I chose to do it this way and this
is just some regular expression syntax
to basically that the parentheses say
look for this group of things but this
question of my colon says and don't send
it as a parameter into the handler like
like this set of parentheses does
remember for the permalinks so this just
says match you know slash blog slash a
number and optionally it can end in dot
JSON and we did that also on this one
this says match / blog slash well that s
last lashes optional that's what that
question mark does and then optionally
the string dot JSON actually what this
matches is any character JSON these
regular expressions should actually have
slashes in them probably no nobody will
notice and it's a bug that doesn't
really hurt anybody but anyway there it
is another bug in the world okay anyway
let's look at the that the changes to
the handlers that I needed to make okay
so remember we have blog handler this is
our our class that it's kind of the
superclass for all of our handlers that
has all this handy stuff in it I changed
this initialize function so it's still
looking up the users that's before you
know from the previous homework but now
I check to see if the request URL ends
with dot JSON we're gonna set on itself
the format mean is JSON otherwise the
format is going to be HTML there are
certainly better ways to do this if you
had a much more complicated site where
every page can be an HTML and JSON but
for our purposes for this homework this
will work just fine then we go
to our blog handler so we're actually
outputting the blog and we need to just
check out what the format should be
another thing I added is on the post
object we've got our render function
which returns the the post in HTML this
is what we had before
you know using the templates we don't
need templates for JSON what I do here
is instead I create a dictionary
representation of the post itself this
is a format string that's variable here
% C which basically says print to date
nicely and whatever locale you're in and
we use that down here for the created
and last modified fields in this
dictionary I'm so created equals self
dot created that stur F time and then
that time format string you know you
could put in lots of different format
strings to make this date print out
however you like I just use % C that's
quick and then of course we include the
subject and the content in this
dictionary now why do we convert it to a
dictionary because the json library and
python expects datatypes that it knows
how to convert into in the json which
are lists dictionaries you know integers
floats strings that sort of thing it
doesn't actually the json library in
Python doesn't know what a post object
is it doesn't know how to convert that
to json so we create a dictionary
representation of our object first and
then we can pass it in the json later so
if we come down here to the the front
page of our block handler where we look
up all the posts I have a function I'll
called get posts which does some fancy
things that prevent you guys from
filling my blog with spam and try to
avoid showing you that code you know
this used to be the sequel query here we
check to see you know if the formats
HTML we call the front page template you
know this this is this is old code
otherwise we assume it's JSON this could
probably be else if to be safe we're
gonna call this render JSON function
which is defined above and I'll show you
that in a moment and basically what it
does is it take a it takes a list of
each post p4p and posts as a dictionary
calling this as dict function on each
post and then will render JSON here we
are in the permalink handler for a
particular blog post we called that post
page this takes a parameter called post
ID that comes in from the URL we saw
this in the previous homework we just
look up the post
if the post isn't there we 404 if its
format basically else you know if it's
format HTML we use the HTML template
otherwise call self dot render JSON that
post as a dictionary so simple enough
the only function we haven't talked
about yet is render JSON and let's go
find that that's up above here we are in
our blog handler again one function I
forgot to point out I added so we've got
our write and I render stir and our
render function which is for rendering a
template or for you know sending a
template over the wire I also added a
render JSON and what this does is this
takes a D which is I meant to kind of
refer to dictionary but in factually
actually in this case sometimes the
dictionary sometimes a list it could be
anything that M is valid JSON we use the
JSON library in Python you know we just
imported that with import JSON and we we
get the JSON representation of this
Python data structure by calling dumps
you did this in some of the quiz
problems and then we set the content
type to application JSON and then we
write our JSON text and that's it that's
the homework so not actually a whole lot
of code but a lot of little things you
needed to figure out and I kind of
realized after doing the solutions for
homework three and four that you know
maybe you needed a more straightforward
one so there you go now your blog
supports HTML and other people can
download JSON versions of your blog if
they want to you know write little tools
on top of it which would be pretty cool
good job and we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
