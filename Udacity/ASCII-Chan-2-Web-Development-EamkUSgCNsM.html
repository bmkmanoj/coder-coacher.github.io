and we're going to add a feature to
ASCII Chan you don't remember what ASCII
Chan is we started using that in unit 3
I believe and it looks something like
this we just had two inputs on a simple
form and we can insert in some ASCII art
into the box here and then when we
submit it we see our art here on our
page and if we were to reload this page
we would show the ten most recent pieces
of artwork submitted obviously this site
is going to be a big deal a big social
community and I'd like to add some
features to it so what I'd like to do is
I'd like to draw over here a map that
shows on the map where the most recent
submissions came from so that when you
come to ASCII Chan you can see what a
global community it is we have to do a
couple things let's talk about them one
thing I'm going to need to do is figure
out where the user submitting is from so
we're going to need some sort of service
to convert the request IP into
coordinates and for this we'll be using
a service I just found called
hosts IP dot info which is a handy
little website I'll show you right now I
found this by googling basically you go
to host IP dot info and for any IP
address they will tell you where it's
located and they also have an API that
has very simple documentation basically
if we go to host IP API that host IP
info and include the IP address in a get
parameter they'll give us some XML with
location data and I'll show you what
that looks like for this IP their
example IP we get all this information
including city country country
abbreviation and what we're really after
some coordinates in here we've got the
longitude latitude this will be a really
handy service that we'll be using we
also want to draw a map and for this
we'll be using Google Maps and Google
Maps has a really handy service called
static Maps which is where we can
basically make a URL that draws a map
with markers on it and I'll show you
where the documentation for that lives
that is here it's called the static Maps
API version 2 if we just scroll down
here to a quick example we can see the
type of thing we can build given this
URL it would load this image so if we
were to just copy this this URL here and
load it in a new tab we would get that
image with the markers and these markers
are all defined in the URL itself so
that's going to be a pretty cool
handy service so what I want is a map
just like this and I want it to appear
right here and I want it to have the
location of the most recent submissions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
