for optional arguments there are two
possibilities the arguments could be at
least one some real arguments or they
could be empty the first two lines are
going to look a bit like this we have to
call our non terminal opt args because
that's what I called it up here and it
has to match I'm just going to make up
this new non terminal args meaning one
or more if we don't see any of them we
can return the empty list this means
there's one or more arguments so I'll
just pass the buck and assume that args
is magically going to make for me the
answer i want and i'll just copy it from
p 1 into p 0 one of the real tricky
parts of handling arguments is that they
are separated by commas rather than
terminated by commas so once you have
your first argument if you're going to
have a second you need a comma but
otherwise you don't this seems little
weird when we say it verbally but if you
look at it it's more or less just what
we expect if there's only one argument
then it's just an expression some number
but if there are more than we put commas
in between them so here for multiple
arguments we have an expression a comma
and then any more arguments we like and
then finally we get to the last one
which is just an expression well for
this one we'll just make a singleton
list out of the only argument you gave
me so this would be the list containing
one for this example up here and in this
other case my fun of 2 comma 3 we take
this first part just the two and we put
it in list by itself and then we use
plus to get list concatenation list
append to put this single element list
together with all of the rest of the
arguments we've gathered up that's it
for defining parsing functions for
function calls and arguments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
