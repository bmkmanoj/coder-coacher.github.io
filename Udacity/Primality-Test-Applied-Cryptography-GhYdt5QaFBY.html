a large prime which is to keep trying
guesses until we find one that's prime
if it's not a prime then we add one and
we try again because of what we know
about the number of primes being finite
and the density of primes we know that
after a reasonable number of iterations
this will actually find a prime and
return that value we could do a little
better if we assume we start with an odd
number and will assert that X is not
divisible by two since that's very
obvious that it would be Prime and
increment by to hear what's missing is
we need some way to do this is prime
test so here's a naive way to test to
define is prime we're going to go
through the numbers from 2 to X minus 1
checking whether X is divisible by each
of those if it's divisible by any of
those that would mean that it is a
composite number and we should return
false if we try them all and it's not
divisible by any of those well then its
prime so the question is would this work
the possible answers are yes this will
work fine no it's too slow because the
running time is exponential and the
value of x no because it's too slow
because the running time is exponential
in the size of X and no because there's
a silly bug in my Python code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
