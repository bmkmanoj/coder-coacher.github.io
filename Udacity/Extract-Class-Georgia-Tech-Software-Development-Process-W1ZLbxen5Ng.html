class refactoring when a software system
evolves we might end up with classes
that really do the work of more than one
class because we keep adding
functionality to the class therefore are
also the too big too complicated in
particular we might end up with a class
that is doing the work of two classes
typical examples are classes with many
methods and quite a lot of data about a
lot of fields in these cases it's
normally good idea to split the class
into two so what you'll do you will
create a new class and move there the
relevant fields and methods from the
original class so as to have two classes
each one implementing a piece of the
functionality let's look at an example
in this case we're going to use a UML
like representation for the class we
have this class person that ends up
representing also a phone number and
imagine that we added these pieces you
know a little bit at the time so we end
up with something that really is doing
the job of the person end of the phone
number so what we can do we can actually
do exactly what we described here we
split this class into a person class and
the phone number class and then we
establish a use relation so we have a
reference of the phone number class into
this class and by separating the
telephone number behavior into its own
class I once more improve the structure
of the code because now I have classes
that are more cohesive and do exactly
one thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
