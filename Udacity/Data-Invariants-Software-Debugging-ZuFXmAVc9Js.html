writing perfect assertions that cover
all bugs and be pretty hard but this
shouldn't keep us from writing
assertions that catch as many bugs as
possible and this is particularly useful
in debugging since the solutions are
automated they can check several
executions of a function at once
actually all executions however they can
also check large portions of data at the
same time and all automate what do you
mean by large portions of data let me go
straight this by an example let's assume
we want to implement a time class a time
that consists of hours minutes and
seconds and we want to use assertions to
automatically check whether a time
object is consistent that is whether the
hours are in the right range minutes are
in the right range and seconds are also
in the right range here is a time class
we start with initializer or a
constructor that takes three arguments
the hour the minute and the second with
default values of 0 for each and we
assign these two individual attributes
named hours minutes and seconds within a
time object here is a number of
inspector method that give us access to
the internal attributes hours minutes
and seconds after adding inspector
methods that give us the hours the menus
in the seconds we now need a way to
print out a time object for this Python
provides a special method it's called
the re PR for representation method the
internal method with two underscores
before and after and what this thing
does is this method is called whenever
an object of the particular class is to
be printed and this returns a string
representation of the object so what
does it do we're using the string format
method here which takes a number of
arguments and formats each of these
arguments given to the format
specification written here in that
string so for instance call on 2d prints
the numerical argument here with two
digits self minutes also comes in two
digits self seconds also comes in two
digits this format is not perfect yet we
actually want leading zeroes in here and
we want hours minutes and second
separated by colons so here's a string
first the hours two digits leading 0
then the minutes 2 digits leading 0 and
then the second two digits leading zeros
let's try out how this works I'm
initializing a time object here 13 hours
0 minutes 0 seconds we're using a 24
hour clock here and I'm printing this
out and printing this out should now
invoke this wrapper method which would
automatically provide a nice string
representation of our time let's run
this whole thing and we get nice
representation 13 hours 0 minutes and 0
seconds 1 p.m. in the afternoon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
