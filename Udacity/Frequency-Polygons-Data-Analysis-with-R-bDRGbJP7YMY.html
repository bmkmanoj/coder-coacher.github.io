Facebook user data is to understand our
users and their behavior this question
is just another dimension when we're
trying to understand which segment of
our population uses a certain feature on
the website in this case we're running
whether or not males or females in
abusing likes on the world wide web more
often so first I'm just gonna remind
myself of what variables are in my
dataset I'm wanting to compare likes
between the genders so I'm gonna use ww
likes this code would give me a
histogram which isn't what I want and
remember I also need a subset my data to
remove any values for gender that RNA
now this bit of code is starting to look
more like what I want but I've only got
one frequency polygon in here and I need
to so I'm going to use the color
parameter and pass a gender that seems a
little bit better I'm also gonna add
scale X continuous since I know that
world-wide-web likes is on a continuous
scale alright now we're looking at a
reasonably plot zooming in it looks like
males typically have more likes on the
web but I can't really make sense of the
tail end of this graph this is long tail
data so let's use a log transformation
to see if we can get a better look at
what's happening down here I'm gonna go
back to my code and add a scale X log 10
running this code we get a different
plot with much more information
it looks like males have more likes on
the web at first but we can see that
females overtake males at this point in
the graph so this still leaves me
wondering who really has more likes men
or women</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
