IDE let us assume the individual sub
patches all identified by numbers from
one to eight in here again we write a
testing function that simulates the
behavior of the system we assume that if
the patches three and six are applied
then the failure occurs if patches three
and six are not applied together then
the failure does not occur thanks to the
beauty of Python all of our
infrastructure we previously had set up
for Strings also works for lists so
let's see what happens if we test the
entire set of patches we see it fails
which is not much of a surprise because
three and six are both in here if we
test the empty list instead that is no
patches applied then the test passes
again we print out the list we're
testing its length and the result now we
can again invoke Delta debugging with a
set of patches and the above test
function let's see how this works we
invoke d-demon to see whether we can
simplify this list of patches to see
which of these patches are relevant
present run here we get the result and
the final result is patches three and
six suffice to cause the failure well
that's something we knew all along
didn't we so if your original patch
would have been ten thousands of lines
long then chances are that Delta
debugging reduces this to just two lines
or another very small set of locations
in your code for which you then know
that if you change these two lines the
failure will occur and if you don't
change them the failure will not occur
this approach for determining the
culprit for a regression has also been
named the blame ohmmeter as a means to
know whom to blame where whom to blame
means which places in the coder to blame
but it can also mean which patches are
to blame and it can also mean which
programmers made these changes which are
now to blame the idea is that such a
scheme can be used in any situation in
an old version work and a new version
does not so when you have any regression
test failing and a regression test does
exactly that comparing the results of
the new version against the old version
you can and possibly should run delta
debugging in order to figure out which
lines in the code are actually
responsible for the failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
