different things you're going to need to
do you're given inputs which are a
string a pattern number and generations
the number of times you're going to
apply the pattern to the string the
first thing we're going to need to do is
to take the pattern number and convert
it into some sort of pattern that we're
going to be able to use to apply to our
string the second thing we're going to
need to do is create a new string by
applying the pattern to string and we're
going to do that generation times and
finally we're going to need to return
the last new string that we create so
let's first look at how we can create
the pattern from the pattern number
we're given the number of each of the
patterns and one thing I noticed about
these are they up there actually the
powers of two and I'm going to use that
in my code you don't have to you can use
the numbers as they are there but I've
decided to use them as powers of two now
if you're given a pattern number you
need to find out whether 128 goes into
that pattern number so I'm going to do
integer division by 2 to the power 7 now
if that's one I'm going to know that X X
X corresponds to X in my new string
that's my rule and I decided to make a
dictionary so X X X is going to be my
key and X is my value if it's zero then
xxx will correspond to a dot once I've
done that I need to see what the
remainder is so what the rest of the
number is after I've subtracted 128 from
it if it was one or nothing otherwise
and I can use modulo for that this is
going to be my new pattern number and on
my new pattern number I'm now going to
divide by 2 to the power 6 again if it's
1 I'm going to make the corresponding
turn a key with value X and if it's zero
I'm going to make the corresponding
value dot and I'm going to continue
running through all the values here or
the numbers here down to the bottom
seeing which ones correspond to an X on
which correspond to a dot the way I'm
going to do it is to use these numbers
here and run through those backwards so
onto the code now I said that I was
going to set up a dictionary of my
patterns so I'll initialize patterns to
be in empty dictionary and I'm going to
write all the patterns in a list so that
I can refer to them for convenience I'm
just going to let n equal the length of
the string because I'm going to use it
several times so I've got two things to
do I've got to build my pattern patterns
dictionary and I've got to make a new
string by applying pattern to string and
I'm going to do that
generations times so first let me build
the patterns dictionary as I said I'm
going to loop through the numbers seven
down to zero in reverse order and do
exactly as I said before
check whether pattern number is
divisible by two to the power of that
number if that's equal to one strictly
speaking I don't need to actually say
equals equals one because one counts is
true but just for readability I'm going
to put it in and if it's equal to one
then I'm going to subtract power from
the pattern number and if it's equal to
zero then the corresponding value is
stopped instead of X so that completes
the dictionary and now we go on to the
loop which is going to run generations
times to change the string into a new
string so for J in the range of 0 up to
generations
I'm going to make a new string which is
the empty string and I'm going to loop
through the old string or through the
indexes in the old string so what we're
going to do now is step through the
string looking at every pattern and so
we need to build up our pattern so what
is the pattern it's the central
character that we're looking at and it's
the neighbor to the left and the
neighbor to the right just let's think
about that for a moment does this cause
any problems at the end of the strings
because if is 0 we write at the
beginning of the string what happens to
I minus 1 well we get minus 1 and
because Python allows us to index from
the reverse of a string that's fine that
will be the last element of the string
followed by the first one followed by
the second one which is just what we
want let's check the other end of the
string so if I is the last element of
the string then we've got a problem this
element here is after the end of the
string so we're going to get an error
what do we want it to be we want it to
be the first element of the string and
in order to do that I'm going to use
modulo n because I plus 1 when we're at
the end of the string I is n minus 1
plus 1 gives me an and n modulo n is 0
the first element of the string which is
what we want so there we have our
pattern we need to look up a pattern in
the dictionary and we need to add
whatever the character is that our
central character changes to that I
changes to to our string so looking it
up in patterns
I'll get that character once it's run
through the whole length of the string
then I make my string equal to the new
string and the loop continues once
that's done generations number of times
I return the new string and that
completes the procedure apart from a
couple of typos so that should say for I
in range and I managed to change my
variable name here
it should say pattern instead of
patterns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
