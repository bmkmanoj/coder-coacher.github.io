cells but usually instead of words in
the cells will have numbers or data if
this is the case you'll have to copy and
paste the data from the shared google
spreadsheet into your own spreadsheet in
order to analyze it let's get familiar
with this to create your own spreadsheet
go to your google drive all of this is
also explained in the instructor notes
section if you're signed in to your
Google email account you should see a
bar at the top that looks like this you
can click drive or you can just go to
drive google com make sure you're signed
in from your drive I suggest your first
step should be to create a new folder
for this class to do that click this
icon here name this whatever you want
maybe just statistics after you name it
you should see a statistics folder
appear in your drive you can use this
folder to store all the data sets you
work with throughout this class click on
it once you're in your statistics folder
you can create a new spreadsheet by
clicking this button and selecting
spreadsheet you should then have a new
spreadsheet that looks like this then
you can copy and paste the data that i
provide like this flight cost data you
just click command C or ctrl c if you're
on a pc and then you go to your
spreadsheet and click command V or ctrl
V now you're able to analyze the data I
recommend either creating a new
spreadsheet for each new data set or
create a new sheet within the same sheet
by clicking this plus sign at the bottom
then you'll have a new sheet within the
same spreadsheet in which you can input
a different data set then you could call
this spreadsheet something like
statistics data sets and rename each
sheet to what it is and what lesson for
example this is flight costs data from
less than 15 alternatively within your
statistics folder you can just continue
creating new spreadsheets and then
naming the entire spreadsheet the name
of that data set that I originally
provide you that's up to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
