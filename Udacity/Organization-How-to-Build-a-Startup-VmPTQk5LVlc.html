holdover from thinking about startups as
smaller versions of large companies is
kind of the hardest to get your head
around and that's large companies they
have few piece of sales well we need a
VP of Sales on day one large companies
they have heads of marketing I need a
head of marketing in large companies
they have bizdev and all those external
organizations we need those two without
ever thinking about what's the point why
is it that we want to duplicate these
same organizations because if you're a
founder like I was boy you really want
some day to see you on top and look at
all these nice silos working for me
isn't this great and look they're all
doing their jobs etc I have to tell you
if this is your vision on day one you
are already out of business because we
now know that functional organizations
actually are the wrong way to set up
sales marketing and business on day one
what we now know is that the founders
need to run what's called the customer
development team and a customer
development team says listen we're not
going to have sales marketing in
business on day one we're not going to
hire a VP of Sales on day one we're
actually going to have the founder get
out of the building and later in this
lecture we'll explain why it's a really
big idea to understand for organization
you need the founders spending at least
20% of their time outside the building
understanding customers problems and
needs and figuring out how that matches
what the feature set you're building
before you start organising in
functional organizations in silos the
other thing I'll mention which I'll
expand on later in this course is that
one of the mistakes that we've also made
for decades is confusing the titles
sales marketing and business with the
job specifications it turns out that the
title VP of Sales has a very different
job spec in a large company than it does
in a start-up a VP of Marketing does
very different things in a large company
than they do in a start-up and for years
we could never explain
is it that incredibly competent
executives who have been executing
executing business models in large
corporations collapse in startups when
their company is smaller than their
administrative staff in their large
corporation it turns out the job
specification what we do day-to-day has
nothing similar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
