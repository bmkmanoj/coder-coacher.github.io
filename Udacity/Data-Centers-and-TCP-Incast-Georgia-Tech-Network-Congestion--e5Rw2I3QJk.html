control in the context of modern data
centers and will talk about a particular
TCP throughput collapse problem called
the TCP in caste problem a typical data
center consists of a set of server racks
each holding a large number of servers
the switches that connect those racks of
servers and the connecting links that
connect those switches to other parts of
the topology so the network architecture
is typically made up of some sort of
tree and switching elements that
progressively are more specialized and
expensive as we move up the network
hierarchy some of the characteristics of
a data center network include a high fan
in there is a very high amount of fan in
between the leaves of the tree and the
top or the root workloads are high
bandwidth and low latency and many
clients issue requests in parallel each
with a relatively small amount of data
per request the other constraint that we
face is that the buffers in these
switches can be quite small so when we
combine the requirements of high
bandwidth and low latency for the
applications the presence of many
parallel requests coming from these
servers and the fact that the switches
have relatively small buffers we can see
that potentially there'll be a problem
the throughput collapse that results
from this phenomenon is called the TCP
in caste problem in caste is a drastic
reduction in application throughput that
results when servers using TCP all
simultaneously requests data leading to
a gross under utilization of network
capacity in many to one communication
networks like a data center the filling
up of the buffers here at the switches
result in bursty retransmissions that
overfill the switch buffers and these
bursty retransmissions are caused by TCP
timeouts the TCP timeouts can last
hundreds of milliseconds but the
round-trip time in a data center network
is typically less than a millisecond
often just hundreds of microseconds
because the round-trip times are so much
less than TCP timeouts the Senators will
have to wait for the TCP time out before
they retransmit an application
throughput can be reduced by as much as
90% as a result of link idle time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
