Heroku I'm Diego I'll be walking you
through the process of deploying an
application to the Internet this may be
the first time you release anything for
the world to see so it's a very exciting
time by the end of this course you'll
have released a live gallery application
that will display art of your choice
will be hosted on online servers and
available publicly via the Internet hey
Walter what are you up to today need
some help cleaning up hey Diego I'm all
stressed out I'm working on these
paintings for an opening that's coming
up and I'm knowing you're ready well
what do you need to get done maybe I can
help you out well the gallery opening is
the easy part it's all the other steps
that's tough contacting the venue
inviting the guests ordering the food
it's a lot right well it sounds like the
preparation is trickier than the event
itself that kind of reminds me of what
it's like deploying an application on
Heroku there's some configuration
involved the beginning but at the end
it's just as simple as deploying oh I
see we're going with this because yeah
crossing the finish line is the easy
part it's the logistics that I don't
want to deal with I'm the artist I
should be focusing on the work and you
shouldn't have to let me handle the
logistics and you can focus on your art
oh thanks Diego want to check out the
latest piece I'm working on totally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
