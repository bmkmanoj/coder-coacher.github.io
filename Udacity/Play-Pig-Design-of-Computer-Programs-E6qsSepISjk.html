function play pig which plays a single
game of pig we decided that this is a
two-player game player a and B and we
decided we're going to represent this as
a function at some point in the future
we might want to allow multiplayer games
with the more than two players but we're
not going to worry about that for now so
let's make a list of what the function
has to do it has to keep score need to
the score for player a and 4 player B
and for pending has to take turns has to
figure out whose turn it is and that
that turn keeps going until they hold or
pig out another way to say that is score
for a the score for be the pending and
whose turn it is all of that is managing
the current state has to call the
strategy functions so a and B are going
to be strategy functions that we pass in
it has to keep track of the current
state past that state to the strategy
function for the appropriate player
whose turn it is and then that will give
back an action either roll or hold then
it has to do the action the role or hold
and that will generate a new state we
have to keep track of the of the state
we're in but there's one more trick here
and when we were doing the normal search
sort of that was it we had to figure out
what the actions were apply the action
you get to the next state there's a
single successor for each action but
here there's multiple successors for an
action and so we have to do one more
thing which is roll the die and that
disambiguate seeeeee the action of
rolling and makes it not generate a set
of possible states but the action plus
the die that generates a single state so
I want you to write the function play
pig which takes two strategies as input
plays the game keeping track of what's
going on rolling the dice as necessary
updating the state and then when one
player wins return that player either A
or B one thing I note is I don't have
any tests here and the reason is it's
hard to test this it's hard to write a
deterministic test because part of
playing the game is rolling the die and
that won't be the same every time and
we'll talk in a bit about
how to test programs like this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
