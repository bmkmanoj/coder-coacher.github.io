the quiz all right so let's see what
happened here so what you're saying is
in some cases the inputs are discrete or
continuous or complicated in other cases
the outputs can be discrete or
continuous or complicated but I think
what you're saying is that what what
matters to determine if something is
classification or regression is whether
the output is from a discrete small set
or or whether it's some continuous
quantity is that right right that's
exactly right what the difference
between a classification cast or
regression task is not about the input
it's about the output if the output is
continuous then it's regression and if
the output is small discrete set or
discrete set then it is a classification
task so with that in mind what do you
think is the answer to the first so lend
money if it was something like
predicting a credit score that seems
like a more continuous quantity but this
is just a yes/no so that's a discrete
class so I'm going to go with
classification that is correct it is
classification and the short answer is
because it's a binary task true/false
yes/no lend money or don't lend money
got it so it's a simple classification
task okay with that in mind what about
number two
all right so number two it's trying to
judge something about where they fall on
a scale high school college or grad
student but all that the system is being
asked to do is put them in one of those
three categories and these categories
are like classes so it's classification
that is also exactly right
classification we moved from binary to
trinary in this case but the important
thing is that it's discrete so it
doesn't matter if it's high school
college grad professor elementary school
any number of other ways we might decide
where your status of matriculation is is
a small discrete set so with that in
mind what about number three right so
the input is the same in this case and
the output is kind of the same except
there's well there's certainly more
categories because there's more possible
ages than just those three but when you
gave the example you did explicitly say
that ages can be fractional like you
know twenty two point three so that
definitely makes me think that it's
continuous so it should be regression
right I think that is exactly the right
thing you have a continuous output now I
do want to point something out that
while the right answer is regression a
lot of people
might have decided that the answer was
classification so what's an argument if
I told you in fact the answer was
classification what would be your
argument for why that would be well I
guess you think of one yeah I guess you
know if you think about ages as being
discrete you just say you know you can
be one or two or three or you know
whatever up to 130 say but there but
there's just that that said there isn't
really you know usually we don't talk
about fractional ages so so it seems
like you could think of it as as a set
of classes right so let's imagine so how
old do people let's imagine we only
cared about years so you're either 1 or
2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or maybe you can be one
and a half and two and a half and three
and a half but whatever it's it's not
all possible real number values and we
know that people don't live beyond say
250 well in that case you've got a very
large discrete set but it's still
discrete doesn't matter whether there's
two things in your set three things in
your set or in this case 250 things in
your set it's still discrete so whether
it's regression or classification
depends upon exactly how you define your
output and these things become important
I'm going to argue that in practice if
you were going to set up this problem
the easiest way to do it would be to
think about it as a real number and you
would predict something like twenty
three point seven and so it's going to
end up being a regression task and we
can might maybe think about that a
little bit more as we move along
so either answer would be acceptable
depending upon what your explanation of
exactly what the output was was you by
that that makes sense
excellent okay all right let's move
beyond the quiz and start thinking about
exactly what it means to define a
classification problem and then later
what it means to define a regression
problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
