experiments on motion now Galileo loved
doing these experiments just why he has
this wonderful giant smile but Galileo
didn't have a stopwatch instead he
measured time with a water clock and
water clock was basically just a giant
reservoir of water that he kept filled
to the top and that reservoir would leak
at a constant rate by measuring the mass
of water he collected in a certain time
interval Galileo confer how long an
object head moving let's say rolling or
dropping so let's define something
called the time interval and let's say
that one time interval is the amount of
time it takes to fill up this bucket
with one gram of water and let's say
that when galilea rolls this ball he
finds that in the first time interval in
which it's rolling the ball rolls zero
point eight meters and maybe that means
it rolled from here to here what I want
you to tell me is how far the ball rolls
in the second time interval and in the
third now keep in mind i'm not asking
how far it's rolled after two time
intervals that would be the sum of the
first distance and the second time
interval distance i just want to know in
the second time interval it rolls from
let's say here to some point on this
board or on this plane i want you to
tell me how big is this distance in the
second time interval and in the third
you can enter your answer here and here
in meters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
