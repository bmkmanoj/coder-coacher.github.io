first sentence so for the first sentence
I created the predicate slays eggs
feathers and reptile and said if the
animal lays eggs and the animal does not
have feathers that implies the animal is
a reptile for the second one I said if
the animal has feathers or the animal
has talons that implies the animal is a
bird so animal feathers or talons
feathers or talents for the third which
is a longer one I said if the animal
lays eggs and the animal has a beak and
the animal flies all three of these all
in a chain that implies the animal is a
duck and somewhere for the fourth one we
have three predicates on the left side
if the animal lays eggs the animal has a
beak and the animal does not fly then
the animals platypus this kind of shows
us why a platypus is such a strange
animal because we need to make a lot of
caveats in order to find what a platypus
really is good David that looks right to
me so you wrap this part up let us note
that when we define what a predicate was
we said a predicate like flies can map
into true or false well okay a predicate
can map into true or false
what about complicated sentences like
this which are multiple predicates as
well as implications how do we find out
whether the sentence as a whole maps
into true or false that's what we are
going to look at next we're looking at
truth tables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
