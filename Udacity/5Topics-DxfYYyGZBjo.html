I've organized the topics of this course
there are three major parts or units
these units reflect three different
ideas about what a computer looks like
now to explain what that means let's go
back to cs101 there you probably learned
about a machine model called the
sequential or serial Ram model local
uncle there's a single serial processor
connected to memory this processor
issues instructions that operate on data
like a look at the operation of these
obstructions always live in memory when
you analyze the cost of a serial Ram
algorithm you assume that all
instructions have a cost that is bounded
by some constant now from that starting
point you do a big o style analysis in
terms of the input size so that's the
serial Ram model I hope you already know
it by heart and maybe even love it a
little now what are the alternatives to
the serial Ram model well a first
alternative is the parallel ram or p ram
model instead of one processor there may
be many they all see the same memory and
you still assume a bounded constant cost
per operation but you get to work with
more than one processor and since the
processors all see the same memory they
can coordinate and communicate by
modifying shared variables now in this
model your algorithmic analysis will
involve big O's as before but you'll try
to reduce the total costs by up to a
factor of P the number of processors a
period style model is arguably the
simplest one that you might use on say a
shared memory multi-core machine with
uniform memory access losing what's it
don't worry you'll get there so that was
one alternative here's another a
distributed memory network model it's
basically just an interconnected network
of rams that is you start with multiple
Ram computers each computer is a
processor with its own private memory no
processor can read or write the memory
of any other instead they join forces
connecting to one another over a network
they coordinate by sending and receiving
messages over this network now in this
model your analysis will count the
number of messages and the total volume
of communication
okay now here's a third alternative that
will consider in this class it's a two
level input output or i/o model in this
model there are one or more processors
connected to a main memory it's sort of
like ram or pier am but you assume that
there's at least one level of fast
memory that sits in between the
processors and the slower main memory
this model forces you to think about the
following question how much data needs
to move from memory to the processor
using this small but fast intermediate
memory as scratch space now if you know
about things like caches or virtual
memory then you might already know this
basic model but even if that's the case
do you also know how to design
algorithms that exploit it so to recap
we will discover the big ideas of this
course using three machine models the
pier am the distributed memory or
network model and the two-level or IO
model so with that as background I think
we're finally ready to start wooed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
