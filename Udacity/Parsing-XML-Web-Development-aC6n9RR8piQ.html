about is how do we parse XML now I'm not
gonna make you write an actual parser I
think there's actually probably a whole
class on Udacity learning to how to do
almost exactly that what I'm going to
show you how to do is use the built-in
parser and Python Python has a library
called mini Dom and you can get it by
saying something like this now one thing
I would like to point out real quick
here is when you're working with XML
you'll often see this word Dom up here
and what this stands for is document
object model and this basically refers
to the computer the internal
representation of an XML document so
this would be you know in Python you
know you would have an object that has
you know a list of children and each you
know child may you know each of these
children is some sort of tag object and
a tag object may have you know a name
and an attribute and contents and that
sort of thing you'll see this in any
time you're dealing with XML
programmatically you'll see references
to to a Dom or if you're editing you
know if you're working in your browser
you'll see references to the Dom the Dom
which kind of refers to the HMD the the
document the HTML that you're
manipulating programmatically and in
this particular case we're gonna use
mini Dom why is it called mini Dom and
not some something else
well the mini kind of implies that this
is a smaller lightweight version of this
Dom parser and actually parsing XML is
it's actually a really complicated thing
because you can get XML that is you know
many many gigabytes large sometimes and
parsing all of that text is non-trivial
but when you're only parsing a little
bit of text you can use this library
mini Dom which is basically simple and
fast and will break if you throw lots
and lots of gigabytes of text at it but
for our purposes we'll work just great
I'm not gonna quiz you on this sort of
stuff just kind of carry this with you
Dom refers to the computer
representation of the XML and mini Dom
is a handy library for manipulating this
stuff in Python and now I will show you
how to use it here we are in Python I'm
gonna give you a little demo of mini
done before before you start using on
your own from XML that Dom import mini
Dom okay so now we have our mini Dom
thing mini Dom has a function on it
called parse string which is a function
for just parsing a string of XML so
let's go ahead and give that
okay so I've typed up some example HTML
have we have opening my tag some text
and opening children tag now remember
these tag names I'm just making up HTML
has specific tags that you need to use
XML you can have whatever arbitrary tags
you want you know it's up to that the
the people reading and writing the XML
to agree on the tag names I created some
items you know item1 item2 I close my
children tag and I close my my tag now
when I was typing this I had a little
typo here and I'm kind of curious to see
what happens so let's go ahead and run
this with the typo and see hole boy so I
ran this with the typo to see what would
happen and yeah we get it we get an
error a mismatch attack that kind of
makes sense so you know we have a we
have an opening shoulder order in and a
closing children so let's let's just
make this proper okay we're gonna we're
gonna run this without the typo and I'm
going to store it in a variable so I
have access to it I'll call it X all
right this time no exception and if we
were to take a peek at X we can see we
have this mini Dom document instance
let's take a peek at what we have on X
holy smokes look at all this stuff
there's a lot of interesting things here
on X looks like a pen child you know
functions for manipulating the the
document you know all this creating
nodes and sort of stuff like that
some lookup functions these are what
we're going to be using later get
element by ID get element by tag name NS
refers to a namespace all sorts of stuff
parent node you know some output
functions too pretty XML X this is
actually an interesting one let's play
with this one this is when I use all the
time so if we were to take our document
object and call two pretty XML on it
okay - pretty XML this actually doesn't
look very pretty does it at all let's
print that because it's printing out
with this is the Python string with the
new lines in it if we were to actually
print it it would look a lot prettier
here's the XML that I entered and you
can see the structure of the document
and it indents it nicely for us so
that's a handy little function when you
download xml from somewhere you can see
the structure of it a little bit more
clearly with pretty xml okay there's a
function i'd like to show you here get
elements by tag name now if i were to
run this function on our x object and
give it my tag it
turns one Dom element if I were to run
it on item we actually get two Dom
elements looking at the first tag called
item we can see that we have an item and
if we were to look at its children
because we could call child nodes to see
a list of children we can see that we
have one text node if we were like to
look at the first one of those we can
access the node value attribute and see
that it's one now remember a pretty
printed version of our XML what we just
did here is we said get me all of the
elements that are called item so here's
one and here's two and on this first one
which is this guy here get me its first
child which is basically this this node
here which isn't strictly a node but in
mini Dom it's represented as a text node
which is basically just this text
contents different libraries may handle
contents differently but in in mini Dom
this is how we get it and then we can
actually say get the value of that text
node and that's how we got the number
one right there and this you basically
means that's a Unicode string mini Dom
assumed that we were entering a Unicode
string which is fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
