equations I can combine them the first
one is obvious this is the the original
brightness constancy equation the second
one after I substitute in the the Taylor
series expansion there's a little
sleight of hand going on what I'm doing
is I'm substituting for this value
remember it says that I can get the
location at X plus u y plus V alright I
can do the Taylor expansion so here's
the original XY at T plus 1 and then
there is this derivative part okay
I've x times u I sub y times V and I of
X is the derivative in the x-direction
IVs the derivative in the y-direction
now students will usually ask me wait a
minute is that at time T or at t plus 1
is that at time T or at t plus 1 the
short answer doesn't matter the idea is
we're going to assume that things are
changing so slowly and so gently that
the derivative at a particular point is
going to be the same whether I look at T
or T plus 1 it's a little bit shall we
say dicey but actually in the limit it's
true and we don't we only care in some
sense about the limit so taking those
two equations
I've now rearranged things I just moved
this part over to here and then in the
next line what I did was this is I sub T
I sub T is this difference there between
I of X Y at T plus 1 minus I of X Y at T
well what is I sub T well if I of X is
the derivative of I in the X direction
and I sub y is the derivative of I in
the Y direction I sub T is the
derivative of I in the time direction
it's what's called the temporal
derivative and remember our imagery is
now a function of X Y and T so I can
take a derivative in X in Y or in T
another way thing that is if I just look
at some point X Y and I see how much the
the image changes from T to T plus 1
that's my temporal derivative and then
finally on this last one you'll see that
this here is just
i x times u plus iy times v that's just
the gradient I X I Y dotted with however
the the the point is moving that's UV so
we write that like this that zero is
approximately I T plus the gradient of
the image dotted with this vector UV UV
is the direction of motion got it
cool alright keep going now this is
approximation in the limit as u and V
approach zero and you might ask how can
u and V approach zero
well the idea is that in the limit of
course if T was very small the amount of
motion you'd get would be very small you
would just have the direction so we're
going to assume that they're very small
and we're just gonna take this equation
directly as is that 0 is equal to I T
plus the this gradient and that written
out either above as a gradient or here
in algebraic form that's the brightness
constancy constraint equation say that
five times fast Brighton is constant
seek a constraint equation alright IX u
plus iy v plus I T equals zero</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
