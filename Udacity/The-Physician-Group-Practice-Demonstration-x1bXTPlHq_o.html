25 of 27 quality metrics for the key
diseases shown here and you see the

performance Marshfield Clinic earned
half of the total bonus and in
explaining how they did it their CEO
cited a well-developed electronic health
record and went on to describe how it
reduced unnecessary duplication of
services by making information available
to all providers caring for each patient
in fact Marshfield developed the EHR
system they were using and in April 2015
have the largest health IT industry
meeting held each year called hims they
introduced a very innovative new version
of it that combines the traditional
charting functions of an EHR with fully
integrated population health tools to
better manage chronic disease patients
like Marla when they aren't in the
office they also added fully integrated
analytics so that physicians could
easily understand the overall quality of
care being delivered by them to all
their patients and a fully integrated
patient portal so that Marla could
engage with her physicians in her care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
