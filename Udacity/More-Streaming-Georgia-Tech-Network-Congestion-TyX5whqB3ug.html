streaming and in particular specific
applications and how they work we'll
talk about a streaming video application
YouTube and a voice over IP or streaming
audio applications Skype with YouTube
all uploaded videos are converted to
flash or html5 and nearly every browser
has a Flash plugin thus every browser
can essentially play these videos HTTP
and TCP are implemented in every browser
and the streams easily get through most
firewalls so in this case even though
we've talked about why TCP is suboptimal
for streaming the designers of YouTube
decided to keep things simple
potentially at the expense of video
quality when a client makes an HTTP
request to youtube.com it is redirected
to a content distribution network server
located in a content distribution
network such as limelight or perhaps
even YouTube's own content distribution
network we will talk about content
distribution networks later on in this
course
when the client sends an HTTP GET
message to this CDN server the server
responds with a video stream similarly
with Skype or voice over IP your analog
signal is digitized through an A to D
conversion and then this resulting
digitized bit stream is sent over the
Internet in the case of Skype this A to
D conversion happens by way of the
application and in the case of voice
over IP this conversion might be
performed with some kind of phone
adapter that you actually plug your
phone into an example of that might be
vonage in VoIP with an analogue phone
the adapter converts between the analog
and digital signal it sends and receives
data packets and then communicates with
the phone in a standard way
Skype on the other hand is based on
what's known as peer-to-peer technology
where individual users using Skype
actually route
voice traffic through one another we
will talk more about peer to peer
contribution later in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
