here at Udacity the most exciting thing
about front-end programming for me is
creating pleasing and intuitive user
experiences the most difficult challenge
that I face as a front-end programmer is
meeting the requirements of a project as
well as satisfying my own desire to have
elegant code you're always trying to
meet a deadline that's a constant
struggle of how perfect can I get this
and still deliver on time the approach I
try to take is to really understand what
your product manager or consumer want
and iron out the most basic
functionality first get it to a point
where they can look at it critique it
and give you feedback in the remaining
time you have that's where you get to do
the interesting and fun work of
polishing the experience front-end is a
pretty diverse field even when I find
myself with a heavy workload I find it
very easy to stay motivated and stay
engaged in the work that I do because I
believe that it does have like a really
positive impact so to me that's kind of
a sign that is the right path for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
