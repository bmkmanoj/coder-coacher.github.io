policies that address that various
things that we discussed well how well
do they do on those privacy policy we
even actually talked about scoring the
policy that you have have quiz we did
but if they have these policies in place
how well do they follow them or do they
adhere to these policies that they
declare they're following and operate
according to the policy that you had
agreed to you want to do business with
them you want to have a Facebook account
Facebook said you can only do that if
you agree to the privacy policy you gave
consent are they going to sort of stay
within the boundaries of that policy or
they are not and times when companies
actually don't do that Facebook the
example that we're talking about
actually was not only didn't do it the
US Federal Trade Commission FTC actually
had to go after it for violating
people's privacy policy in the sense
that they were doing things that the
users had not given consent to so what
did they do that is bad which resulted
in the FTC action so either they did
something that shouldn't have done or
they didn't do something that was
expected by users that they would do
well they did couple of things they made
information users had designated as
private particular was friend list they
made it public without user consent they
also made personal information available
to applications of friends so the idea
here is friend and they can access
something but this was personal
information that you had not agreed for
the policy for pause the policy you had
agreed to that was made available to
these these applications the shared
information with advertisers
that it had promised not to share with
remember so collect use and the next
thing was shared and you know I should
know who they're sharing it with in this
case they shared it with people when
they'd promised or told me that they
were not going to share and you know
they said certain apps verified which
were really not verified so that was
misleading of course so these are the
kind of things that they did which you
know caught the attention the Federal
Trade Commission and the FT
season went after them saying you not
you're violating your users privacy so
Facebook didn't you know or did things
that were inconsistent with the privacy
policy they had advertised we said the
FTC took action and some of the
sanctions example to that the
consequences of this violation for
Facebook the number of those that the
FTC actually mandated one is that they
had to have a privacy audit and that had
to be done periodically by annually and
this is going to be done for the next
twenty years someone from outside has to
come and do a privacy audit we're not
going to take their word for it their
Facebook is prohibited well not to do it
misrepresenting privacy and security
settings that are provided to consumers
if you say something is not public it
should not be public you should make it
public without the consumer being and
for the user being informed about it and
agreeing to it and they also required
Facebook to get consent before sharing
any information in a way that exceeds
their privacy settings
okay so the consent thing is is big when
it comes to privacy if you give consent
then they can do whatever you can send
it to the idea here is that consent
affirmative express consent because some
default should not be that we can share
without checking with them it should be
that they should agree to it expressly
for you can share it if this is in a way
that is not revealed by their privacy
settings so these are some examples of
the sanctions that the FTC when they
dealt with the Facebook chase they had
they came up with that's what was
slapped on on on Facebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
