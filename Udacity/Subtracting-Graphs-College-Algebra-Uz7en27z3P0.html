X and this last graph represents g minus
f of X 4 F minus G here we see something
very similar to what happened when we
added F and G together since we're just
subtracting a constant function from
this linear one we end up with the same
exact graph as f we can see that this
line is parallel to this one except this
one is shifted down three units G minus
F is a bit more complicated in this case
we're subtracting our linear function
from our constant one this means that
the resulting graph isn't just going to
be a shift of F instead for each value
of x we measure from the x-axis to the
line of F then we look at the graph of G
and we move it down by the positive
distances between the x-axis and F shown
by these lines right here and up by
those distances between the x-axis and
the part of F that lay below it we're
adding this positive distance because we
were subtracting a negative one before
if we connect the tops of all these
lines together we can see if it will end
up with a graph that looks just like
this one to the far right what's
interesting is that now our slope is
negative it's not positive or zero like
either of our two original functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
