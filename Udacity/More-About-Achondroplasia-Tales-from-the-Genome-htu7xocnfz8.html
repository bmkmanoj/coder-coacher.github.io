community you know uh 30 minutes away
from MIT Harvard you know all of the Ivy
League's in boston and i think that's
that speaks a lot to kids and their
value in our value system but their
manners and so forth so i don't remember
getting teased too much i'm sure i did
and how much of that i have sort of put
under the surface and forgotten about
but i don't i have a tougher time even
today when i'm in an inner city
environment where my the people
surrounding me don't have the same
etiquette and don't have the same
education the same exposure and that's
really where i struggle more than where
i grew up in a suburb of Boston um well
to get a bit more of that sort of
educated thought and idea um I want you
to tell us um you know as a medical
condition of dwarfism what is what do
you know is the cause of shorter stature
and in particular in your case what is
the what is the cause of this well
remember they're over 200 different
types of dwarfism achondroplasia being
the most common so if you were to meet
another little person in your life most
likely they'll have a contra pleasure so
I can only really speak to a condor
palasia it is a dominant gene it is also
a mutation so what that means is an
individual can have a condor pleasure
for two reasons one would be their
parents have it and it's been inherited
as it was with my children the other
would be it's a genetic mutation which
is a complete unexplained event which is
what it was for me I am the only little
person in my family my little brother is
63 and my parents my grandfather was a
genealogist so you can imagine he spent
a lot of time looking into this and I am
the only dwarf in my family of origin
but I then went on to meet my husband
who also has a condo pleasure we got
married and we have three children I
gave birth to two of them and I
Lou to Moscow for the third one to adopt
from an orphanage who also has a contra
pleasure but clearly not from me or my
husband she from all we know which is
really not much is a mutation as well
her parents were average height and I
suspect in Russia it's a lot harder to
be a little person I have two children
that I gave birth to one in August of
1992 the other in November of 1997 the
gene was discovered in nineteen ninety
four or five so that meant that my
pregnancies were very very different in
1992 the only diagnostic tool that they
could use was ultrasound and again they
were looking at the femur in the fetus
and they could not measure that
accurately until I was twenty four weeks
pregnant so at that time they told me
and I was actually being seen by the
gentleman that wrote the root of the
growth charts for fetuses at UCSF and he
was the one reading my film my my
measurements from the ultrasound and he
said Jenny this is a tough one he said
that femur is in the seventh percentile
and typically if we're looking at a
heterozygote meaning that the embryo
fetus has gotten the gene from one of
you that femur is going to be over the
tenth percentile right around between
the tenth and the 20th or 30th or
something and you're coming in at the
seventh and that makes us very concerned
that perhaps you're carrying a
homozygous and a homozygote what that
means in later ms a double-dominant many
an 800 pleasure they have found that to
be lethal the baby is born and lives no
more than a week typically more matter
of hours without life support so it was
a really tough call so we went ahead and
went with what we thought was right and
Alex was born and obviously he's still
with us he's 20 years old so he must be
ahead of his eigen although he has had a
lot of medical issues jump ahead five
years later
and in between that by the way I flew to
Moscow to adopt the second child I'm
pregnant again with our now 15 year old
and I have an amniocentesis at 10 weeks
and within a week I get a phone call
from a genetic counselor at baylor
university in Texas telling me you have
a head as i get one hundred percent
certainty so you can imagine the
difference in the stress involved around
both pregnancies I knew what my odds
were when I was ten years old and
babysitting and knew that I wanted to
have children and I wanted to be a
teacher I did that influence my
selection of mate did I say to myself oh
I better not find it I better not fall
in love with another achondroplastic
because we have a twenty-five percent
chance of having a homozygous absolutely
not do I ache for my boys who will most
likely by mere fact of numbers will wind
up with a condor plastic women and this
will be on the table do I ache for them
before they are even you know really
dating absolutely I ate for them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
