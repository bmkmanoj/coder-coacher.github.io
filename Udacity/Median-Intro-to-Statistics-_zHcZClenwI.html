the function median now the meaning of
this list is the middle element of the
sorted list which in this case will be
two of course if there's an even number
of elements let me just add one the
median isn't exactly defined so let's
say I pick it up another two Center ones
all the examples I'm testing with but
have an odd number of elements
okay so let's not worry about the case
where the lists of even length let's
just make sure our code runs for an odd
length so this one is more complicated
to program and there's two hints first
there's a function called sorted and you
can give it data in the output of the
function gives you a sorted list that's
built into Python so you don't have to
worry about how to sort things luckily
not it'd be useful to assign this to a
new list and the way you do this you
just give it a name say sorted data its
data and that gives you a sorted list
and the second thing to know is if you
want to access any element in a
structure like this or in a structure
like this you can do this using notation
like this now this is a tricky thing
this doesn't give me the third element
and this gives you the fourth and the
reason is each list is indexed starting
with zero so this list says five
elements and the indices go from zero to
four so do go to get to the center
element you would have to use index
number two and it gives you effectively
the third element in the list I
apologize for this is all of our
computer science that the indices tend
to run from zero on not from number one
on where's the English language you use
one is the first index some programming
languages use one some use zero Python
uses zero so you have to know this with
those hints you should be able to fill
in the gaps write your code over here
return something and if you print the
median of this data sequence over here
then it should output you at two which
is the median so here's the code to
solve this first make a new sorted list
of the data and then find the
corresponding element in the list to
return and let's assume there's an odd
number of items in the list so things
should always be fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
