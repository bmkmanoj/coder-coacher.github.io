explanation so bear with me the goal of
this question is to find an app on the
Play Store that has low ratings
then we're gonna estimate how much of
that low rating came from violated
constraints so the way we're gonna do
this is by going to the Google Play
Store and we're gonna find an app with a
relatively low review let's say below
three and a half stars so I just clicked
on this app looks like it has a review
of about three and a half stars and
notice that if I scroll down I can see
what the actual average rating is but I
can also see where that rating came from
720 five star reviews 310 one-star and
so on but beyond that I can also click
into the individual reviews from this
page I can look at reviews by newest
helpfulness or rating which will be
especially helpful for this exercise and
then I can read individual reviews
apparently this person's upset that this
app requires camera and microphone
permission in this question you're
actually going to read a lot of reviews
with different star ratings of an app
that has an overall pretty low rating
and as you read you're going to pay
attention to how many of these reviews
reference violated mobile constraints as
a reason for the low rating as you read
these reviews you're going to be filling
out this table so the rows represent the
number of stars and this column is the
total number of reviews with this star
rating this column is where you keep
track of the total number of reviews you
read with that star rating so let's say
you had looked at five one-star reviews
and three of those and violated mobile
constraints you're going to go through
this table fill out all of these fifteen
boxes and at the end when you hit some
mint over on the right side here where
you get your feedback the apps current
rating will be calculated you should
already know that but this would be a
sanity check its predicted rating if no
mobile constraints have been violated
will be calculated as well now this
prediction is of course
it's an estimate and it comes from the
assumption that one the reviews you read
were somehow representative of people
who gave one-star reviews or two star
reviews but also there are some
assumptions baked in about well if you'd
given in a one-star review and said
there was a violated constraint you
probably would have given it a three or
four star review had there been no
constraint by oh you can read more about
those assumptions in the instructor
notes and if you have any questions I
understand this is a bit of a confusing
question feel free to post them in the
discussion forum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
