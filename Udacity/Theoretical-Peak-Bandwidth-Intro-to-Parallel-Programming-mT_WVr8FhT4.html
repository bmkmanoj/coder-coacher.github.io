to the 6 clocks per second memory bus of
128 bits is equal to 16 bytes per clock
so if you multiply this out the maximum
theoretical peak bandwidth of the memory
system is going to be just over 40
gigabytes per second and as a rough rule
of thumb any time we achieve something
like 40 to 60 percent of the memory
bandwidth we'd say well that's doing
okay it's not great there's probably
room for improvement if you can get into
the sixty to seventy-five percent range
that's doing pretty well you might not
be able to improve on that and anytime
you get over seventy five percent we
would consider that excellent okay
you'll never achieve this theoretical
peak bandwidth on any real substantial
code okay this is literally just what
you get by multiplying out the clock
rate and the memory bus and any real
code is going to have additional
overhead so if you can get over 75% of
that you're doing really well and you
probably don't need to optimize the
memory further so how well are we doing
in this code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
