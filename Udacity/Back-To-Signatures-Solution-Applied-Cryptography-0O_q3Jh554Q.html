only looking for signatures here so we
don't need to encrypt the document we
don't care about confidentiality so we
can send the document and clear but what
we want to send along with it is
something that proves that it's the
document that Alice intended to do that
we need to do something that uses
Alice's private key so that's these two
options if we use the public key well
anyone can do that the public key could
be known to anyone else we're assuming
that the private key is only known to
Alice so the only one you could compute
these two things would be Alice and then
we have a choice which one of these two
is better if we believe we can have
one-way hash functions that have the
collision resistance properties that we
talked about well then this is much
better because the output of the hash
function is small fixed size value it's
only for a given security level it might
be 256 bits and we can encrypt that much
more cheaply than if we had to encrypt
the whole document using RSA so that's
why this is the best choice and lots of
protocols are based on this kind of
solution where we use our essay to
encrypt something small which could be a
hash value it could be an encryption key
and then we use that with symmetric
crypto for the rest of the message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
