traversal was pretty straightforward we
just needed to go through the list in
order to make sure we looked at every
element trees aren't linear so there's
no clear way to traverse through
everything suppose we start at the root
do we go left first or right first
should we completely traverse one
subtree or one section of the tree
including a parent and all of its
descendants or traverse everything at
the same level first traversal in a tree
is a bit more complicated but it's
equally important we can't search your
sword elements unless we have a way to
make sure we can visit all elements
first there are two different broad
approaches to treat reversal one is
called depth-first search or DFS for
short in DFS the philosophy is if there
are children nodes to explore exploring
them is definitely the priority we'll
take a more in-depth look at what that
means in a minute
the alternative is called breadth-first
search or BFS in BFS the priority is
visiting every node on the same level
we're currently on before visiting child
nodes BFS and DFS are kind of vaguely
defined since we can apply their
principles but actually traverse the
tree in several different ways for trees
a level order traversal is a BFS with a
more exact algorithm to implement a
level order traversal is exactly what it
sounds like start at the root then visit
its children on the second level then
all of their children on the third level
until you visited every single leaf by
convention we start on the leftmost side
of the level and move right this
traversal is definitely a BFS we're
visiting all nodes at the same level
before moving on to child nodes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
