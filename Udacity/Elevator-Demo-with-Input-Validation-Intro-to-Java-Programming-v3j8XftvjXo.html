where we read in an integer or we hoping
it's going to be an integer and then we
use it here for that first demonstration
of an if statement our task is to make
sure that we get a valid integer here
someone was kind enough to supply us
with the bits and pieces that we need
here is the check whether the user
mistakenly enters 13 whether the floor
is less than 1 or greater than 18 and
finally whether it's not an integer at
all our job is to put these together in
the right order now the first two checks
already assume that the user entered in
integer so we should use the third check
first to test for that let's cut it out
and paste it into the main method and
fix up the flow so we have our scanner
we're prompting the user to type
something in and now we're checking what
the user types and if that's successful
then we call next int that gets us to a
way we were here so everything that's
down here needs to get inserted here
let's do that so if the user entered an
integer we grabbed the integer and we do
our computation let's move on to the
other tests here they are again I'll cut
them out so these ones only makes sense
after I have read in the next input as
an integer so I'll paste them in here so
if the floor is 13 I print an error if
it's less than equals 0 or greater than
18 I print an error this isn't really
going to work because I'm printing the
error and then I still continue with all
of these things what I really need to
say is if this error happens print the
error else go on here let me do that so
I have enclosed all of the original
action inside the cells
now peeking up there still is a bit of
an issue with control flow the floor is
13 then it does this and then in all
cases whether or not it's 13 it makes
this check so we also want to put an
else in here so first we check whether
the number is even an integer if so we
check whether it's one of these two
special situations and finally here we
know that it is a good input and we do
our regular thing
note that we have three levels of
nesting this if contains this if and the
else branch here contains another if
c'est la vie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
