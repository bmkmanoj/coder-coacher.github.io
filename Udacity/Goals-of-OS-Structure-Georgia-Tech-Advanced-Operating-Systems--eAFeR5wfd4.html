operating system structure the first
goal is protection by protection what we
mean is protecting the user from the
system and the system from the user and
also users from one another
and also protecting an individual user
from his or her own mistakes that's what
we mean by protection and this is an
important goal of operating system
structuring an operating system of
course provides services and one of the
key determinants of a good operating
system structure is how good is the
performance of the operating system that
is what is the time taken to perform
services on behalf of the application I
have you've heard me say this even
before in the previous lecture a good
operating system is one that provides
the service that is needed by the
application very quickly and gets out of
the way and that's the key determinant
of operating system structure as well
another goal of operating system
structure and in fact one of the goals
that we will be focusing a lot on in
this course module is flexibility
sometimes also called extensibility
meaning that a service that is provided
by the operating system is not
one-size-fits-all but the service is
something that is adaptable to the
requirements of the application another
important goal of structuring an
operating system is to ensure that the
performance of the operating system goes
up as you add more hardware resources to
the system this is sort of an intuitive
understanding but you want to make sure
that the operating system delivers on
this intuitive understanding that when
you increase the hardware resources the
performance also goes up and that's what
is meant by scalability it turns out
that both the needs of the application
may change over the lifetime of an
application and also the resources that
are available for the operating system
to manage and give to the application
may change over time
agility of the operating system refers
to how quickly the operating system
adapts itself to changes either in the
application needs or the resource
availability from the underlying
hardware another worthwhile goal of
operating system structure would be
responsiveness that is how quickly the
operating system reacts to external
events and this is particularly
important for applications that are
interactive in nature imagine you're
playing a video game in that case what
you want to see is when you do something
like clicking the mouse to shoot at a
target you want to see action
immediately on the screen so that is
responsiveness how quickly the operating
system is reacting to external events</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
