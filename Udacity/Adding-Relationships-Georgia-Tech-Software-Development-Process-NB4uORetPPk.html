is coming along so at this point I think
we have all the classes that we need for
each class we specify the D attribute so
the characteristics of the class and we
also specify the operations so we know
what the class can do and I I like to
kind of move forward on this and by that
first one I see whether you know that
you're fine with the class structure so
that's the way the class structure is
gonna be in terms of attributes and
operations so anything that bothers you
well one thing I didn't understand is is
how come you put check out over with the
patron when it's really the item that's
being checked out right okay so that
actually you know it's perfect segue for
the next thing that I really wanted to
model because what you're talking about
is basically a relationship between two
classes which is something that we
haven't touched on yet so we have we
haven't looked at the individual classes
but now it is typical right we're
looking more at requirements we started
to find more things about our system and
what you're pointing out right now is
the fact that patron and item are
somehow related so this check out
operation is not really something that
belongs only in the patron because it
needs to know about the item and doesn't
belong only in the item because it needs
to know about the patron so it's
something that associates the patron and
the item and that's exactly the way we
call in a UML which is the notation that
we're using here this kind of
relationship so we're gonna represent
that by drawing a line between these two
classes that tells us that there is an
association and we're also gonna give a
name to this since this refers to the
fact of checking out items we're just
going to call it check out gotcha
and notice that this basically you know
eventually will end up you know kind of
replacing this attribute because the
existence of this association will tell
us that this is checked out we're not
gonna you know do it right now but in
the final cleanup or the diagram this
will disappear okay okay and so since we
started talking about relationships and
associations the is there any other kind
of relationship did you say here well
what you just did with checked out is is
seems similar to the whole issue of
requests
it is it is so a request is something
else that happens and both you know in
the patron and in the item right
involves both and in fact you know
requests that I will definitely
represent this as an additional
association so I'll just draw another
line between these two that represent
that specific kind of relationship and I
will call it a request so that indicates
that in this Association refers to a
request that also connects a patron with
an item okay and let's see any anything
else that jumps at you yeah well how
about all these ones down at the bottom
I mean book book an item has got to be
related right a book is the kind of item
and audio-visual are their associations
between them can you repeat that you
said that the book here is a kind of
item perfect that's exactly what we're
modeling next which is that this what we
call the ISA relationship so you said a
book is an item a book is an item and we
can model that in the in the diagram so
we do that using another kind of
relationship between the classes so
we're going to represent that as a
specialization we call it and the
specialization is indicated in this way
with this arrow at the end so a solid
line with this kind of arrow at the end
and we can do the same for book magazine
reference book and audio video material
so we're all gonna connect we're going
to connect all of them to the item using
the same kind of connection and now that
we have connected all this for with with
item and indicated them in subclasses
that's something that we can do so we
can make this kind of a cleaner and I'll
tell you what I mean by that so now we
have this loanable attribute the refers
to item but it seems to me from what you
were saying before that loanable is not
really an attribute of an item right is
more characteristic of the type of item
right right right
books books an audio visual or runnable
but but the others aren't okay so and so
representing it here I mean it's okay so
it will work but it's not really right
so from you know from the style style
standpoint it doesn't really you know
it's not the best way of modeling this
what we're going to do instead
we're gonna use this specialization
relationship to make that more explicit
to make it cleaner okay so what I'm
doing here is that I'm gonna take this
hierarchy of classes this is just on two
levels now and I'm gonna kind of make it
a little richer so I'm gonna add an
intermediate set of classes in
particular I'm going to have these two
classes that I'm gonna call nonlin about
item and loanable item so they're both
items but they tell me clearly that some
items are loanable and some items are
not okay okay and then I'm simply gonna
put a book and audio video material as
subclasses of loanable items and
reference book and magazine as
subclasses a non-renewable item so if we
look at this diagram now it is pretty
clear what is normal and what is not and
it's actually is a very clean and much
cleaner design and I see you've gotten
rid of the loanable attribute - I did I
did because at this point this is
already represented by the fact of
having these two classes and actually
something else that I I did is that I
moved all these attributes value due
date renewed and checked out that makes
sense only four notable items from item
two loanable item so at this point this
really is telling me that you know this
these characteristics are just
meaningful for the loanable item and not
for the other ones well speaking of that
the way that you've got the lines going
in the diagram here is you still have
requests and checked out going to item
even though you can't request non
loadable items you can't check out and
I'm on the miles you're right actually
you got me on that one you're exactly
right so these associations are between
the two wrong classes so I guess at this
point you can probably go and fix the
diagram yourself well can we just make
the lines go from patron to loanable
item instead of to item that's exactly
the way in which we're going to fix it
so we're going to move these two
associations down here and at this point
this will represent the right
relationships in the in the diagram and
in the system makes sense to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
