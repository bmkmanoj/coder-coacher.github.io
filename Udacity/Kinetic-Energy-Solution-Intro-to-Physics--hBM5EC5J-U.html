using the equations of motion that we
learned about in unit 2 or you could
have used our new super cool technique
of the work-energy theorem which is how
I'm going to solve this one well work
energy theorem first we need the total
work and that's given by this equation
well let's take a look at the forces on
the ball well this is an easy one
there's only gravity pointing downwards
okay and Delta X well we're just going
to use this distance 57 meters so the
work is equal to mg times 57 and I know
that's also equal to the change in
kinetic energy and notice that an
amazing but necessary thing happens the
mass cancels out
I can also multiply both sides by 2 oh
and don't forget that the initial
velocity was zero since it was released
from rest and now we have this equation
I just take the square root of both
sides and I get a final velocity of 34
meters per second so now we have another
tool to solve this problem well find
there's actually places where this tool
will solve problems that our previous
tools couldn't I think I teased you a
little too much when I said I don't know
what energy is but I know what energy
does let's delve into that a little more
deeply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
