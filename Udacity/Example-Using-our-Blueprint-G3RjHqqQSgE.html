applying this procedure we've just
talked about now in this case what I
want to do is work with the
OpenStreetMap data for the city of
Chicago Illinois in the united states
chose this because chicago's my hometown
now we looked at an example from this
data set in a previous lesson when we
were talking about extracting data from
XML now in this example we're going to
take a look at a small part of the
cleaning that we would need to do for
this data set this is all human entered
data or for the most part human entered
data so it is especially dirty what I'd
like to look at here is auditing Street
types so for example Avenue one thing we
might be interested in doing with the
data set like this is harmonizing all of
the data so that we have just one way of
writing something that's an Avenue
alternatively what we might actually be
interested in doing is encoding the fact
that this is an Avenue somewhere in the
tag set for this particular address or
encoding it in some other way ok so the
type of data that we're going to be
getting in to our auditing routine is an
entire street name and what we're going
to be extracting is just the street type
and then taking a look at all of the
different Street types that are
mentioned in the data set that we have
now the data set that we're going to
work with here is actually only a
fraction of the complete Chicago
OpenStreetMap data set in this case
we're going to be working with about
twenty percent of the total data set the
entire data set is almost 2 gigabytes so
for text that's a pretty large data set
ok back to the code so as i mentioned
we're going to be getting street names
and what we want to do is we want to
recognize types from street names now
i'm going to use pythons regular
expression module in order to parse out
the street types so let's take a look at
the regular expression that's here ok
we're going to match a sequence of
non-white space characters optionally
followed by a period this is to catch
abbreviations like AB or st as an
abbreviation for Street and this match
must occur at the end of the string now
we're going to use this regular
expression right here and each time this
function audit street type is going to
be passed a street name we're going to
do a match against that string looking
for something like ave or avenue or
street ok let's take out more holistic
look at the
particular piece of code now again this
is just a small portion of the type of
auditing that we would want to do so the
way I've set this up is the main routine
here is called audit and what audit is
doing is it's looping through this XML
file using the sax parser that's part of
the element tree module from Python
let's just take a look there see and in
this case I'm actually using the C
implementation of this particular module
so I'd encourage you again to go take a
look at the documentation for XML III in
particular the element tree module okay
now what we're going to be doing here is
looping through that file we're going to
get one tag at a time here and what I'm
doing each time is asking the question
is this a street name now if we were
doing a full auditing pass we might
actually have multiple things that we're
checking here and be generating multiple
types of audit data in our case what
we're going to be doing is essentially
creating a record of all Street types
that we find in this data set so let's
go ahead and run this okay and here's
our output now what I did here was
essentially keep a record of the number
of times I saw all the different Street
types my parcel recognized as a street
type from the street name we can see
that we've got four different forms of
Avenue the most common one being the
full word Avenue and then ave as an
abbreviation without a period although
there were several that had a period and
again remember this is only twenty
percent of the data type okay the other
thing that's nice about auditing the
data this way is I would have forgotten
about Street types like court for
example and I've actually got three
different types of court represented
here and probably also Boulevard and we
can see that that also is represented so
what we've done here is essentially
audit all of the street types as entered
by the human editors of the
OpenStreetMap data now what we would do
with this particular type of data is
then decide okay what type of cleaning
is necessary do we want to convert all
forms of Avenue into the full word
Avenue and do something similar with all
of the other Street types what type of
capitalization do we want do we want
something that looks like this or do we
want just the first letter capitalized
and then finally we can see that there
are lots of things that may actually
matched our part
which are not in fact Street types so we
need to be careful about that as we're
actually doing the cleaning so that we
don't in fact introduce further errors
into the process okay so I'd encourage
you to take a look at this code which is
shared with you and make sure you
understand how it works the next step
then would be to actually use the audit
data that we have here in order to
figure out some cleaning tasks for
Street types and again as I mentioned
this is just a small portion of the type
of cleaning that we would have to do for
this particular data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
