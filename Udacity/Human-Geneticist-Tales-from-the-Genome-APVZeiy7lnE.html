work and clinical fellowship after many
years and are excited to become faculty
at a Research Hospital studying the
genetics of craniofacial development you
are soon presented with a case where a
family has a child with an air condition
where the external part of the ears
malformed an enclosed to the outside
environment this is similar to a set of
phenotypes observed for Trey called
microtia a congenital under development
of the outer ear now let's continue this
hypothetical a little bit more
groundbreaking work from another lab is
shown that a major cause of microtia is
caused by a particular allele on
chromosome 14 it turns out that this
particular allele promotes enhanced
expression of gene y which is the gene
that causes microtia you begin to
hypothesize that you can develop a drug
that might change the effect of this
gene during development to prevent
children from developing microtia
assuming that the my crochet allele on
chromosome 14 directly affects gene why
somehow I want you to tell me is the
particular allele on chromosome 14
that's causing microtia likely in the
coding or non-coding region and then I
want you to tell me what effect you need
your drug to have to achieve the desired
effect of normal ear development explain
your answer in the box here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
