complicated question out of all the
families with two kids with least one
boy born on a tuesday what's the
probability of two boys now you might
think that the answer should be the same
it should still be one-third because why
does tuesday matter after all the kids
got to be born sometime and if it
happens to be Tuesday why would that be
any different than any other day so is
it one-third well it's gottfried leibniz
said let us calculate so we have the
technology to mala left first random
variable for day of the week and I had
to fool around with the capitalization
there to make sure that we had seven
distinct letters Sunday Monday Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday a
sample space of two kids with their
birthdays one kid with their day of
birth second kid with their day of birth
what does that look like well it's this
huge thing of 2 times 7 times 2 times 7
entries first one boy born on Sunday boy
born on Sunday all the way through to
the last one girl born on Saturday girl
born on Saturday then a boy boy born on
Tuesday is all the elements of this
we're BTW appears in the string so
either BTW will be the first two
characters or the last two characters
and now we're finally at the point where
we can say given at least one boy born
on tuesday what's the probability of two
boys and before i show the results i'm
going to ask you what you think it is
you could follow along either with
pencil and paper or do the computation
or just think it out in your head
samandar as a fraction if you think it's
one-third put a 1 here and the three
here or whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
