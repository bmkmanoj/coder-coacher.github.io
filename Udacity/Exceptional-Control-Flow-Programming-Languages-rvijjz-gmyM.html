exceptions to implement return
statements is this bad should we be
using Python if we have to do this well
there is a lot of language level
exception handling in the real world I
don't think it's a reason to avoid
Python or claim that one language is
more dangerous than another language
level exception handling is super
popular it actually goes back to good
enough in 1975 who introduced a
replacement model that is an amazing
family name I wish I had that name and
since then a number of languages have
allowed you to deal with programmer
errors and environmental concerns both
of which are often lumped under the
category of exceptions at the language
level and this is actually super handy
because the previous approached involves
sort of setting in checking global flags
and programmers are very poor at
remembering to do that consistently
incorrectly even with language level
exception handling it turns out that
programmers make a lot of mistakes one
of my personal hypotheses is that this
is because the control flow for
exception handling isn't visible when
you're looking at the code you can tell
though control is going to flow down to
the next line or if there's an if
statement in Python it's indented over
but exceptions really represent this
sort of non-local jump to somewhere else
and the indenting of the code or the
structure of the code may not make it
clear and if you're not aware that code
can jump out of one line and go to
another you may forget to re-establish
some invariant or close some important
file or finalize a data structure by the
end and in fact even a number of years
ago when I was doing my dissertation on
the subject Oh tragically boring open
source java programmers tended to make
on the order of 800 mistakes / 4 million
lines of code related to exception
handling alone and in fact exception
handling is so prominent that if you
look at an average program somewhere
between one and five percent of the text
of that program will literally be catch
and finally blocks that may actually
seem low but typically a catch or a
finally block if it's not just empty
will call some other error handling
routine and in large pieces of software
anywhere between
re and forty-six percent of the program
is transitively reachable through method
calls or whatnot from catch and finally
blocks so if you're interested in
writing large robust pieces of software
that get deployed in the real world you
will spend quite a bit of time dealing
with handling errors and language level
exception handling is at least for now
much better than the alternative for
that sort of thing is this a reason to
avoid Python we saw in class that we
could use something like exception
handling to deal with in with
interpreting JavaScript return
statements in our Python JavaScript
interpreter no I wouldn't avoid Python
as a result in fact even nominally
friendlier languages like Java are
potentially worse you may not be aware
of this but Java actually still has go
tues go check it out you can put in
labels and then reuse the break
statement if you give it an argument to
behave like go tues so even though
nominally more type-safe more structured
languages or supposed to avoid that sort
of thing in practice a lot of real world
languages be they Python or be they Java
have their secret dark corners allowing
you to write unstructured spaghetti code
this is nothing particularly bad about
Python or particularly bad about
JavaScript it really gets back to this
almost philosophical issue that
sometimes when you detect an error you
don't have enough time you don't have
enough context to deal with it that's
really the motivation for exception
handling when I'm in the middle of some
low-level code that fails to write
something to the disk or fails to send
something over the network I don't know
if I should retry or not depends on the
rest of the application semantics if
it's some sort of network to maneuver
maybe I want to sleep for five seconds
and try again or if it's something like
voice over IP like skype maybe I don't
want to bother maybe I'll just wait for
the next packet to arrive I can't know
unless I know more about the application
semantics so exceptions allow me to
throw that notice of an error up and
hopefully someone else who has more
information will catch it that's generic
to the experience of programming it's
not particular to any one language so I
wouldn't hold it against Python or Java
or even JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
