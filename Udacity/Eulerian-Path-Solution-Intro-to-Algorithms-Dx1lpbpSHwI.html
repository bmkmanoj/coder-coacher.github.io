here's a particular graph where all the
nodes are of even degree and let's see
what happens when we try to follow an
Euler in path let's just pick any note
to start say e go to see there's some
choices here
let's follow an edge back to B or maybe
to D to C A to B and to e so looks it
looks like we were able to hit all of
the edges exactly once
so this graph does have an oil Arian
path but there's something very special
about the path and that is it started at
he and it ended with E and so because
the path actually started and ended at
the same node that node should have even
degree because we go into it each time
we go into it we come out except for the
first time where we go out but then the
last time we come back in so everything
matches up and you end up with even
degree this is a special kind of oil
Arian path called an oar Larian tour to
tour in the in the sense that you know
we start off in our home city and we go
around we visit lots of things and we
come back to our home city so it was we
kind of did a tour of the graph and it
was very scenic so that's an ovarian
tour this first answer is definitely not
correct such a graph can't have an oil
Arian path no it doesn't depend on the
graph it turns out that this is going to
be fine no matter what because we're
going to end up starting and ending at
the same mode and we could have actually
started ended on any of the nodes and it
would have worked out the same way all
such graphs do all graphs that have only
even degree nodes do have Alerian paths
specifically or Larian tours but it's
not the case at all such graphs too
let's let's make a quick example graph
just so you can see it so for this to
work we need to have a graph where more
than two of the nodes has odd degree so
let's make one where for the nodes have
odd degree so we can make these four
nodes F G H and I and let's make it so
that each of them has odd degree okay
now they all have even degree now two of
them have odd degree if we connect these
two guys and then they have odd degree
as well so all the nodes have odd degree
it's not just zero or two all of them
have a degree of three and let's see
what happens when we try to make an or
Larian path so we'll pick some node like
I will go I to G G - f f2 i i to h h to
F and now we hit a dead end so maybe we
didn't want to do that let's instead go
H to G where we also hit a dead end and
in fact you can do this all day long and
what you're going to discover is there's
always going to be at least one edge
that you just can't visit
because again each node in this case has
an odd degree every part of the path has
to come into the node and out of it so
it has to have even degree except for
the end points no matter what we're
going to be stuck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
