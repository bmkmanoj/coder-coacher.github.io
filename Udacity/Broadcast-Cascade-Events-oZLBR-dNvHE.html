events or broadcast events from harolds
paper in this case there are three
concurrently executing machines labeled
aah and D and there are transitions
between them on some of the transitions
there can be an action taking place and
that follows the / the actions that
we've seen so far you can think of as
being equivalent to method calls in our
object oriented class model diagrams but
they can also be the issuing of another
event for example in in in state a
there's a transition between sub-state C
and sub-state be that the transition
itself is labeled with F but then
there's a slash which says if I'm taking
this transition also issue a new event
called G that is we've cascaded the
event now the events themselves are
globally known so the issuing of the
event G here is known to the other
machines in the concurrently executing
stay chart and this process of cascading
the events can go on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
