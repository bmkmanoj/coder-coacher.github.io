each dot in this chart represents the
winning percentage of the Boston Red Sox
in the year between 1960 and 2010 in
this chart the main visual cue that
we're using is position the year for a
particular winning percentage is
dictated by where we are in the x
coordinate and we see what the winning
percentage is by looking at a data
points position on the y-axis secondly
we can note that this plot provides
pretty good context we have an X label
year indicating what the x-axis
represents a while label winning
percentage telling us what the y-axis
represents and we have a pretty
descriptive title Boston Red Sox winning
percentage we might include by year to
make it even better this will help
people who are unfamiliar with this data
really look at this chart and understand
what's happening but as you can see a
scatter plot here really puts focus on
the individual values it's a little bit
hard to discern trends it can also be
hard for a reader to mentally fill in
the gaps between the points and really
understand what's happening from year to
year it's for this reason that we might
want to use a line chart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
