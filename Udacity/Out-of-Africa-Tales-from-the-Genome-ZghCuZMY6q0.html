trace different chromosomes they both
converge on the same notion of human
evolution all modern humans share a
common ancestor from Africa
now with early humans populated Africa
and migrated up the coast to the
Northeast an event of the great human
expansion resulted in the human exit to
the Eurasian continents in the eventual
colonization of Oceania and lastly the
Americas over a period of forty thousand
years humans migrated and colonized new
areas and at every step of the way
each founder population had
significantly reduced genetic variation
compared to the original larger
populations from which they migrated now
we talked about this effect in lesson
six so I want you to tell me what is
this founder effect caused by I want you
to pick one of the following answers and
remember that what we're talking about
here is the transition as humans go from
Africa outwards each time they colonize
a region it's only a subset of humans
that colonized to the gene pool is a
little bit smaller for that given
population as they grow out it expands
again but then a new region is colonized
and so you have a smaller group which of
the following do you think most
appropriately applies to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
