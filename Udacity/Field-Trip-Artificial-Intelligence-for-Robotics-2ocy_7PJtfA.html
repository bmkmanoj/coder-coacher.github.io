to take you on a trip that I recently
did to share some of the things that
excite me in my life with all of you I
actually went to Washington DC and the
highlight of the day for me was to visit
the National Museum of American History
some of you might know this in 1998 a
team led by Wolfram brogurt and myself
put a robotic tour guide into this
museum this robot was in the museum for
about two weeks and it led kids and
visitors of the museum through the
exhibit it did localization similar to
what I taught you before it used a
learned map of the environment we
programmed by hand the specific location
of exhibits and they were was able to
say something
it was also able to smile and to frown
and as you can see in this video
sometimes even kids climbed onto it but
today I'm here to see Stanley Stanley
has been here for a couple of years now
an exhibit our robot that won the DARPA
Grand Challenge and it was really
fascinating to see the thing that we've
built and visited in his own little room
in the Smithsonian Museum this exhibit
has been made specifically to celebrate
Stanley's victory and in exploring this
exhibit again I found that the curators
had actually put some problem code on
the wall for people to understand and
there's a zoom in you can see common so
at the time you're already working with
commentators and in our parameter file
as shown here that would common occurs
many times so what I've been teaching
you in last class about Kalman filter
really had a major role to play in
making Stanley the robot win the DARPA
Grand Challenge so these are deep
emotional moments for me going back to
the past and seeing what we've done and
how it's being preserved but I want to
share that with everybody here because
it's part of my life and it's part of
what we've done in building self-driving
cars and the methods I'm teaching in
this class are essentially the same
methods as we use spec and Stanley and
in junior when we did the urban
challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
