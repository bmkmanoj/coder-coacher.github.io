I've got to define a few terms let's
start with information ratio so recalled
the return on our portfolio for a
particular day is equal to the market
component of the return which is beta
for that portfolio times the return on
the market for that day plus this
residual return another way to look at
that is to say that this component of
the return is due to the market and this
component is due to the skill of the
fund manager remember alpha is about
skill now we want to focus on the skill
component in other words what is the
fund manager bringing to the table and
we can calculate the Sharpe ratio
essentially of this component just like
we can calculate the Sharpe ratio of an
entire portfolio but we can focus on
this skill component and essentially the
Sharpe ratio of this skill component is
the information ratio it works like this
so the information ratio is the mean of
all of the alpha components divided by
the standard deviation of the Alpha
components so this is our reward
component that's our risk component and
by the way this is calculated by looking
back historically at the daily values of
alpha and we take the mean and the
standard deviation of them over time you
can find these by finding beta for the
portfolio calculating what the market
return component was for each day and
then the difference is this residual or
skill so that's how you can compute
historically the value of this
information ratio now by the way this
information ratio applies in many
different cases not just in this
fundamental law case people use
information ratio as a measure of
manager performance all the time it's
fair to say that information ratio is
essentially a Sharpe ratio of excess
return this part that's due to skill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
