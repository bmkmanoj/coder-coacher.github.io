simple one first-come first-served and
what this is saying is that you look at
the order of arrival of threads into the
scheduling queue of the scheduler and
pick the one that is the earliest to
become runnable again and that's the one
that you're going to schedule so what
this is saying is well basically we will
give importance to fairness for threads
as opposed to affinity so it is ignoring
affinity altogether and simply saying
let's just be fair we'll pick the thread
that became runnable at the earliest
that's the one that you're gonna pick as
the next one to run on the processor
let's first come first served the second
scheduling policy is called fixed
processor or in other words for every
thread when I scheduled that thread the
first time I'm going to pick a
particular processor and I'm always
going to stick to that so the processor
on which T I will run he'll always be a
particular fixed processor and the the
way we choose the initial processor on
which to schedule T I may depend on the
load balance making sure that all the
processors in the multiprocessor are
equally stressed in terms of using the
resources for running the available
threads that are there in the system and
that's how I pick a particular processor
but you for the life of this prod the
processor on which T I is going to run
is always fixed so that's the fixed
processor scheduling the third
scheduling policy is what is called a
last processor scheduling policy the
idea here is the processor is going to
pick among the set of threads that are
available to be run at any point of time
it is going to pick a thread that used
to run on it or in other words if TI the
last time it had any cycles from the
system was in a particular processor
then when this processor is coming
around looking for work it'll see oh TI
is there you do surround me I'm gonna
pick that guy to run on me
and as you can imagine this is giving
preference to the fact that there could
be affinity for TI to this processor
because it used to run on this so that
is what is called last processor
scheduling and of course when a
processor is looking for work and it
looks at the run queue it does not find
any thread that used to run on it then
of course it has to pick some thread
right so the the inclination is to pick
the thread that had run on this
processor before the last and that's the
one that I want to schedule on P last
but if such a thread is not available
then you're going to pick something else
so the idea behind this is that you want
to make sure that if this processor is
going to pick a threat to run on it the
likelihood of this thread finding its
memory contents in this processor is
high that's that's what we're trying to
shoot for in this last processor the
next couple of scheduling policies I'm
going to tell you about it requires more
sophistication in terms of the
information that the scheduler needs to
keep on behalf of every thread in order
to make its scheduling decision the next
scheduling policy is what is called
minimum intervening scheduling policy mi
for short and in MI what we're going to
do is the following
we're going to keep for every thread its
affinity with respect to a particular
processor and pick the processor for
running this thread in which this thread
has the highest affinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
