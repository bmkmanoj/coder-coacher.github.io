machine learning problems but two common
ones are supervised learning and
unsupervised learning machine learning
typically involves generating some type
of model regarding the problem we're
trying to solve we'll feed data into
this model and then try to make
predictions in supervised learning there
are labeled inputs that we train our
model on training our model simply means
teaching the model what the correct
answer looks like so for example if we
were detecting spam using supervised
learning we might have 100 emails where
we know whether or not their spam we can
use these emails where we know whether
or not the email spam and train a model
that can predict whether or not a future
email will be spam based on a bunch of
characteristics may be its contents or
whether or not it has an attachment or
things like that another example of
supervised learning would be estimating
the cost of a new house given that we
have a number of examples where we know
about a bunch of features like the
square footage or the number of rooms or
the location and we also know how much
that house sold for we could train a
model and then predict how much a future
house will sell for given we know all
the same parameters this is an example
of regression when performing
unsupervised learning we don't have any
such training examples instead we have a
bunch of unlabeled data points and we're
trying to understand the structure of
the data often by clustering similar
data points together for example if we
were to feed an unsupervised learning
algorithm a bunch of photos it might
split the photos into groups say photos
of people photos of horses photos of
buildings without being told a priori
what those groups should be it might not
know that the groups are people or
horses or buildings but it can tell that
these distinct groups exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
