are and that you can put them in
different folders let's talk about how
you can actually access the resources
that you saved in those folders when
your app is compiled there's a tool in
Android called a apt and that generates
the r-class this is simply an AR dot
Java file and I'll show you an example
next it contains the resource IDs for
all the resources in your res directory
so for every resource that you added now
there's an ID to refer to it the ID is
in a format that is based on the
resource type so for all drawable
resources which are graphics it would
follow the format of our drawable for
all strings that are resources it will
follow the format of our dot string dot
and then the resource name which is
hello in this case note that there are
two ways that you can access a resource
in Java code it follows a format of our
dot resource type dot resource name in
XML though it follows the @ notation so
it'd be at and then the resource type
which is string slash and then the
resource name which is hello here are
more examples of different resource
types and how to access them these are
just a couple of the common resource
types but there's many others just
remember that in Java code you always
start with a capital R a dot and then
resource type a dot and then the
resource name and the name is whatever
name you assign it and then in XML you
have at and then the resource type slash
and then the name of the resource let's
take a moment to find all the resource
IDs in our mainactivity.java file I'm
going to open up the find command in
Android studio I'm going to use command
F or you can use control F if you're on
Windows it pops up a search field here
I'm going to search for capital R dot
and then click on match case so that
only grabs the capital R cases the first
thing it finds is this r dot layout that
activity underscore main reference this
is interesting because we're referring
to the activity main layout file this is
actually how the main activity knows to
load up this XML file isn't that cool
let's look at
the next reference okay in the display
quantity method we have a reference to
our ID dot quantity underscore text
underscore view so this is referring to
a view ID specifically the text view
that displays the quantity hopefully
some of the puzzle pieces are coming
together by referring to this view in
the Java code we can update it while the
app is running to show this number of
coffees let's go to the next occurrence
okay in the displaymessage method we see
a reference to our de ID order summary
textview here it seems like we're trying
to refer to this textview that displays
the order summary so that we can update
it with this message</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
