pretty much set one thing to keep in
mind though as we mentioned before is
that when you save this is where what
you're saving is validated against the
data model you've created so this means
if the object you're saving doesn't have
everything the model says it should or
it doesn't fit the models description of
what it should be you'll be looking at a
nap crash this is where it's important
to recheck your model and make sure
things match up one of the most common
places for this issue to arise is with
deletion let's take a look at our model
again the deletion rule for a notebooks
notes relationship is cascade this means
it will delete all the associated notes
that sounds reasonable if we look at the
inverse relationship that notebook
relationship with a note the deletion
rule is nullify this means that when a
note is deleted all the references to it
are removed they are made no the
notebook just forgets about that note
this also sounds reasonable but what if
by mistake we set the note deletion rule
to cascade also then if we delete a
notebook core data will try to delete
the notes however if the note deletion
rule is cascade course data will then
try to delete the notebook again trying
to delete an object twice is a sure
receipt for a map crash this is a very
common beginner mistake so make sure
your deletion rules make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
