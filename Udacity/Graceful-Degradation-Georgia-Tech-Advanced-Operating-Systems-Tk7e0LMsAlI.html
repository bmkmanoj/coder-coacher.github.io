for managing graceful degradation of
service so DQ defines the total system
capacity so if a server is saturated
meaning that we have reached the limit
of the server in terms of DQ that's a
constant DQ is a constant and so if we
reach that limit then we have a choice
of gracefully degrading the service from
the point of view of the client one
possibility is we keep the harvest the
same meaning that every client request
that comes in has complete fidelity in
terms of the answers returned by the
server so D is fixed Q comes down
because DQ is a constant that's one
option the other option of course is to
keep the volume of clients at a service
that is the yield queue to be a constant
but decrease the harvest so the fidelity
of the results returned to the users is
less than 100% but we are keeping more
of the user community happy by serving
more of them because DQ is a constant it
allows us to gracefully degrade the
service being provided by the server
depending on the choice that we want to
make in terms of fidelity of the results
or the yield that we want to provide to
the user community in other words the DQ
principle gives us an explicit strategy
for managing saturation so as a system
administrator when we make these
decisions on which to sacrifice and
which to keep constant we know how our
decisions are going to affect the
harvest how it's going to affect the
yield how it is going to affect the
uptime and so on so the choices that a
system provider has or strategies that a
system provider can use in structuring
the service knowing that DQ the constant
is when the server is saturated they can
do cost based admission control you pay
more you get more that may be one way to
do it or priority of value based at
control that maybe another way to deal
with server saturation or reduce data
freshness that is the harvest may be the
same but you reduce the fidelity of the
data for instance if I am serving videos
and I can serve the videos at different
bit rates if the server is saturated I
might decide to serve the video to all
the users all the videos that they want
but at a lower bitrate so that is
reducing the fidelity of the data that
is being harvested so that's the idea
behind the DQ principle how it might be
used for graceful degradation of service
when the server is saturated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
