we're going to continue introducing
particle filters for tracking I also
want to say thank you I think it's
Sebastian run and endured eater fox or
somebody else who's done a bunch of
slides that have actually lost their
authorship is lost to all of humanity
because if you take a look at particle
filter you'll see these same pictures
everywhere so whoever did them Thanks
all right so you remember I hope that
the reason we're doing all this is
because unlike Kalman filter where we
were going to represent the densities to
where things are the nice Gaussian the
ideas we might want to have an arbitrary
density and graphically this that's
what's shown here the idea of
propagating a density through time now
the basic idea that we're going to make
use of is instead of having some sort of
analytic representation of our densities
we're going to have these set of
particles we talked before about how the
distribution in terms of where the
particles are and perhaps the weight of
the particles that's what we're going to
substitute for the density right and our
goal is so that as we're doing this
tracking eventually we have a set of
particles such that the probability that
you get a particle at some particular
place is essentially the probability
that this state is actually at that
place having observed all the
observations and the way we do this is
we're going to do this as a Bayes filter
we introduce this last time where we
said that basically you take your
prediction from before and the way you
get to your prediction is you take your
previous belief of all the different
places you might be and talk about the
probability that you could end up at
some given XT you some that all up and
that's your prior belief that you could
be a texty you take your measurement you
multiply it by your likelihood and
because of Bayes rule which does this
the swapping of the variables that gives
us our new belief about XT so we're
going to take particles and we're going
to define a Bayes filter using those
particles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
