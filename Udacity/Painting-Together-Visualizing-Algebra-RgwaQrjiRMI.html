in 12 7 hours time great thinking if you
found this fraction 12 7 s is equal to
one hour and five sevenths of an hour if
we do some conversion converting this to
minutes it would be about one hour and
43 minutes and here's the equation we
want to set up we know that Tim can
paint the room in four hours time so if
we complete one job in four hours the
other way of thinking about this is that
he'll complete one for the job in one
hour the nest is painted the room and
three hours which means you can complete
the full job in three hours time job per
hours so notice that we can think about
this as a rate we have ten completing
one job in four hours and Vanessa
completing that same job in three hours
so if we add thereto rates together we
would get them completing the job in X
hours time the time you want to find and
now here's the other way we were
thinking about it tin can complete one
fourth of the job in one hours time
Vanessa could complete one third of the
job in one hours time so together they
can complete one over X of the job in
one hours time we start solving this
equation by multiplying through by the
LCD the least common denominator is 4
times 3 times X or 12 X we multiply each
fraction by this number and that gives
us 3x here for X here and 12 here we add
our like terms on the left to get 7x
equals 12 and finally we divide by 7 to
get 1 x is equal to 12 sevens this is
the amount of time it takes them to
paint the room together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
