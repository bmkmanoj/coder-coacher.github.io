underscore underscore data underscore
underscore property which corresponds to
an object opening up that object we see
we have the fields of a single row from
our data file which we saw earlier as
the dot enter selection but now instead
of corresponding to only underscore
underscore data underscore underscore
with the fields and now is actually
bound to a circle so the combination of
the enter selection with the append
merges the data from our data file with
the SVG circle element and this is where
the mysterious data of D threes magical
data bound lives it's simply a
JavaScript object attached as a property
to the SVG node living in the DOM and as
we can see here on the Left again is the
selection of what lives on the page
either as HTML or SVG starting with the
select of the parent SVG element which
contained in it has a SVG circle element
for each row of our data file World Cup
TSP which d3 binds with its data
function as you can see here
corresponding to the link to a row of
our file which was loaded and stored in
the data variable which again is a
single row from our world cup PSV data
file so think of these linkages as the
magic data bind everything on the left
side as what's present on the page
either as SVG or HTML and everything on
the right side as either a JavaScript
object or some piece of our data file
and here I represent all 836 rows simply
by the dotted arrow which means that
this extends all the way down binding
every row to every circle if any of this
was unclear I encourage you to read
through Mike's post on the subject which
has contained the lecture notes or if
you want a more complete treatment of
the
subject look at the book reference in
the lecture notes visual storytelling
with d3 by Richie s King which inspired
this graphic and explanation of the
mysterious data bind process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
