opposed to the cyber assets that we have
so this is going to require that we
understand the risk to the online
information and the systems where it is
stored and how they're connected and who
they can be accessed by and things like
that so these kind of questions are
exactly what we call developing a
security mindset the security mindset is
really asking the kind of questions that
I was just talking about so if you say
well what exactly you know how do you
define a security mindset you have to
say well who are the bad actors what can
possibly they exploit what
vulnerabilities do I have and if they're
successful in exploiting a vulnerability
what is that attack going to be so in
the security mindset the first thing we
worry about is what is the threat source
in particular who is the entity that
wants to do us harm so they're obviously
these criminals who are in it for the
money
professional criminals who want to
profit from the data that they can steal
there's another sort of threat source
people worry about this is activists who
use the Internet
in particular hacking that's why they
called activists and they have some sort
of an agenda people may agree with it or
may not agree with it when you sort of
think about Snowden well he had an
agenda he didn't like certain things the
US government was doing and that was the
reason for him it wasn't that he was
trying to profit from the information
that he took but the reason really was
activism finally threats can come from
nation states and countries are actually
doing this
they're doing it for political advantage
they're doing it for spying on each
other so the risk comes from sort of the
threat source sort of the entire
spectrum from set of group of criminals
all the way to nation-states so threats
are clearly very real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
