but i would say that actually for each
three of these you could say maybe so if
you don't have much time to design and
program an algorithm then brute force
might be okay under certain conditions
so for example when your instances are
small and you have proper time to run
the algorithm then brute force might
actually be a good idea because it's
your time that you invest into
programming a more sophisticated
algorithm if it's your time that counts
and not computer time doing brute force
is sometimes actually a good solution
whatever the instances are small there's
two reasons to use brute force one is
because you can implement it very fast
but the other good reason to use brute
force in these cases here is that
because brute force algorithms are so
simple they can be programmed with very
little overhead so what I mean by that
is that the constants that are involved
in the O notation are rather small and
for small instances such speed ups
actually play a role for small instances
it could be a good idea to use brute
force but again even for these small
instances it might not be fast enough
when you need to solve a problem only
once that might also be a condition
where brute force could be okay that
might mean that you have a lot of
computational time available so say you
need to have this problem solved within
the next three months or six months
maybe then brute force is kind of fast
enough of course in this case down here
I think that's the most available you
might want to try some of the more
sophisticated techniques that I'm about
to show you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
