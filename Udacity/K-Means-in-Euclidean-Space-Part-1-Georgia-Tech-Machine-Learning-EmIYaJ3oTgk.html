up to a proof that k-means does
something good and to do that I think it
was helpful to have a little bit more
precise notation than when I was doing
before so here we go let's we're gonna
work up to doing k-means in a Euclidean
space and the notation that I'm going to
use is we've got at any given moment in
time in the algorithm there's some
partition P Super T of X and these
clusters are defined the same way that
we did before which it just returns the
you know some kind of identifier for
what cluster X is in and this is at
iteration T of k-means we also have
another kind of more convenient way of
writing that which is C sub I of T which
is the set of all points in cluster I
it's really but just the same as the set
X such that P of X equals I that make
sense yeah okay that makes perfect sense
you've got some kind of partition and
everything in the same partition belongs
together in something you're calling C
for cluster good and we're also going to
need to be able to refer to the center
of a cluster because we're in a
Euclidean space it's meaningful to add
the objects together so take all the
objects that are in some cluster C I at
iteration T and divide by the number of
objects in that cluster so just just
summing those points together this also
comes called the centroid right right so
what's the mean or the centroid yeah
it's like that's right I mean in one
dimension it's definitely the mean in
higher dimensions it's like a per
dimension mean no so in fact you're
gonna end up with K so now here's an
equation arrow version of the algorithm
that we start off picking centers in
some way for iteration zero and we hand
it over to this process that's going to
assign the partitions in particular the
partition of point X is going to be the
minimum over all the clusters of the
distance between X and the center of
that cluster all right so it's just
assigning each point to its closest
center does that make sense
mm-hmm and that all those bars with the
sub two just mean Euclidean distance
yeah we're just that's right exactly
we're just computing the distance
between those two things and we hand
that partition over
to the process that computes the center
so it's it's now using this other
representation of the clustering CI it's
adding the points together divided by
the number of points in that cluster and
it hands those centers back to this
first process to recompute the cluster
so we're going to be ping-ponging back
and forth between these two processes
okay
sure and T keeps getting updated after
every cycle right yeah so this is where
T gets incremented T plus plus so this
is the algorithm and an interesting fact
about it is do you remember when we
talked about optimization I do remember
we talked about optimization an
optimization is good because it's
finding better and better answers so if
we can think of this as being kind of an
optimization algorithm then that could
be good it could be that what we're
doing what we're going around here is
not just randomly reassigning things but
actually improving things okay well how
are you gonna convince me of that all
right let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
