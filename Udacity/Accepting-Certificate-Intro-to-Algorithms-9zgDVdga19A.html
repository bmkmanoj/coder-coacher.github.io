problem is in NP if it has a short
accepting certificate an accepting
certificate is information that we can
use to quickly show that the answer to
the decision problem is yes if it
actually is yes and here short means
polynomial size and quickly means
polynomial time so to define NP even
more formally we're going to say a
problem is in NP if there is a
verification algorithm this is a
basically computer program called a like
a subroutine a such that for any input
for the problem that is a yes there is a
certificate C such that C is polynomial
the size of C is polynomial in the size
of X and the verification algorithm will
say yes but for any X that is a no there
is no certificate C that's polynomial e
sized with respect to X and the and the
verification algorithm says yes so for
any yes answer to the problem our
verification algorithm will say yes for
some small certificate otherwise it will
say no for all small certificates so for
the sodoku example the verification
algorithm is what we described as
something that takes the original Sudoku
problem with things not filled in and
the answers printed in the back of the
magazine with the answer filled in and
it checks to see whether this is
actually a solution to that if it is
then it says yes and if it's not it says
no now this is going to fit the NP
definition that we've got here because
for any Sudoku problem that is solvable
there's some grid that we can solve it
and we can show what that grid looks
like but for any problem that's not
solvable there's no way that we can fill
in this grid with numbers so that the
verification algorithm will say that
it's okay so it really is back to the
definition of basically the Sudoku
problem the Sudoku problem says is there
a way of filling it in and the
certificate that we use is well we'll
show you how it's filled in it fits both
halves of this definition
so this problem is in NP now let's be a
little careful here because Sudoku as
it's typically designed doesn't really
have an input size all the inputs are of
the same size but you can imagine a
generalization of Sudoku where you have
a bigger grid and maybe more symbols and
the same kind of verification procedure
works the bigger the grid gets the
longer it takes to run but it's always a
polynomial in the size of the input grid
so let's try to put this definition to
work and answer the following question
who is P contained within or possibly
equal to NP so one possibility here is I
don't know and if I knew that I'd win a
Fields Medal meaning sort of the
equivalent of the math Nobel Prize
because this is a big important open
question another choice is No P is not
contained within NP because if the
problem is in P means it's decidable in
polynomial time then we don't need any
kind of certificate and so it's not an
NP and then finally the opposite of that
is yes if it can be decided in
polynomial time no certificate is needed
all right if you have a problem that's
in P then you don't need any sort of
certificate so it's also in NP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
