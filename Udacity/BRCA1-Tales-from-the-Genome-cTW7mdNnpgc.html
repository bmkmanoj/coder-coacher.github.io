and maintenance cells grow and divide as
they do in any tissue and as we learned
about in lesson 6 with many other cell
divisions mutations occur all the time
every time the DNA is copied to go into
new daughter cells there's an
opportunity for new mutations to become
introduced typically most all of these
mutations are repaired or fixed so that
the cells can go on performing their
normal functions and providing structure
and function to an overall tissue in the
breast but if enough mutations and
critical genes go unrepaired then
there's a high likelihood that cells
will start growing out of control and
form the beginning of a tumor that you
can see here now remember mutations are
going on all the time and so your body
is really constantly fighting a losing
struggle in some sense because mutations
will keep happening and at some point if
your body isn't able to repair them all
one or two or possibly more are going to
disrupt normal function and likely lead
to the initiation of tumor formation now
obviously there are many important
proteins responsible for repairing
mutations when they happen but two that
are really relevant from breast cancer
are the genes called brca1 and brca2 we
might call them Braca 1 &amp;amp; bracket 2
carol has a mutation in bracket 2 other
women have mutations in bracha 1 either
way mutations in either of these genes
disrupt this process of mutation repair
and can lead to a much higher breast
cancer risk let's chat a bit more about
Braca one which has been pretty well
studied the bracken 1 gene can be found
on chromosome 17 in the human genome in
chromosome 17 is about 81 million base
pairs and Wrekin 1 can be found about
halfway down the length of the
chromosome the gene itself has 23 exons
spanning 80,000 base pairs of DNA after
transcription and splicing the resulting
mRNA has 5000 592 nucleotides of coding
region between the start and stop codons
this results in a protein that has 1,863
amino acids
now there
multiple alleles of Braca one that are
associated with a high risk of early
onset breast cancer but one allele in
particular has an insertion of a
cytosine at position 5380 2 of the
coding region as shown right here using
the genetic code that we learned about
in lesson 3 and that you can find about
and the instructors notes on this page I
want you to determine the expected
change an amino acid sequence and then
select the type of mutation that you
think this is best categorized as again
if you have trouble answering this
review mutations from lesson 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
