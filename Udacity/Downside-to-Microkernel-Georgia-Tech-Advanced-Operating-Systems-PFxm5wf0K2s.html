based approach well there is there is a
potential for performance loss now
consider this monolithic structure let's
say this application makes a call to the
file system to open a file the
application slips through this red line
into the hardware address space of the
operating system runs in privileged mode
because the operating system may have to
do certain things that are privileged
and therefore the hardware architecture
of the CPU usually allows a privileged
mode for execution of the operating
system code so now the app is now inside
the operating system in a privileged
mode with one instruction usually called
a trap instruction for example a system
call results in a trap into the
operating system and once inside the
operating system all the work that needs
to be done in order to satisfy the
filesystem call that the app made for
instance contacting the Storage Manager
contacting the memory manager and so on
all of that are available as components
within this blob which means that those
components can be accessed at the speed
of normal procedure call in order to
handle the original request from this
application on the other hand if you
look at a microkernel based structure
the application has to make an IPC call
in order to contact the service which is
in this case a filesystem service let's
say which means that the application has
to go through the microkernel making the
IPC call going up to the file system and
the filesystem does the work makes
another IPC call in order to deliver the
results of that system service back up
to the application so the minimum
traversal that you can see is going from
the application of the microkernel
microkernel to the file system and back
into the microkernel and back up to the
application potentially there may be
many more calls that may happen among
servers that are sitting above the
microkernel because a file system may
have to contact the Storage Manager and
the file system may have to contact the
memory manager all of those are server
processes living above the microkernel
and all of them require IPC for talking
to one another so what that means is
that with this structure there is a
potential that we may have to switch
between the address spaces of the
application and many services that are
living on top of the microkernel whereas
in the case of the monolithic structure
that I showed you here there is only to
address phase switches one to go from
the application into the operating
system and the other to return back to
the application whereas in a microkernel
based design they could potentially be
several address based switches depending
on the number of servers that need to be
contacted in order to satisfy one system
call that may be emanating from the
application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
