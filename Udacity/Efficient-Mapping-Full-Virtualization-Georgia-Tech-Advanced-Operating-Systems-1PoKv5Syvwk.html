setting the guest operating system has
no idea about machine pages it thinks
that the physical page number that it is
generating is a real thing but it is not
and therefore there is two levels of
indirection one level of indirection
going from virtual page to physical page
that's an illusion then the hypervisor
has to take this physical page and using
the shadow page table converted into the
machine page and as I said this shadow
page table may be the real hard web page
table that the CPU uses as well so
there's a reader structure that is
maintained by the hypervisor to
translate the PPN to MPN so how to make
this efficient because on every memory
access of a process of the guest
operating system the virtual address has
to be converted to a machine address so
in other words we want to avoid the one
level of indirection that's happening
because the virtual page number has to
be converted to a physical page number
by the guest operating system and then
it has to be looked up in the shadow
page table by the hypervisor to generate
the Machine page number so we would like
to make this process more efficient
because it's happening on every memory
access but getting rid of one level of
indirection that is this translation by
the guest operating system remember that
the guest operating system is the one
that establishes this mapping in the
first place between a virtual page
number and the physical page number by
creating an entry in the page table for
the process that is generating this
virtual address in the first place and
updating the page table is a privileged
instruction so when the guest operating
system tries to update the page table or
what it thinks is the page table it will
result in a trap any time the guest
operating system tries to update this
page table to establish a mapping
between VPN and PPN there will be a trap
and this trap is caught by the
hypervisor and what the hypervisor is
going to do is it is basically going to
say oh this particular VPN corresponds
to a specific entry in the shadow page
table so the update that the guest OS is
making to its page table data structure
which it thinks is the real thing is not
the real thing the hypervisor is
updating the same mapping by saying well
this particular VPN is going to this
machine page number that's the one that
we're going to put as the entry here so
as a result what we have done is even
though there is a solution
the real translations that is a mapping
between VPN and NPN is remembered in the
shadow page table which may be the
hardware page table if the processor is
using the page table for its address
translation or it could be the TLB in
either case the hypervisor is going to
install the translation from VPN to NPN
into the TLB and the hardware page table
so now we basically bypassed the guest
operating systems page table in order to
do the translation because every time a
process generates a virtual address we
are not going through the guest
operating system to do the translation
but so long as the translation has
already been installed in the plb and
the hardware page table the hypervisor
without the intervention of the guest
operating system can translate the
virtual page number of a user level
process running on top of the guest
operating system directly to the Machine
page number using the TLB and the
hardware page table so this is a trick
to make address translation efficient
because it's extremely crucial that on
every memory access we don't go through
the guest operating system to do the
address translation it's just not
acceptable and this is the trick that is
used in VMware ESX server that is
implemented on top of intel hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
