for grant to tell him how much he would
earn in the future once people actually
paid for the glasses wipers and nozzles
I had ordered was that his total future
earnings is equal to 84 w where w is the
price per wiper set plus 60 n where n is
the price per nozzle however there's
been another change in the situation and
considering the last change that
happened to grant which was the
cancellation of orders that made him
really really sad this is a super
positive update first grant got a
telephone call from an elderly wealthy
gentleman named mr. Belvedere who
happens to be super interested in
glasses wipers and in the nozzles that
Grant has developed to go along with his
wiper blades he was so enthusiastic
about grants inventions that he offered
to triple all of the orders that Grant
had brought in so far which means that
grants total future earnings which we
know before were 84 w plus 60 n will be
multiplied by 3 then a second piece of
good news came a school principal called
grant and let him note that she wanted
to order one wiper blade set in one pair
of nozzles for each of her 150 students
who wear glasses this however it
happened after mr. Belvedere decided to
triple the orders that had come in so
far so his tripling does not apply to
this new batch of orders from the school</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
