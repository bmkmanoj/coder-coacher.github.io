Android TV app Android TV is just
Android on a new form factor so if
you're already proficient with Android
development your existing skills will
still apply first we'll work through a
starter project and explain how the key
pieces work step by step next we'll
apply these concepts that we've learned
it by enhancing the mobile version of
the universal media player to also run
on the TV form factor in the very same
APK here's how the universal media
player looks when we start and here's
how it looks when we're done how cool is
this it's complete with high-quality
animations and responsive cinematic you
I to build our app we're going to
leverage the Leanback support library
the Leanback library is so easy to use
and so versatile that it's become
synonymous with writing Android TV apps
in fact this entire UI was built using
lean back with very little coding on our
part that said though lean back is just
a library you don't have to use it at
all and you have complete freedom over
how your app looks and feels now if you
have an existing app you'd like to run
in the big screen it's important not to
reuse the same activity layout that you
already have four phones and tablets
although technically this will work on
Android TV it will make for a poor user
experience and if you do that Timothy
Jordan will get angry and you don't want
to see him angry in reality Timothy is a
super nice guy but just to be sure your
UI should be simple cinematic and fun
for this lesson all you'll need is
Android studio will use a TV emulator to
run our code so everyone can participate
if you happen to have a real TV device
though you can use that as well in fact
I'd strongly recommend using a real
device instead of an emulator for
developing Production apps sound good
let's get a wrap running on the big
screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
