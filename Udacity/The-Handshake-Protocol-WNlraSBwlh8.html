protocol as we have discussed the
handshake protocol established is a TLS
session and he negotiates the security
parameters between the client and a
server the phase 1 of the protocol
establishes the security capabilities it
is initiated by the client sending a
client hello message to the server the
kind hello message contains a number of
parameters including version number
session ID crypto suite compression
method and the initial random numbers
after sending the client hello message
the client waits for the server hello
message which contains the same kind of
parameters as the client hello message
therefore at the end of phase 1 both the
client and a server know each other's
security capabilities the details of
phase 2 depend on the underlying public
key encryption scheme that is being used
in some cases the server passes a
certificate to the client and possibly
some additional key information and a
request for certificate from the client
the final message has to be server hallo
done which indicates the end of phase 2
in phase 3 the server should first
verified the certificate of the server
for example if the client is connecting
to a server
say George attacks website then the
client should be able to verify that the
certificate contains the George attacks
public key that is the public key
certificate is Georgia Tech's public key
sign by the public key of the
certificate authority Ana client has the
private key of the certificate authority
to verify the certificate then the
client can send key exchange information
through a server for example the client
can generate a secret key and encrypt
the secret key using the server's public
key and send it to the server depending
on the application requirements the
client may send a certificate to the
server in order to authenticate the
client to the server usually
if a website is public-facing then the
authentication is typically one way that
is the client needs to authenticate the
server but a server does not require the
client to authenticate itself on the
other hand for internal or private web
servers mutual authentication may be
required in Phase two the client sends a
change cipher spam message and copies
the pending security parameters to the
current ciphers back it then signals the
completion of the handshake protocol in
response the server sends its own change
ciphers back
therefore they now agree on the security
parameters and then the server sends its
own message to signal the end of
handshake at this point the Henchy is
complete and the current server can
begin to exchange application layer data
protected using the agreed-upon security
parameters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
