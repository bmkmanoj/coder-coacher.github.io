get through and this was actually an
idea proposed by eleven at all in their
paper which is also referenced at the
end of this lecture and it'll be
available for you to look at is how can
we actually create a coded aperture so
this is my conventional aperture right
just a opening I know the size I know
the amount of light that it goes through
can we actually create a mask refer to
as a code here and on the aperture plane
that makes the D focus planes different
when they actually register on the
sensor and if they're different there
might be easier to discriminate so
basically that's just as we want to
actually add a coded aperture which
basically lets in less light but in a
known pattern like this
what's the artifact of this let's look
at exactly the example we looked at
before of our lens and D focus remember
we had looked at this before we
basically had an object moved up and of
course it created these patterns from a
single light source so here of course we
have an image of a de focus point light
source of course when we replace it this
will look different right because now
less light will come in of course that
basically says how do we what kind of
build this is we now create obstructions
on the lens like I'm just gonna show you
one simple example here basically how
I'm gonna represent these things are
simple obstructions shown here so
basically this line here is clear maybe
considered to be one of these things and
I'm gonna basically say if I put an
obstruction like this on the lens
basically means is now this part of the
light is not making it to my sensor and
of course that translates into a spread
function that would be different
similarly I would actually put another
one just to kind of see what the effect
is and again that also goes in there and
translation is that of course now I have
a point spread function that also has a
different one you know maybe like this
this was the output based on this again
notice this is what we're trying to do
here the same object far away putting
simple two obstructions we get a newer
image or a newer output but we can now
start calibrating this recall again we
did this kind of same trick when we were
talking about light field cameras again
simple example further same obstructions
I move the object closer
spread function is different of course
now I can start calibrating for these
types of things as I move closer and
closer you can basically see at the end
of it it doesn't matter what it is if I
actually move the light source here the
spread function will come back to what I
expected for a regular aperture because
this everything is in focus of course
the final one when the object is at the
focal plane of course the image is
created here a spread function is there
and while there might be a small impact
off the obstructions here for a full
focus thing you'll actually get a spread
you know the image to be much smaller
and a point spread function that also be
like the one we had expected in case
when there was no obstructions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
