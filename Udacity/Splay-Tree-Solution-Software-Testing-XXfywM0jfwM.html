more involved
still not too bad but it requires a bit
more code so we start off by
initializing the splay tree and we have
a few variables here to keep track of
the current min and Max as we are going
through and we check whether the empty
splay tree is actually empty that is as
empty method returns true and similarly
for Fineman and fine Max and senti there
can't be any min and Max and that when
we search an empty splay tree that we
also returned on now we insert 100 in
here and set the current min and Max to
be 100 just to initialize the tree to
something and now we go through and for
10 examples we check whether the tree is
empty and it shouldn't be then we insert
it insert a new key into the splay tree
for range 10 through 20 twice just to
see if that works ok update current
minimum current max now we check that
that has been inserted by trying to find
it in the splay tree and we start that
that should be found and it shouldn't
find should return the current of the
for loop as found and this is what we
assert here now we check the min and the
max the max shouldn't change since we're
going from 10 to 20 and we've already
inserted a 100 but the men should change
each time so this should test the find
min function right here and now we do
the same thing except we try to remove
and we just try to remove these assert
that it's not empty and that we don't
find after removing the key the key in
the splay tree because it shouldn't be
in there anymore and then just as a
little aside here we try to insert 373
and remove it to see what happens this
is really not too involved you could
have gotten quite a bit more advanced
with this this should do everything you
need to do so if we run this we said we
got it right so I hope you had fun with
us sorry about the bug that was in there
initially and thank you to everyone who
caught that my fault entirely so other
than that I hope you enjoyed this I hope
it showed you what coverage can and
can't do and after this we'll be moving
on to random testing which I hope you'll
also really enjoy thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
