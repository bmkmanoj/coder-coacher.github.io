than three if you have trouble
remembering the less than symbol
remember that the arrow points to the
left or two numbers less than zero i
know i need a parenthesis because i
can't be equal to so it must be the
number line to our number line for i
want numbers lower than three because x
is less than three so it must be four
for the interval notation I want numbers
that are from negative infinity all the
way up to three so that must be be for X
greater than or equal to 3 I want to use
a bracket that's number line one the
interval notation would be D because I
can be equal to three and then have any
number bigger or up to positive infinity
here i have 3 is greater than or equal
to x I'm used to seeing the variable on
the left side so I'm going to flip this
inequality around I didn't make sure
that the arrow still points to the X
when I switch this inequality round I
want three to be greater than or equal
to X and I want X to be less than or
equal to 3 for the number line it must
be number three I need a bracket at
three and my values could be less than
or equal to 3 the interval notation
would be a I could have numbers from
negative infinity all the way up and
equal to 3 this must mean that the last
one is to see I want number is greater
than three hero number is greater than
three and here are numbers between 3 and
positive infinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
