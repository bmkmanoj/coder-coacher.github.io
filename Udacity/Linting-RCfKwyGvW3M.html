your JavaScript code for errors and it
can be done at various stages during
development very your editor your build
process or your pre-commit hook in
version control there's not always a
right or wrong way in lending a lot of
it is heavily opinionated so you should
choose the configuration that fits your
coding style and project there's also
the difference of code style lending
versus syntax or structural lending
syntax are structural linting is what
most people refer to when they say
lending these rules check for JavaScript
anti patterns such as unreachable
statements or forgetting to do a strict
comparison against null on the other
hand code style lending can complain
about things such as variables that
aren't properly camel cased are a
particular way of placing braces for
function so if linting ensures your code
looks sexy and checks for all these
potential errors does that mean your
code will always run if the lender is
happy nope
the lender only checks for potential
errors it doesn't actually have any idea
what you're trying to accomplish so now
that you're familiar with the concept of
linting let's talk solutions there are
three popular JavaScript lenders out
there that developers use GS hint J SCS
and es lint you'll find a link in the
notes that details the differences but
to cut it short we'll stick with es lint
as it supports modern es6 code can be
extended and has output that's really
easy to understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
