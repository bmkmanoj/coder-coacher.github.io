payoff profile that strictly dominates
the min/max or security level profile
can be realized as a Nash equilibrium
payoff profile with a sufficiently large
discount factor proven what we're going
to do is we're going to construct a way
of behaving where both players are going
to play so that they achieve this
feasible profile and the reason to make
that a Nash equilibrium what we need to
do is make it so that it's a best
response and the way that we're going to
make it a best response is we're gonna
say do what you're told
to follow you follow your instructions
to achieve that feasible payoff and if
you don't then the other player is going
to attack you it's going to adopt a
strategy that forces you down to your
min Max or your security level and
that's your threat so the best response
to that threat is to just go along and
and and do what you're told to achieve
that feasible payoff the only way that
that's going to be stable though is if
the thing that you're asked to do the
feasible payoff is better than the min
max right because that has to be a
threat you can't threaten somebody and
say you know do this or I'm gonna give
you candy it's got to be do this or I'm
gonna do so give you something that's
less pleasant than what I've asked you
to do okay that actually makes sense
yeah so this is a really cool idea hey
could you try saying that again but with
like a southern accent
just the folk theorem part any feasible
payoff profile that strictly dominates
the min max security level profile can
be realized as a Nash equilibrium payoff
profile with sufficiently large discount
factor I like that because now it's a
folksy theorem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
