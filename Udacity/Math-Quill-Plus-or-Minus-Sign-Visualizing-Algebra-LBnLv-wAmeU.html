the in througt and a space this will
create this radical symbol your cursor
bar will appear here and you'll need to
hit the right arrow key and then type in
five to get what's underneath the
radical these would be the keystrokes
for our third expression notice that
after we type in the square root symbol
we don't need to hit the right arrow key
that's because the index for this root
is assumed to be a two it's rare that
you'll ever see it but we know it's a
square root that's why it's a two math
cool noses too and so you're just placed
back inside the radical and then you can
type in 21 now for this last expression
you might not have any idea what I is
that's okay we're going to cover this
later to start this expression I would
type in a forward slash this would
create an entire fraction with a spot
for a numerator and a denominator we
type in these keystrokes in order to get
our entire numerator and notice that our
cursor bar is here once we type in the
six our cursor bar will appear here and
we hit the right arrow key twice in
order to move it down to the denominator
then we just type a four to wrap up our
expression now there are other ways that
you could have done this to create the
fraction bar you could have created the
fraction bar after the six but that
means this forward slash would go in
between these two errors after you type
the six you're still inside the radical
so if you type the forward slash here
you'll create a fraction within the
radical you don't want that to happen so
you hit the right arrow key once which
moves the cursor bar outside of the
radical and then you can type a forward
slash to create your fraction hit the
right arrow key again to move to the
denominator and then under four to
finish up either way you do this last
one is correct
I just want you to get comfortable using
