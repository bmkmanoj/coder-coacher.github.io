absolute threshold competition for we
testing to see how high pitch our
contestants could hear and now we're
going to go to another absolute
threshold competition but this time
we're going to measure how quiet of a
sound our contestants can perceive let's
go to you Susan hi guys this event is
similar to our pitch event except we're
going to be measuring volume we're going
to start with 60 decibels which is about
the sound of the average speaking voice
so hopefully everybody will hear that
and raise their hands then we're going
to lower it to 50 40 30 decibels which
is about the sound of a whisper we'll
keep lowering those until there's only
one contestant remaining it looks like
they're ready to start I need to clear
the floor thanks Susan
we're going to let you keep an eye on
things there this is really exciting
I wonder how low the volume will go
Susan mentioned that 60 decibels is the
volume of normal speaking and 30
decibels is the volume of a whisper so
what do you think will be the lowest
volume that our contestants will be able
to hear well Annie I would say a whisper
is a lot quieter than normal
conversation so maybe 25 decibels
actually it's probably going to be a lot
closer to 0-0
isn't that no sound at all so not quite
decibels are funny unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
