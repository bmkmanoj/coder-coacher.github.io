an if statement because we want to make
a decision we want to test if the start
link is equal to negative one so that
means that we did not find what we were
looking for find returns negative one so
if the value of start link is negative
one well then we don't want to do the
rest we don't have a URL to look for
what we want to do is return the special
value none and zero so that's the change
now when we run this with this string
that does not have a link what we get as
the output for the URL is none we can't
tell that that's not a string the way it
prints out but it's different from a
string and one thing that we can do with
none it's sort of like false so if the
value of the test expression in an F is
none that's treated the same way as
false so if you RL returned here is none
then we'll print not here I guess that
means we're here but we're not here so
here's what we get so we see that we got
not here when we passed in a string that
did not contain a link tag if we go back
to the string that has a link tag and
now we run the code we'll see that the
URL was some string that's treated as
true and we get the print here so the
test condition for a boolean doesn't
necessarily have to be just true or
false
Python will interpret different values
as true and false and the important
thing here is that any string value
other than empty string is treated as
true and we'll go through this part of
the if the value none is treated as
false and we'll go to the else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
