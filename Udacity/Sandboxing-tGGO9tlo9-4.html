approved source iOS enforces security
measures designed to prevent it from
compromising other apps or the rest of
the system all third-party apps are sent
boxed so that they are restricted from
assessing files stored by other apps or
from making changes to the device this
prevents apps from gathering or
modifying information stored by other
apps each app has a unique home
directory for its files which is
randomly assigned when the app is
installed if a third-party app needs to
access information other than its own it
does so only by using services
explicitly provided by iOS system files
and resources are also suited from
user's apps the majority of iOS as well
as the third-party apps run as an
unprivileged user mobile the entire OS
partition is mounted as read-only
unnecessary tools such as remote login
services are not included in a system
software the iOS API is to not allow
apps to escalate their own provisions to
modify other apps iOS itself to
summarize by sandboxing a third-party
app each app has its unique directory
and can access its own files any access
to other files will be restricted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
