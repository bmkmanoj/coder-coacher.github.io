transition function and we don't have
the reward function either so the robot
or the trader or whatever environment
we're in has to interact with the world
observe what happens and work with that
data to try to build a policy so let me
give you an example here let's say we
were in state s1 so that's what we
observed there our robot took action a1
I'm making this little subscript to
indicate that which step in this series
of steps it's at we then find ourselves
in s prime and we get reward R now this
is an experienced tuple this is very
similar to experienced tuples in
regression learning where we have a x
and a y paired together
that's an experienced tuple of you know
when you observe this X you see this Y
here we're saying when you observe this
state s1 you take action a1 you end up
in this new state at least it's an
example of you ending up in this new
state s1 Prime and reward r1 now we find
ourselves in a new state s2 but that's
really this state that's where we found
herself we take some new action a to
wind up in some new state s2 prime and
we get a new reward r2 and we do this
over and over and over and over and over
again gathering experience tuples all
along the way now if we have this trail
of experienced tuples there's two things
we can do with them in order to find
that policy PI the first set of
approaches is called model based
reinforcement learning what we do is we
look at this data over time and we build
a model of T just by looking
statistically at these transitions in
other words we can look at every time we
were in a particular state and took a
particular action and see which new
states we ended up in and just build a
tabular representation of that it's it's
not
similarly we can build a model of our we
just look statistically when we're in a
particular state and we take an action
what's the reward and we can just
average that over over all these
instances once we have these models we
can then use value iteration or policy
iteration to solve the problem there's
another set of approaches called model
free and that's the type that we're
going to focus on and in particular
we're gonna learn about Q learning and
model free methods develop a policy just
directly by looking at the data and of
course we'll talk about those soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
