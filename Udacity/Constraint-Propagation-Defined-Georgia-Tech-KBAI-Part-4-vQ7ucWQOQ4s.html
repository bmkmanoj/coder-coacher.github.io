constraint propagation constraint
propagation is a method of inference
that assigns values to variables
characterizing a problem such a way that
some conditions are satisfied so if you
have any problem that problem is going
to be characterized by some variables
and the task is to give specific values
to each variable in such a way that some
global constraints have been satisfied
so given a problem so problems are
characterized by a set of variables each
variable may locally take on some value
however the question is how can we
locally assign values to variables in
such a way that some global constraints
are satisfied as an example it is
returned to this figure here is a figure
drawn on a 2d surface and the problem is
whether or not it represents a 3d object
the variables here are the surfaces and
the orientations one could consider this
to be a single two-dimensional surface
with some lines drawn on it
alternatively one can think of this as
having four surfaces 1 2 3 4 where each
surface has a particular orientation the
orientation can be specified by the
perpendicular to that surface the
metalic constraint propagation is going
to help identify these surfaces and
their orientations the constraints here
are defined by these junctions for
trihedral objects where three surfaces
meet at a particular point these
junctions have certain properties no
matter how we assign these surfaces and
the orientations the assignment must
satisfy all of those constraints we'll
look at the details of constraint
propagation in a minute but first notice
there are two possible interpretations
to this particular 3d object one can
look at it as if when were looking
inside a box alternatively one can look
at it as if one were looking at a
building this means that constraint
propagation need not necessarily always
succeed and disambiguating between
different kind of assignments of
surfaces and the orientations sometimes
multiple interpretations can
simultaneously satisfy all the
constraints it is also possible that no
assignment of values with variables will
satisfy all the constraints in which
case the interpretation becomes very
difficult as another example that is
examined the sentence colorless green
ideas sleep furiously
all of us can recognize that this is
semantically meaningless but
grammatically correct how did we know
that it suit grammatically correct the
variables here are the various lexical
categories like verbs and nouns and
subjects and predicates the values are
the assignments we make to these various
words here is green a noun is green of
world a green a determiner is it part of
a subject a part of a predicate the
constraints here are defined with the
rules of English language grammar as we
assign values of the various variables
here that assignment must satisfy the
constraints on English language grammar
so that as we assign values to these
variables those assignments must satisfy
the constraints on English language
grammar before we can accept this
sentence to be dramatically correct if
this sentence was grammatically not
correct then we will not be able to
assign values to all the variables in a
way that will satisfy the constraints
imposed by the English language grammar
so we've actually come across this idea
of constraints an English language
grammar before during our lesson on
understanding we talked about how a
preposition for example can constrain
the meaning of the word that follows it
if we see the word from for example we
expect what comes after it to be some
kind of source for the sentence there we
used grammatical constraints in service
of some kind of semantic analysis here
we're just using grammatical constraints
to figure out if a sentence is
grammatically correct or not there's
another connection here to understanding
as well Ashok talked about how we can
interpret this shape as either popping
out towards us or down into the screen
we talked about to simultaneously
accurate interpretations of the same
thing in understanding with regard to
sentences that can be read as puns so
for example when I said it's hard to
explain puns to kleptomaniacs because
they always take things literally the
word take can simultaneously be
interpreted as interpret and physically
remove while satisfying all the
constraints of the sentence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
