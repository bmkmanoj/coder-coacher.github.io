instance of the discrete Fourier
transform which as we've said has its
own significance in various branches of
mathematics physics and engineering
signal processing most especially in the
study of algorithms however the fast
Fourier transform is most interesting
for its role in a very practical and
very fast way of convolving to sequences
of numbers will illustrate convolution
by an example we're given two sequences
of numbers shown here we'll call them a
and B and we want to obtain a new
sequence defined by this formula here
where the K element in the sequence is
the sum from 0 to K over I of AI times B
sub K minus I we can visualize
convolution by reversing the order of B
and lining it up with a so that the 0th
element of B is under the K element of a
this is the alignment for K equals 0
then we multiply all elements that
overlap and add up these products for K
equals 0 this is 2 times 1 which is 2 so
we'll write down that c0 is equal to 2
for cake was 1 we shift the sequence
over multiply the corresponding elements
and add those up that's a total of 0 and
that becomes C 1 for K equals 2 we shift
the B sequence over again multiply the
corresponding elements and add them up
for a total of 5 and we continue sliding
B along doing these products and then
summing all things together and we keep
doing this until there is no more
overlap left convolution has many
applications but the one that will be
most convenient for us to talk about is
multiplying polynomials given two
coefficients of polynomials we can find
the coefficients of the product just by
convolving the two sequences of
coefficients in fact we can easily
repeat the example we just did but in
the context of polynomial multiplication
first I line things up so that we get
the constant terms and that product is 2
then we line them up so that we get the
linear terms
zero times X then we line them up so we
get the quadratic terms five times x
squared and so forth and so on
how long does this process take well for
each element in the longer sequence we
had to do as many multiplications and
additions as there are elements in the
shorter sequences sometimes it was a
little short around the edges because
the shorter one ran off the edge of the
longer one but on average it was at
least about half therefore we can say
that convolving two sequences via the
naive strategy outlined here takes data
in tons m operations where N and M are
the lengths of the sequences the Fourier
transform will give us a way to improve
on this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
