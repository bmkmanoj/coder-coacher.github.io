this idea we've got a little flight
graph from one of the previous examples
and we can compute the clustering
coefficient for any node let's say no to
we're going to print the clustering
coefficient for node 2 and then what
we're going to do is actually randomly
pick two of these neighbors now I ended
up having to go a little bit crazy here
because we need to pick the neighbors
without replacement meaning that we pick
one neighbor and then the second
neighbor we pick has to be different
from the first one so I went out of my
way a little bit and said okay here's
what we're going to do we're going to
run through all of the neighbors of vvs2
and for each of them we're going to
stick them into an array called V index
and so instead of randomly choosing from
this set we're going to randomly choose
indices from this array and that'll make
it easier to make sure we don't repeat
so d is going to be the degree of node V
and as long as that degree is greater
than 1 we're going to pick a random
neighbor so that now neighbor here being
chosen by its ordering from 0 to D minus
1 so v1 is the neighbor the actual node
name associated with that pick and then
we do a second pick and this time we're
going to do we're going to again choose
from 1 to d minus 1 we're going to add
that to the pic that we already got with
modulo d to make it wrap around so this
is going to make sure that we're going
to pick something that is different from
what we just picked and we look up the
corresponding ID so we've got v1 and v2
or the two neighbors we check whether
they're connected and we add one to the
total if they are we repeat this whole
loop a thousand times and at each point
in time we take the total the total
number of times things were connected
divided by the total number we tried and
I can aim that it ought to be the case
that this number converges to the actual
clustering coefficient so let's try it
so in this particular case the
clustering coefficient for node V is 0
point 3 and now let's what let's watch
what happens to the estimate well
certainly when there's only one sample
that we've done so far it's either going
to be 1 or 0 it's not going to be very
close to 0 point 3 but as we repeat this
over and over again you can see it's
kind of settling in actually hit point 3
briefly the 40th try but it's kind of
bouncing around a little bit above 3 a
little bit below 3 and the longer we run
this the kind of less it seems to be
changing point to 6.2 7.26 point 270 it
wandered up 2.3 again and ended up at
point three one so
if we do this long enough or repeat this
enough times what we'll find is that the
number really is point three but it on a
given run it's going to be a little bit
more a little bit less the longer that
it runs the more digits are going to be
correct and so in this particular case
this is a terrible approximation because
it's actually not very close to the real
answer and it took us a long time to get
this extremely bad answer there's some
nice mathematical tricks like the
Chernoff bound that tells us how many
times we have to do a random sample as a
function of the variance of the
distribution before we can get an
estimate of a particular level of
accuracy with a particular level of
certainty so if you want to be really
careful about this you can actually look
up the turnoff down and apply it to
figure out how many samples are needed
but for current purposes you know run it
as long as you can run it and hope for
the best all right so that's that's
really all I wanted to go over in unit 5
and and then we pick it up again in unit
6 talking about computational complexity
and its relation to social network
analysis see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
