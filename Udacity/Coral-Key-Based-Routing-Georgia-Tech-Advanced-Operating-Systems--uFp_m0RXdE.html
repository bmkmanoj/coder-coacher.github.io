different approach in the coral
key-based routing rather than being
greedy we are going to slowly progress
towards our desired destination in
particular I mentioned that the distance
between two nodes in the node namespace
is given by the XOR of the node IDs so
in particular if I look at the source 14
here and the destination for here we can
compute the XOR distance between the
source and the desired destination and
the routing table now is populated with
numbers and what these numbers show is
the XOR distance from any particular
node to the desired destination so the
XOR distance from my source which is 14
to the destination which is 4 is 10 the
XOR distance from the node whose ID is
13 and the destination is 4 is 9 and
similarly the XOR distance from the node
whose ID is 5 and the destination 4 is 1
so what I have now in my routing table
is the XOR distance of the desired
destination that's what I have in this
entry of the routing table that says
what is the XOR distance for my desired
destination right now from each of the
guys that I know how to get to directly
I know how to get to 13 I know how to
get to 3 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 5 and what I'm
looking at now is if I get to 13 what is
the distance of that guy from the
desired destination what is the distance
of this guy from the desired destination
and so on that's what your stable
entries are showing right now these are
the notes that are directly reachable
from me and what they are showing is the
XOR distance of each of the nodes that
are directly reachable from me to the
desired destination
so in coral what we're going to do is in
each harp
I'm going to go to some node that is
half the distance to the destination in
the node ID namespace recall in the
greedy approach since I have a way of
getting to node number five I directly
went to him with the hope that he'll get
me to my desired destination
not so in coral key-based routing what
we're gonna do is in each hop we're
going to go to some node that is half
the distance to the destination in the
node ID namespace now the XOR distance
between the source and the destination
14 + 4 is 10 so in the first hop I'll go
to a node that is half the distance to
my desired destination desire
destination being 10 I want to go to a
node number five second half I want to
go to a node that is half the distance
of five that is too distant from the
desired destination and third hop I want
to go to a node that is one distant that
is finally I'm home so that's the idea
behind the coral key-based routing but
of course when I have a particular
distance metric like ten in this case
and I want to go half the distance in
the first hop I may not have a direct
way of reaching the guy who is half the
distance to the desired node so let's
see how actually coral key-based routing
works given this particular example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
