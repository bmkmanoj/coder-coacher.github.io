on refactoring by telling you when you
should not refactor one first clear case
is when your code is broken I want to
make it very clear refactoring is not a
way to fix your code in terms of its
functionality it's a way to improve the
design of your code so if your code does
not compile or does not run in a stable
way it's probably better to throw it
away and rewrite it rather than trying
to refactor it by definition refactoring
should maintain the functionality of the
system should be behavior preserving so
if the code was broken before it's
probably gonna be broken afterwards as
well you may also want to avoid
refactoring when a deadline is close
well first of all because refactoring
might take a long time and therefore
might introduce risks of being late for
the deadline and also because of what we
said before about introducing promise
you don't want to introduce problems
that might take you time to fix right
before a deadline so if the data needs
to close you might want to avoid
refactoring the code at that point and
finally do not refactor if there is no
reason to as we said before you should
refactor on demand you see a problem
with the design of your code with the
structure of your code it's ok to
refactor if the code is fine there is no
reason to refactor I know the
refactoring is fun but you don't want to
do it all the time the next thing I want
to discuss after discussing when not to
refactor is when to refactor we're not
the indication that will tell us that
it's time to refactor the code and that
leads us to the discussion of a very
interesting concept</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
