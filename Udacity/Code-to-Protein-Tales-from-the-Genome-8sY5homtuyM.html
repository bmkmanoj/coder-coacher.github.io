with proteins performing all kinds of
functions that make up the basis for
your traits okay but where does the
protein originally come from right so we
finally come to the the whole point of
this right it comes from the genetic
instructions inside the cells of your
body inside the nucleus you have two
copies of your genome one from mom and
one from dad six billion letters of
information took a lot of information
how does it get turned into something
else' well this is when it's time for us
to think about our genome book again not
like just a book but a book of recipes
you've got lots of recipes to make up
who you are we don't need all of them
right now we just want to focus on blood
type so I may have the blood type recipe
for Type A and you have the blood type
recipe for Type B maybe a better way of
doing this is to actually go ahead and
you know you know get a real recipe out
here well yeah we'll be pretty audacious
about this and I want to give you this
example of a recipe that Lauren this was
a recipe from your grandmother okay
let's start simple with the recipe we
see here what food is this most likely
going to make now I'm gonna read out the
recipe really quick our measurements are
very American centric so we're not using
the scientific metric system here but
we're gonna take our first six
ingredients and mix them well a cup of
butter 4 eggs a cup of milk 2 cups of
sugar two and a half cups of flour a
teaspoon of baking powder and we're
gonna mix it all together and is one of
our later ingredients we're gonna have
one tube of blue icing well pour this
into a pan and bake at 375 degrees
Fahrenheit for 20 minutes then we'll
remove it from the pan cool and then we
can add our icing so tell me what food
is this likely a recipe for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
