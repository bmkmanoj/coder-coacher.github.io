about warping and we're going to get
into a lot more detail about this in the
next lecture so here basically I'm just
showing you two images right so I have a
point here and I want to generate a
larger point which has been rotated in
the new word image space where the
domain is X prime Y prime so this is my
coordinate axis and of course I have my
transformation so take this pixel and I
warp it to this location here so in
essence what we're doing is sending each
pixel from F XY to its corresponding
location where the transformation T X in
the second image what happens if the new
pixel lands between two pixels remember
if this couldn't be much bigger in this
open space that we're coming up with in
essence we're taking a bigger image and
filling in information from there and
the forward mapping what's really done
is that we would distribute the color
among the neighborhood pixels so this is
the pixel I have there when it shows up
there I'll kind of distribute the color
in the ones around it to generate a new
pixel and that's what I would actually
do this would be for warping process
another well-known process is when we
actually go inverse backward warping
again I take a pixel from here and I
want to go and figure out the inverse
transformation to find where would
actually land up and what would I do
with it so again in this what I'll do is
take each pixel from the Warped image
and find its corresponding location and
move it to a new image as long as I know
the inverse again in this case what
happens if it shows up in between pixels
it's in this case what we would do is
basically we will interpolate the color
values that was where we were
distributing here we would interpolate
the color values and fill it in here
from the neighbors again how do we do
this interpolation remember how we did
things like filtering images and stuff
like that we could use those types of
methods to help us do this just to do a
quick comparison forward versus inverse
warping which one do you think is better
well usually inverse mapping is a better
method because it eliminates holes
they're always going from something we
know how to get to to much more of an
original image and of course that allows
us to fill in all the color information
if we sometimes go from one to the other
we might run into places where we don't
have to we'll have to do some sort of
hole filling
I'll talk a little bit about that when
we talk about more thing but the impor
partes to do inverse warping we need an
invertible warp function now I want you
all to think about how we would actually
create an invertible warp function based
on what we have talked about before and
see that in some instances especially
for rigid warps and stuff like that
that's the easily computable inverse
function especially when you have
rotations and translations and even
scales it does get harder and do a bunch
other things and not all the times
especially when you do have not a global
warp it gets harder and harder to
compute those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
