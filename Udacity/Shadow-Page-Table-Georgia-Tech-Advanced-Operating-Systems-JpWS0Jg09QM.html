shadow page table where it is in many
architectures for example Intel's x86
family the CPU uses the page table for
address translation what that means is
presented with a virtual address the CPU
gets to work it first looks up the TLB
to see if there is a match for the
virtual page number contained in this
virtual address if there is a match it's
a hit and it can translate this virtual
address to physical address if it is a
mess CPU knows where in memory the page
table data structure is kept by the
operating system and therefore what it
does it goes to the page table which is
in main memory and retrieves the
specific entry which will give it the
translation from the virtual page number
is a physical page number and once it
gets that it will stash it in the TLB as
well and be able to generate the
physical address that is specified by
this particular virtual address so
that's the way the CPU does the
translation in many architectures so in
other words both the TLB and the page
table are data structures that the
architecture uses for address
translation page table is also a data
structure that is set by the operating
system for enabling the processor to do
this translation so in other words the
hardware page tables really the shadow
page table in the virtualized setting if
the architecture is going to use the
page table for address translation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
