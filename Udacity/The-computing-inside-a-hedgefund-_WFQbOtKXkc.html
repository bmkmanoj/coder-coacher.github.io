computationally demanding environments I
know of they have infrastructure
requirements like huge databases
significant network connectivity low
latency and high bandwidth connectivity
real time processing and so on I want to
show you as an example the typical kinds
of computing that goes on inside the
hedge fund to motivate you for this
class in other words this isn't exactly
the way all hedge funds work but this is
just to give you a taste for how many
hedge funds work and you'll see I think
that computing and computational
capabilities are core here so we're
gonna work backwards from the market
back towards the sort of back office of
the hedge fund the way things work are
we have a certain portfolio that is
which stocks we have and whether we're
in positive or negative positions with
regard to them the trading algorithm
here is central it's interacting with
the market observing the live portfolio
and what it's trying to do is to get
this live portfolio to match some target
portfolio so somewhere further back
inside the hedge fund we've decided what
this target portfolio ought to look like
in other words how many shares of Apple
how many shares of Delta Airlines we
should have and so on and this trading
algorithm is trying to get us there so
it's comparing target with live and then
to move this portfolio towards that
target its issuing orders so it sends
orders like buy 200 shares of Apple to
the market those orders get executed or
not and that updates the live portfolio
now one reason this kind of trading
algorithm is important is you don't want
to execute everything at once in other
words suppose we wanted to take a very
very large position in Apple if we were
just to send an order hey buy me
million shares of Apple that would
affect us detrimental II in the sense
that the price for Apple would probably
rise and we would not get a good
execution
so this trading algorithm takes those
sorts of things into consideration as it
moves our live portfolio to be more
close to the target portfolio in fact
sometimes it takes days to enter a
particular position so this doesn't
necessarily happen all at once and
there's many many different types of
trading algorithms that have been
invented to solve these problems now
let's step one step back into the
computing of a hedge fund and look at
how we arrive at this target portfolio
here's that target portfolio and here is
some of the data and computing that
could go into computing that target
portfolio so from somewhere machine
learning perhaps we have a forecast of
what stock prices are going to be at
some time in the future and that can of
course drive what our target portfolio
ought to be for today in other words if
we're forecasting that BAC is going to
go up this might represent that we think
it's going to go up 5% we might want to
increase our holdings in that if we
think that Apple for instance is going
to go down we might want to decrease our
holdings so this forecast informs this
algorithm called a portfolio optimizer
that works to balance the risks and
rewards for a balanced portfolio that
considers volatility and correlation
between different stocks and so on we're
going to talk a lot about portfolio
optimization later in this course some
other considerations that go into
portfolio optimizer are historical data
open high/low close and volume we can
look at that historical data to inform
how stocks are correlated or
uncorrelated to one another and also of
critical importance is our
current portfolio it may be the case
that if we're holding something we don't
want to exit it immediately because we'd
be penalized by you know rapidly selling
it
so this optimizer takes all this
information into account to get to the
target portfolio that our trading
algorithm is working to drive us towards
now one more stop along our road here at
the computing infrastructure of a hedge
fund is to look at how do we come up
with this in day forecast by n you know
in might be 5 days or 10 days or
whatever so here's this in day forecast
and we've got some kind of forecasting
algorithm this is very often in the form
of a model in fact a machine-learning
based model and creating these sorts of
forecasting algorithms using machine
learning is a focus of the last mini
course in this group of many courses
anyhow how do we get to this forecast
well we've usually got some sort of
proprietary information again historical
data and our forecaster crunches all
that data to build a model and create a
forecast so bringing it all together
that's the computing in a hedge fund and
we've also spent some time talking about
what might motivate you as a hedge fund
manager that's it for this lesson I'll
talk to you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
