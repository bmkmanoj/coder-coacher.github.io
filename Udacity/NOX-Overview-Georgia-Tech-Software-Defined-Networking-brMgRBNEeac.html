in the course is actually an example of
network virtualization we are in fact
running a an entire virtual network on
your laptop when you start meaning it
using the MN script each host in the
virtual network is a bash process with
its own network namespace a network
namespace is kind of like a virtual
machine except it's a lot more
lightweight it's in fact called os-level
virtualization so each one of these
virtual nodes has its own view of the
network stack as shown here with these
interfaces but it has a shared file
system and it's not in fact running its
own independent virtual machine the root
namespace manages the communication
between these distinct virtual notes as
well as the switch that connects these
nodes in the topology that you set up
virtual Ethernet pairs are assigned to
namespaces for example s1e1 is assigned
to an interface in h2s network name
space and s1e2 is assigned to a network
namespace in h 3's virtual network
namespace the open flow switch
effectively performs forwarding between
the interfaces in the root namespace but
because the interfaces are paired we get
the illusion of sending traffic between
h2 and h3 when we make modifications to
the open flow switch via the controller
were in fact doing that in the root
namespace in summary virtual networks
facilitate flexible agile deployment by
enabling rapid innovation at the pace of
software vendor independence and scale
we talked about the distinction between
SDNS and virtual networks as well as
various technologies that enable virtual
networks such as virtual machines for
creating virtual nodes and tunneling for
creating virtual links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
