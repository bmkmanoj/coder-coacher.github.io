for the sake of simplicity what I want
to do is I want to categorize these
ideas into a few buckets for instance
ideas like how to add buttons and how to
add text they are all a very visible
part of the app let's call this category
view when we are going to build that app
we will also need to save some data this
for us will be the audio file that we
can playback let's put that in another
category and call that category data or
model and finally we will write some
code to control the view and the model
here we will need to change the speed of
the recorded audio and we will also need
to learn how to transition between
different screens we can call this
category controller now a good analogy
here would be from the world of theater
you can think of a view as actors actors
are the most visible part of a play a
controller is like a director who
manages or controls things on a set and
finally you can think of the model as
the backstage area where they store
props that are needed for the play so
what you're seeing here is the beginning
of a design pattern called model view
and controller or MVC for short that
Apple wants programmers to follow when
they are making apps in fact most apps
on the app store follow this sort of a
design and so will be you will begin to
see this design pattern as soon as we
make our app so let's do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
