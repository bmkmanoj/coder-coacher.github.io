no fun at all I want to see my web page
I don't want to wait an infinite number
of seconds and then see my web page
that's pretty long i would get hungry
before that ran out wouldn't it be nice
if we could just tell if a program was
going to loop forever or not and then if
it's going to loop forever i won't run
it or i'll print a little warning on the
web page now but i won't waste a lot of
time on it so what I'd really like to do
is just look at the program source code
as we got it from the website and just
be able to tell if it loops forever in
one of these infinite loops or if it
halts if it stops if it settles down and
returns an answer after some finite
amount of time this seems like a totally
legitimate request unfortunately it's
not just difficult it's actually
impossible provably impossible not
really hard we're too lazy we couldn't
figure it out but we know you can't do
it you can't make this determination
correctly every time to see why this
can't happen let's assume we could solve
it and see what bad things happen to the
world let's assume that we have thought
very hard about this and we have somehow
implemented a magic procedure called
halts which takes another procedure as
an argument and returns true if that
procedure halts and false if it loops
forever now we know if it's safe to
evaluate a web page we just look at all
the JavaScript on the web page we call
halts on it if that returns true every
time we can totally render that web page
let's test our understanding of this
mythical halts procedure over here on
the left I've written four bits of
Python code vladimir nabokov pale and
fire and fire is in red because that's
warm one possibility is that we think
Vladimir halts and other possibility is
that we think Nabokov halts what I'd
like you to do is tell me which of these
four statements there could be multiple
are actually true check each box that
corresponds to a true fact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
