drawing and that's text text is actually
a super complicated topic so we're just
going to do the minimum necessary to get
some text on the screen first thing text
in libgdx is actually made of bitmaps
that means instead of describing the
shape of the characters we describe the
actual pixels that make up the text will
discuss bitmaps and textures in more
detail later on but the short version is
just that we use a spritebatch instead
of a shape renderer everything else is
almost identical so in this demo we'll
create our spritebatch and we'll use
just the default bitmap font then we'll
set the scale so the font appears a
little bit bigger and then we need to
set the filter now text you're filtering
is a complicated topic all on its own
we'll talk more about that later but
it's how we determine what a bitmap
looks like when the bitmap gets drawn at
a larger size than it was originally
designed to be drawn at this linear
filter make sure that the text doesn't
look all pixelated when we draw at large
sprite batches and fonts need to be
disposed of just like a shape renderer
finally down and render we clear the
screen just like normal we begin a batch
of the spritebatch just like with a
shape renderer except there's no mode
then to actually draw we call draw on
the font object passing in the batch the
text we want to draw and the position
also remember to end your sprite batches
and there we go we've got text on the
screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
