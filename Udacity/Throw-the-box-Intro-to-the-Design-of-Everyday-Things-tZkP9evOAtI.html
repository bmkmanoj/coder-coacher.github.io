how come how what made it possible to
catch well it was light enough it was
crippled yeah it's about the right size
so we call those features affordances
it's about the right size you can flip
it around you can throw it and catch it
and you know you can even hide behind it
because it doesn't afford the
transmission of light so which is very
important well thank you hey there's
something inside how do you know well I
heard something inside when I shook it
and that means that I have a model that
that there's a object we call those
conceptual models oh is it a gift opiate
what are you looking for I'm looking for
something that tells me I can open it
because this lid doesn't open ah there's
a tab here that tells me something it's
slid out aha it signifies that you can
open it there and we call that a
signifier oh you shouldn't have
it's okay i'm kristance I'm sorry and
I'm Don Willy and I'm Chelsey Glasson
and together we'll be teaching the
design of everyday things look around
you everything is designed if you
thought a designer was the one who
helped you choose curtains then we'll
show you that it's broader and deeper
it's about how things look how they work
and just as importantly how they make
you feel and we're going to give you the
scientific principles behind good design
the things that make it understandable
you already know three affordances
signifiers and conceptual models will
also help you take the first steps in
designing the world around you yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
