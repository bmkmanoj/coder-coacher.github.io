finally ready you're mature enough to
learn the whole truth about how four
statements actually work you've been
using them all along but you may not
have known the inner details the gory
truth about what's inside a for
statement now when I say forex and items
print X probably have a model that looks
something like this assuming items is a
list or a tuple or a string you think of
this code probably is something like i
equals 0 while i is less than the length
of the items x equals items at I and
then print X and that's a good model as
long as items is one of these sequence
types like lists but items can also be
other things as we've seen it can be a
generator expression for example overall
Python calls the thing that can be
iterated over in a for loop an iterable
and so strings and lists are examples of
iterable and so our generators and what
actually happens when we implement this
piece of code it's as if we had written
this code so first we take the items and
we make an iterator from them by calling
the built-in function hitter I'm going
to call that yet and then we're going to
have a while loop that goes forever it's
loop control says well true we're going
to assign X to be the next item off of
the iterator then do whatever was in the
body of the for loop in this case print
X so we're going to keep on doing this
sequence as long as we can get an x
value but when next stops then we'll
have an exception which is a stop
iteration exception and we don't need to
do anything more we're done and so
that's what a for loop really means in
Python we take the items we create an
iterator over them we call that iterator
until we're done and then we pass
through to the next statement we're
finally ready to define this see this
counting function what it does is it
takes a sequence it says this is the
first time I've been called so I'm going
to initialize my starts to one and then
i'm going to enter into a loop and this
is means that c is
a generator function the generator
function will be returned and as part of
the four protocol will call that
generator function each time we want the
next item in the sequence and each time
we do that our count of items will be
incremented when we're done when the for
loop doesn't want anymore we'll stop
incrementing and so we don't necessarily
go through every item in the sequence
will just have just the right number of
counts for item and so this will give us
the right number of starts and the right
number of items we can do that because
we control the time of execution because
this is a generator function and not a
regular function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
