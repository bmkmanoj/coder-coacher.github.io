of paper is going to make the box of the
biggest volume but in order to really
visualize that you have to put the boxes
together so let's start out by doing
that
okay so now we have three boxes and it
time to make use of our Eminem's now
okay so I filled each of these boxes
with Eminem's as best I can fortunately
i ran out over here probably because i
ate some of them but I think we can
already tell just by looking at the
dimensions of this little skinny box
that its volume is definitely less than
the other two boxes it's so flat it
can't possibly be the biggest so now
we're left with two choices now I could
go through and count every single Eminem
in this box and every single Eminem in
this box but I'm kind of lazy and I
would take a really long time so I will
tell you that when I filled these
Eminem's took me several more handfuls
of Eminem's to fill this box lend to
this box something's that it's pretty
good guessed that this one has more
volume however as with many things you
seen in this course think we're going to
need to do some math to find a more
rigorous way of analyzing the volume of
any kind of box that we can make out a
piece of paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
