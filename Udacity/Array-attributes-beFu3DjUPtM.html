attributes that describes it in addition
to the elements it contains one of the
most useful one is shape essentially a
tuple containing the number of rows and
columns or height and width of the array
we have already seen how to specify this
when creating arrays the shape of the
array a would be Phi rows and four
columns so this is your array now let's
see how to access the shape of the given
array by using the shape attribute a dot
shape will give you the shape of the
array let's run it area dot shape will
return you a tuple with the first value
specifying the number of rows and the
second value specifying the number of
columns next we will learn how to
individually access number of rows or
number of columns a dot shape zero would
return the number of rows and a dot
shape one would return the number of
columns
let's check the output here you see that
the number of rows are correctly
extracted as five and number of columns
as four if you have more dimensions you
will have additional elements in the
shape double the number of dimensions in
an array can be found by simply asking
for the length of this tuple a dot shape
will return a tuple and the length of
the tuple would inform us what is the
dimension of the array it rightly tells
us that the dimension of the define
array a is two okay how about total
number of elements in an array yes for a
2d array it will be the product of
number of rows and columns but if you
had more dimension this calculation
could be a little complicated
fortunately we can retrieve the number
of elements directly using size
attributes a dot size will give us the
number of elements present in the array
a we can expect the output to be the
product of the rows and the columns
which is 5 into 4 which is 20 let's
check it as we expected the output is 20
which means there are 20 values in the
array attributes like size and shape are
very useful when you have to iterate
over array elements to perform some
computing
you can also access the data type of
each element using the D type attribute
of the array
let's check the data type of the values
present in array a in this case our
array elements are of the type float 64
that is 64 bit floating point numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
