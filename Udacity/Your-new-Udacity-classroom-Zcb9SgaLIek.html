version of the classroom that were
really excited about with some new
features and a brand new design let's go
take a look we've upgraded the classroom
experience to make learning at Udacity
even better and we want to walk you
through some of the features to get
started let's go to the classroom with
the syllabus view we've now made it
easier to see your entire program at a
glance you'll see here an overview of
your core curriculum plus any extra
curricular courses and career content
offered in the program you'll have a
clearer look at the parts that make up
the core curriculum click into any of
those parts and you'll instantly see an
overview of the lessons in that section
the left-hand navigation bar acts as
your home base allowing you to return to
the syllabus and see the progress you've
made in other parts here you'll see the
core curriculum menu on this left
navigation bar and if you've started a
part you'll see the percentage of
completed curriculum there you can also
collapse the core curriculum view to get
a better look at the extra curricular
content let's take a closer look at the
overview for a part will automatically
bring you to the lesson where you left
off the lessons are outlined in a
numerical timeline where you can track
each lessons progress when lessons are
complete they'll collapse so you know
you finished it when you want to revisit
a lesson and view that content just
click on to the lesson card and it'll
expand so you can get back to that
lesson if you're ready to start learning
and to see the content just click on a
lesson or click resume learning here
you'll see the left nav bar will now
list the contents of a lesson you can
also access additional materials and
search your curriculum from here from
the nav bar you can also go back to the
part overview if you need to focus on
the video and want to collapse this nav
bar click the hamburger button
back in the parte overview you can find
the projects you'll need to complete to
graduate which are indicated by a
capital P if applicable we've listed
project due dates and your project
progress while in a desktop view when
you scroll back to the top you'll see
that the top nav bar also showcases due
dates for projects the person
interviewed of the part and your project
status if there are any projects the
circles here on the right side of the
top nav bar will change colors as the
project moves through in progress - in
review
- successfully completed since we know
so many students are studying from their
phones we've made the mobile classroom
experience just as great as what we
showed you on desktop so that you can
keep learning wherever you go once you
have completed all projects in the core
curriculum or the nanodegree the header
at the top of each part will reflect
that you are eligible for graduation
click the finish and graduate button to
be sent an email to complete graduation
so this is your new classroom we hope
that it makes for an ever better
learning experience for you but we'd
love to hear your feedback</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
