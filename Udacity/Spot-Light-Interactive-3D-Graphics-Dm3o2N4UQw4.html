spotlight in the real world you shine
this sort of light on something to make
it the focus of attention this emitter
is like a point light in that it has a
position it's also like a directional
light and that you have to point it
somewhere however there's one important
addition control of the cone of light it
forms the main control in three J s is
the angle where the spotlight ends
there's also a fall-off exponent that's
similar to how specular highlighting
works as you increase this number the
spotlight becomes tighter more elaborate
spotlights are possible for example this
is 3d studio max of spotlight it uses
two angles to control the outer cone and
a separate inner cone it calls a hotspot
the spotlight can also be circular or
rectangular there are no rules about
what constitutes a spotlight and with
shader programming you can create any
sort of spotlight you can imagine I
should also mention at this point that
you can put any number of lights in a
scene there's only one ambient light
setting but you can have as many spot
point and directional lights as you want
each lights contribution is added to the
fragments final color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
