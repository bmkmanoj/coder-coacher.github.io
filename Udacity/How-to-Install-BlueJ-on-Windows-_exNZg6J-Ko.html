Java bluej and the lesson files on your
Windows computer here I'm using Windows
7 but but if you use another version of
Windows the process will be the same
your screen might just look a little
different
first we will uninstall any old versions
of Java that you may have open the
control panel look for where it says
uninstall a program and look at the
names of the programs they're
alphabetically sorted if you don't see
anything with Java then that's great
just move on to the next step but if you
do see something that says Java whatever
the version may be selected right-click
and select uninstall confirm everything
allow the uninstaller to proceed when
the uninstaller is finished see whether
than any other Java items here I have
another one and uninstall that too once
all versions of Java are removed close
the control panel and open the browser
use the web address for downloading the
Java development kit that we give you in
the written instructions once you get to
the download page scroll down accept the
license agreement and pick the option
that's called windows x86 select the
file say that you want to run the
Installer confirm the install and once
the Installer pops up keep clicking next
and next until you get to the success
message and then click close now go to
the bluej download site again we've
given you the web address in the written
instructions click on the windows
installer yes you want to run it and run
this installer in the same way keep
clicking next and install and yes and
finish to check your installation look
on the desktop you should find a bluejay
icon right click on it select open and
when bluej comes up like this then you
did great leave bluej open for a minute
and go on and install the files for
lesson 1 go back to your browser use the
web address for the lesson 1 zip file
that you find in the written
instructions when asked what to do with
lesson wondered zip don't open it
but select/save when the download has
been completed look into the download
folder find the lesson1 zip file it
won't say dot zip right-click on it
select extract all click on browse over
here find your name and locate my
documents select ok and extract now go
back to bluejay select project open
project make sure that over here my
documents is highlighted then you should
find the lesson1 folder here double
click on it now you should see a number
of folders that all have a bluejay icon
next to it pick the one that says hello
select open and you should get a display
that looks somewhat like this
congratulations you've now successfully
installed java bluej and the lesson1
files if you got stuck somewhere just
send us a message on the discussion
