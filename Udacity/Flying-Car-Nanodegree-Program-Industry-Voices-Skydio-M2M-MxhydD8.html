drones is they present this kind of
creative canvas there's this inherent
freedom in flight you can move in three
dimensions you can go anywhere you want
at any time you want and when you pair
that with autonomy and AI I think
there's just a bunch of really exciting
possibilities and we've gotten to see
that come to life as we've we've built
this system our mission is to open up
the power of what drones can do by
making them trustworthy and autonomous
we've come up with a pretty different
user experience of what you get with a
normal drone so all the complexity that
would normally be in flying the thing is
just in a really simple mobile app so
you control it from your phone the app
is built essentially like the camera app
on your phone our product will just fly
itself and capture amazing video without
you having to do anything Scotty is a
start-up that's building fully
autonomous drones based around computer
vision our focus in our first product is
based around video and a consumer use
case and at the same time we're building
and pushing forward the core technology
of autonomous navigation so what can we
understand from these images like how
does the drone move how do we avoid
obstacles how do we get good shots and
track people and aggressive scenarios
all the same types of things that go
into self-driving cars you know the core
in a blur for for autonomous navigation
we're playing in a space where autonomy
really matters it opens up a lot of
interesting applications and
capabilities the trajectories of
autonomous systems and electric power
computers are getting small enough and
light enough and cheap enough sensors
are getting good enough the AI and
machine learning is getting mature
enough like those algorithms are
actually getting robust enough where you
can build a product and a product
experience around them I think the
Udacity flying car nano degree program
is a really great way for people who
have a background in maybe software
engineering or engineering generally and
are interested in autonomous systems to
get exposure to a bunch of different
super relevant topics for what it takes
to build a autonomous flying system
so I think we're at a point where we're
gonna see rapid progress and it's a
super exciting time to be getting into
this industry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
