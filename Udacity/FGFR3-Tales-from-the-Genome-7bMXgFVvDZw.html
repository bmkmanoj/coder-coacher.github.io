copies of every gene does not protect
you from a dominant allele as we learned
in Lesson five having one copy of a
dominant allele is enough to cause
phenotype now in the case of dwarfism
the most common cause is a dominant
allele that causes achondroplasia which
is inhibition and bone growth a corner
play gia is one of the most common
causes of dwarfism so this is what a
normal bone growth looks like if we take
a long bone from your body the end of it
has a particular kind of cell here I'm
outlining it in red that actually grows
and divides and then it comes into the
long bone part of the bone and provides
the material that grows the bone longer
over time now those red cells are red
indicating that they have a particular
important protein called fgfr3 it stands
for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
and we'll learn a bit more about it in a
moment but we'll just call it fgfr3 for
now and as these fgfr3 positive cells
grow and divide then they become the
cells that are part of the the physical
substance of the long bone itself so the
way the bone grows itself essentially is
these fgfr3 positive cells grow and
divide into more cells and that's how
the bone gets longer now how do bones
end up a certain length and they're not
shorter or longer well it turns out that
this protein fgfr3 is really important
in regulating this process in fact
signaling through fgfr3 in a cell keeps
the bone from growing too long an active
fgfr3 protein prevents bones from
growing even longer but some mutations
in the fgfr3 gene results in a protein
that's overactive and it actually stunts
the growth of Bones even more so that
they can't grow as long even as they
normally would so let's learn a bit more
about this fgfr3 protein the fgfr3 gene
can be found on chromosome 4 in the
human genome chromosome 4 has 186
million base pairs in it and the fgfr3
protein can be found near the end via
if our three gene itself consists of 17
exons spanning over 15,000 base pairs
after transcription and splicing the
resulting mRNA has 2421 nucleotides of
coding region and after translation
we'll have a protein with 806 amino
acids remember we just divided 2421 by 3
and then subtracted 1 from the overall
answer because the last codon is a stop
codon which doesn't code for an amino
acid it's just empty now let's actually
look at one allele of this gene that's
associated with the contemplation one
allele of the fgfr3 gene contains AG 2 a
a guanine to add name mutation at
position 1138 of the coding region now
using the genetic code which we learned
about in lesson 3 and you can find
posted in the instructors notes on this
page I want you to determine the change
expected in the amino acid sequence here
and then select the type of mutation
best used to describe this a allele from
the list below now if you have trouble
answering this you want to go back and
review mutations from lesson 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
