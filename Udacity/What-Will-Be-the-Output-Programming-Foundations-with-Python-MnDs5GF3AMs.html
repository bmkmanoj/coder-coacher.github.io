design and you'll notice that thus far
we've created just the one instance of
our class movie and that instance is Toy
Story the next thing for us to do is
create another instance of class movie
and this time we are going to create
avatar so to do that I am back here at
my code here's the code for the class
movie and here is my entertainment
center dot Pi file which is where I'm
creating my first instance Toy Story now
you may have noticed that I've reduced
the font size of my code this is so I
can squeeze all of the code in one video
frame so you can see it properly next I
will create the instance called avatar
by calling media dot movie the first
piece of information I have to supply is
the name of the movie which is avatar
next is its storyline which is a marine
on an alien planet that is followed by
avatars movie poster which I will paste
here and the final piece of information
is avatars YouTube trailer which I will
also copy in alright so here is our new
instance avatar let's print out its
storyline next so I will say print
avatar dot storyline there it is I'm
also going to comment out my previous
print statement which was printing out
Toy Story storyline so there it is let
me go ahead and save this file now
before I go ahead and run this program
let me ask you a question what do you
think will be the output of this line of
code right here now I know that the font
of the score is really difficult to read
so what I'm going to do is make it a
little bit bigger so here it is the code
in a bigger font size here is where we
are creating the instance avatar and
here we are trying to print its
storyline so what do you think will be
the output of the following code here
are some answer choices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
