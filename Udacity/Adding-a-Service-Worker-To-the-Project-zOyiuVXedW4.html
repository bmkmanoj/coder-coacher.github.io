project and start messing around if
these requests to make things easy the
project already contains a script file
at public J s SW index J s and it's
currently empty
so let's add a quick console.log the
build system picks this up and the final
result is served at s W J s at the root
of the server the extra code here is the
output of Babel which the script runs
through Babel lets you use some of the
newer JavaScript features but I'm gonna
stick with es5 but if you feel like
writing newer JavaScript go ahead as we
talked about before the service worker
receives events let's add a listener for
one of these fetch when the user
navigates to a page within your
serviceworker scope it controls it the
network request for its HTML goes to the
service worker and triggers a fetch
event but not only that you also get a
fetch event for every request triggered
by that page CSS javascript images you
get a fetch event for each even if
they're a request to another origin and
we can inspect them with JavaScript so
in my fetch event I'm going to log event
dot request to find out what kind of
information is in that object click
through to the next lesson that was me
trying to build up some dramatic tension
I mean event dot request it's it's
clearly going to be information about
the request or is it yes
yes it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
