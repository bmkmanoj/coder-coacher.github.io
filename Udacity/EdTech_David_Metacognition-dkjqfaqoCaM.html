interviews that I've done here at
Udacity you'll notice that I'm in the
other chair today and that's because
we're talking about a topic that is very
important to me my dissertation research
was on using an intelligent tutoring
system in exploratory learning
environment to teach students
metacognition and metacognition is
really the thing I'm ultimately most
interested in so i'll be talking about
that today ah so jason has again agreed
to give me my questions for this little
interview all right David let's get
started why do you have so much interest
in metacognition so the main reason I
have a lot of interest in metacognition
is there's actually research that you've
probably covered so far on this lesson
it shows that metacognition is the chief
determinant in students success going
forward that if there's one thing we can
teach them that will really ensure that
they're successful in their later
academic career it's metacognition it's
thinking about how do I learn what are
the best processes for me how do I
monitor that when I'm trying to learn
something if I'm struggling instead of
just continuing to struggle and assuming
there's something wrong with me if I
can't learn this material how can I
actually reflect on this and say what is
it about this and I'm struggling with
and how can i adjust for that so to
really treat the learning process as a
first class object really think about
that as a part of the learning that the
process is something that I can control
that I get to drive my own learning and
it's really important because it's kind
of that old principle if you teach a man
to fish he'll eat for a lifetime if you
teach a person to learn they'll learn
for a lifetime many times an education
we're focused on teaching students some
material and the material is very
important and I would never insult that
but if you teach a student to learn in
general and that's really going to help
them later in their life that's the main
reason why I'm most interested
metacognition I think that
philosophically it's what really
determines soon success and there's also
empirical evidence that says that a
student's mindset towards learning is
what will determine whether or not
they're successful at new things that
they come across oh wow it's pretty
power yeah what are some of the main
challenges in teaching students about
metacognition so the main challenge is
that metacognition by its very
definition is inside the head it's I'm
thinking about my own thinking and so
the thinking is inside the head but at
least when I'm thinking about like the
cameras that are in front of me I can
think about how they work I can reason
about them physically I can reach out I
can adjust them I can manipulate them
when I'm thinking about thinking I'm
thinking about something that's inside
my head as well and
so if I'm teaching somebody I'm teaching
somebody Algebra I can look at the
output of what they're doing but with
metacognition I'm not looking explicitly
on the output of their metacognition I'm
looking at the output of the thought
that was reasoned over so there's a
couple layers of separation away we're
talking so much about thinking about
thinking it's a little bit hard to even
that have the conversation it's part of
the reason why it's so difficult isn't
it what are we thinking about in wins
that's part of the difficulty but
because we're not operating on something
that we can see what kind of feeling
around in the dark and we're trying to
figure out what a person is you know
really thinking underneath the hood so
to speak can I look at the things that
you're actually outputting or saying or
writing and use that to infer something
about the meta cognition that went into
it it's very difficult it's difficult
for human tutors for AI tutors it's even
more difficult because they don't have
the benefit of all the information that
we have they don't have the nach of the
human empathy that I think a lot of
teaching metacognition to another person
is that you're a person I'm a person to
a certain extent i can put myself inside
your mind and i can kind of reese
emulator computers have no natural
ability to do that so even just building
in human empathy or human thought or
human approaches to problems it's part
of being able to teach them to do you
know to teach metacognition so yeah
that's the main reason is difficult is
because what we're operating on is
invisible and it's not easy to
manipulate something you can't see for
sure how can technology posture meta
cognitive development so I think the
main thing that we first have to wrestle
with is exactly the same issue that i
mentioned before the main challenge to
facilitating meta cognitive development
is making the invisible visible right
i'm taking what's it invisible inside
the brain and putting it out on the page
putting it in software somewhere like
that and so the way we can do that is by
structuring the environment in which
this development takes place such that
students have to make that explicit also
one way we can do it is by asking them
to do we call think a lot of protocol
which is where they go through an
activity and just think a lot about it
it's not the best approach because our
research has shown that when I ask you
while you're doing whatever you're about
to do tell me what you're thinking it
actually changes the way you think and
so I don't get at the root of what you
would really think if you work actively
reflecting on it but at the same time it
gives you
learning experience of you know making
your own thought process explicit which
is very valuable that even sometimes
just making students aware of what
they're thinking even if we're entirely
sure what they're actually thinking just
for something to reflect on it can be
the most valuable learning experience of
all but in my own dissertation research
what I ended up doing was taking a
certain part of the activity that
students were completing and asking them
to output that to the page so it was
constructing theories to explain a
natural phenomenon and part of that is
why do I believe what I believe that's
part of metacognition is reflecting on
the internal reasons that underlie on my
beliefs and so we took that and
basically said take whatever it is that
makes you believe what you're currently
believing and put it on the page code it
in a certain way as a kind of
classification system saying this is an
example of this kind of believe this is
an example this kind of belief and put
it out there so we're making explicit
something about the metacognitive
process it's not always easy it's
actually it's never easy but it's not
always even possible but for certain
domains we can do some things where
students are asked to make their
metacognitive process explicit and in
fact that's something that we do I think
really strongly in this class or at
least we try to which is take the way
you think about the course material and
externalize it externalizing the context
of your own problems externalized in the
context of the solutions that you'd like
to develop and share that with your
classmates and that way you're sharing a
little bit about how you approach the
problem how you're thinking about the
problem with others to get feedback on
your metacognition a little bit more
explicitly again not easy and I don't
think I can even begin to imagine right
now I might design an AI agent to be a
TA or an instructor for this class but
maybe several years from now based on a
project at someone in this class starts
to develop we might start to see a
metacognitive agent that's more than
just a you know a tutor or a guide it's
actually kind of a partner or a mentor
in an environment like this they can
mimic some of the things that it wants
you to learn to do which i think is
really the best approach for teaching
metacognition is to demonstrate it to
show this is how I would thinking about
this problem that you might want to
think about this way so that's
fascinating thank you again Jason for
interviewing me on another topic of
course David and thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
