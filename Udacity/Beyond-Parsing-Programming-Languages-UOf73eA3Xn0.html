learning about context-free grammars and
languages can context-free grammars be
used to do anything other than parsing a
programming language that's a good point
Peter and the answer is yes in fact
there are a large number of applications
for language formalisms or context-free
grammars I'll just list four or five of
them one of the first is security we saw
last time that regular expressions can
be used in virus checkers in fact that's
how the vast majority of virus checkers
work they're like a big lexer it turns
out that these days the most common
attacks or exploits or vulnerabilities
reported involve cross-site scripting or
sequel database code injection
vulnerabilities both of these involve an
application a web application like you'd
ask these servers reading in a string
from the user and treating it as if it
were part of another important language
like HTML or sequel the language of
database queries turns out that there
are a number of techniques available for
using context-free grammars to detect if
a string from a user is normal or if
it's trying to take advantage of some
special system structure if it's one of
these attacks and essentially the way to
do that is we pretend to parse the final
string given the context that the user
has provided and if the users changes
the string provided by the user ends up
influencing a large part of the parse
tree of the abstract syntax tree in
essence if the high-water mark of the
changes or the tainted information from
the user reaches very very high then we
know it's a sequel code injection or
cross-site scripting attack because
those are attacks are based on
destroying or conflating or deforming
the essential structure of the output
language so one possible use for them is
in security some of the best ways to
figure out if something is sequel code
injection or cross-site scripting let's
say before you actually run it and find
out involve the use of grammars another
is in the world of optimization a
production compiler or interpreter is
often very interested in getting the
same results but faster or using less
memory or and this is a big one these
days using less power if you're running
a program on your smartphone or some
other mobile device you really want it
to last as long as possible later on in
the class around unit six will actually
cover some basic optimizations I'll
teach some of them to you and you'll get
a chance to use them in your JavaScript
interpreter for the web browser but for
now just take my word for it in order to
do optimizations we have to figure out
what the values of variables are for
example if I can figure out that X is
always 0 and you have a line in your
program that says why gets y plus X I
don't have to bother interpreting that
line because I know that adding 0 to
something doesn't change its value that
sort of thing is called a dataflow
analysis or an optimization because if I
can reason about how numbers flow
through your program then I can make
them faster higher stronger use less
power it's a really nice idea it's going
to turn out that the best known research
idea for figuring out values as they
flow through various functions in your
program is related to context-free
grammars or more formally context-free
language reach ability it turns out that
interprocedural dataflow analysis is the
same problem as in a theoretical sense
context-free language reach ability
which is the same problem as could i
generate a string in a context free
grammar turns out all of you are experts
at figuring out if we could generate a
string in the language of a context-free
grammar and exactly that sort of
knowledge is one of the things program
optimizers use to squeeze every last
drop of goodness out of a program third
possibility is in linguistics or
computational linguistics there are a
number of references to these underneath
the lecture videos but it turns out that
a lot of these notions of context-free
grammars or generative grammars or
universal grammars actually came out of
psychology or linguistics or
computational linguistics to help us
understand human and natural language
it's a really important use but let me
skip past that one since it's too easy
in some sense I'll give you two more one
more near and dear to my heart is
specification mining it turns out that
often we want to figure out what a
program should be doing just by looking
at its source code and this is super
tricky it's like trying to learn the
rules of English grammar by reading a
bunch of high-school student essays and
looking what they get right and get
wrong in common as you can imagine it's
very difficult to get this perfectly
because just because a number of
students say something doesn't
necessarily mean that they're following
the rules they might all get it wrong
the same way and if you've seen people
post on forums maybe not everyone has
perfect grammar so just taking samples
might not be the right way to do it
turns out that the output of
specification mining often takes the
form of a formal grammar or some sort of
state machine you should always call
open and then you should call close a
lot of important security or software
engineering policies can be described in
terms of some sort of grammar now it
turns out that learning grammars from
examples is really really difficult both
that and this notion I mentioned earlier
interprocedural data flow analysis are
the sorts of things that one might get
into in a subsequent course after this
one but where you'd build on the
knowledge you learned here here's my
last example writing this one's perhaps
the the farthest from the norm but I
think students may appreciate it it
turns out that if you're using a
cellular phone people might be able to
intercept what you're saying if they
just listen very hard so these days
modern cell phones or mobile phones
might try to encrypt the data packets
that they send containing your vocal
information so that in theory
eavesdroppers can't figure out what's
going on however if I've used a lot of
that computational linguistics
information if I've studied the world it
turns out that in different spoken
languages or with different accents we
have different patterns of speech and
then pauses and some of the initial
implementations of phone encryption
tried to be smart and save power they
would only send information when you
actually said something so this meant
that attackers could listen in and using
linguistic analysis information even if
they couldn't tell what you were saying
even if it was all scrambled just by
doing a statistical analysis of how long
you said and then how long you paused
and then how long you said again we can
reliably identify what language you're
speaking and worse than that regional
accents whether you say you're speaking
English whether you're speaking with
some sort of New York Brooklyn accent or
from the south or from California we can
tell based just on the
patterns of how long you speak and how
long the pauses are that has very
unfortunate Orwellian implications for
some sort of surveillance state
conveniently it is more or less totally
defeated by encrypting the silence as
well using more power to just get rid of
that side channel prevent people from
figuring out when you're speaking and
when you're not that's an example of an
application that also uses this sort of
linguistic analysis perhaps a little
less related to context-free grammars
but still in the same vein all in all
context-free grammars context-free
languages come up in significantly more
of computer science than just parsing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
