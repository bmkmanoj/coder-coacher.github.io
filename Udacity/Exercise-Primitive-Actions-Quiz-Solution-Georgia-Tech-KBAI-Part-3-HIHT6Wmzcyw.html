sentence I debated for a minute between
propelled and move object if John's
pushing the card it seems fair to say
he's moving the object but the
connotation of pushing the cart is that
he's just launching the cart into motion
we don't really know where he's moving
it so I decided that propelled is the
better answer there for John took the
book from Mary it suggested the book
used to be in Mary's possession and now
it's in John's possession so it we've
moved possession of the book for John
ate ice cream with a spoon it's very
straightforward from our earlier example
to John ingested ice cream with a spoon
the fourth example is a little bit more
complicated as well because it's an
action going on inside John's own mind
but if John decided to go to the store
it suggests a final step of a thought
process rather than an ongoing process
so I said John concluded to go to the
store instead of thought about that
sounds right to do it there's sort of
several other things to note here
one is that last sentence here as to who
burbs in it decided and go if you'll see
in a minute how we can deal with
sentences or stories that have multiple
verbs in them second you're right in
that sometimes it's not very easy to
decide which is the best primitive
action for capturing the meaning of a
particular burb here so the verb here
was pushed and the reason David put
propelled or move objectors because in
propulsion the body is in some sense
can't contact with the particular object
that is getting moved now we have not
shown here the detailed specification
each of one of these primitive actions
but I can tell you that the readings at
the end dude give them in detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
