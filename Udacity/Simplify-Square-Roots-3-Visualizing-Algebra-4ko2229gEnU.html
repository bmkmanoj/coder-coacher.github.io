you got at least two of these correct
let's see how we can simplify each one
the quickest way to simplify the square
root of 80 is to rewrite 80s 16 times 5
we take the square root of 16 which is
four and then we leave the five inside
of the radical since we can't simplify
it it's not a perfect square you might
have thought to do this as well you
might have said 80 equals 8 x 10 and
then you might have split 8 into 4 times
2 and 10 is 2 2 times 5 we know two
times two equals four so we really have
a group of two fours because we have two
fours and our indexes of two since we're
taking a square root we can pull 14 out
in front of the radical so we have four
times the square root of 5 4 120 we
split this number up into 12 x 10 and
then 3 times 4 times 2 times 5 the only
perfect square factor in this radical is
the four so we take the square root of 4
which gives us to the other factors are
not perfect squares so they need to stay
within the radical so we have 3 times 2
which is 6 times 5 which equals 30 for
this last one we can split up 180 into
10 times 18 we split up the 10 and 25
times 2 and 18 and 22 x 9 notice that we
have a perfect score of 9 here also we
have a perfect square of 4 we use our
product rule to split up this one
radical into the multiplication of three
radicals we know the square root of 4 is
2 and the square root of nine equals 3
and finally we multiply 3 times 2 which
equals 6 which is multiplied by the
square root of 5 since we can't simplify
it this was perhaps the longer way to do
the problem notice that we have two
smaller perfect squares here well if we
multiply these together we would get 36
so we really know that 180 is the same
thing as 5 x 36 so instead if we rewrote
180 as five times 36 we could have six
times the square root of five since the
square root of thirty-six equals six we
can get to this answer more quickly by
splitting up our original ratikan into
the largest product of a perfect square
and another factor by using the largest
perfect square here we
directly to the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
