there are a lot of cases to deal with in
getting this kind of search just right
and we made a couple of mistakes along
the way I sort of duplicated the history
of the field and there's a couple tools
we can get to avoid mistakes and one
tool is to write lots of tests and I
just didn't do enough testing you know I
wanted to go fast I wanted to be able to
show you some of the interesting ideas
and I put it in a few tests but I really
need more to have confidence that it got
this right and the second thing is to
use or better yet reuse existing tools
every time I want to do a search I don't
want to be rewriting this search routine
from scratch because it is tricky and I
will make mistakes so rather i want to
write at once or have somebody else
write at once and then reuse it and in
order to do that we're going to have to
figure out how to generalize so i've
written a function that's good only for
solving the the bridge problem to
research i want to write a search
function that can solve a wide variety
of problems and then i want to reuse
that so that I am NOT repeating mistakes
and I'm not introducing new errors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
