interaction it's not so much just a
robot that has a face that kind of walks
around and talk to people it's much more
than that right I mean we already
talking about taxicabs and drivers those
cars so it's really the idea of any type
of interaction with a robot from a human
perspective absolutely and you Ori you
raised one of those issues robot systems
and I think that a lot of HRI has
focused very much on psychological
studies of what happens between one
robot in one person but if you look at
commercialization and my goal my role
with Silicon Valley robotics has been to
help with the commercialization of a lot
of robotic startups and of course you're
trying to increase the spread of the
technology so you're not ever really in
the situation's talking about one robot
one person interactions you're talking
about multi interactions multiple robots
multiple people and you're talking about
things that need to include duration as
well so I felt that HRI is great as far
as it goes but for people to consider
that that is the only way to look at how
how we're going to interact with robots
is really missing many of the other
dimensions and durations you know
there's very little funding for things
like a long term study so there is one
particular one that studied people's
feelings about rumors in their life over
a period of weeks rather than the
one-off kind of interaction and when you
did that it completely overturned a lot
of the papers that were saying people
responded this way to robots that do
this and people respond that way to
robots that do that and I thought to me
that captured exactly where we're going
wrong is we take these little snapshots
and we think that it's giving us a full
panorama and it's not and that's that's
common in a lot of studies
you see actually right as always you're
digging in to try to find that one area
but you're not really taking the whole
perspective of actually what's going on
so you shoot in on that area and you say
ah this is the exact result that I was
looking for I set up the study in such a
way that I kind of forced my hand to be
able to get something like that but the
reality is like in the grand scheme of
things or a longer-term study you'll
realize that it's actually quite the
opposite well I think robotics is very
flawed in not being a science it's an
engineering discipline and most papers
are not reproduce Irbil and I'm talking
well beyond HRI it's really every area
this was one of these things that
Willard Garrett was very strongly about
changing that paradigm by creating a a
common robotics platform and then a
common robotics operating system so you
had a greater chance of being able to
take somebody else's research and
replicate it and ideally get the same
results and that's been pretty much
lacking in the field of robotics for
those people who don't know Willow
Garage is also the creators of Ross
which is why they use platform pretty
much any robotics company that's
starting within the last 10 years or so
absolutely it's now I think in the last
five years it's gone from being used by
companies that knew Willow Garage to
being used by pretty much every startup
that I'm in contact with and it may not
be being used at their commercial
release level but it's being used in the
development stages at the very least</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
