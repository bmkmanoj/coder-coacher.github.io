dependencies that can cause pipeline
stalls consider these two instructions
we add R 2 and R 3 put the result in R 1
then the subtract instruction here takes
R 1 and uses it to compute our seven we
say that the subtract instruction has a
data dependence on this app in fact we
can have this data dependence and there
could be another instruction that
produces r 8 that the subtract also
depends on when we have a data
dependence that means that we cannot
just do these instructions like they
were loads of laundry that have nothing
to do with each other we have to have
the ad producer 1 before the subtract
can use it this type of data dependence
is called a read after write dependence
we read something after it has been
written and that order needs to be
preserved this type of dependence is
also called flow dependence because the
data flows from one instruction to the
other and it is also called true
dependence because there is really a
dependence as in the subtract needs the
add to finish before it because the
value doesn't exist until the add is
finished so again this type of
dependence is called raw or read after
write or flow or true dependence there
are two other types of data dependencies
let's say that there is later a multiply
instruction that takes r5 and r6 and
produces r1 so that later instructions
will use that r1 as the result of the
multiplication so for this dependence we
say that sort of lower true dependence
there is a dependence between the add
and the multiply the add needs to finish
first and then the multiply needs to
finish because we want the result of the
multiply to end up as the final value of
r1 if we let the add finish later
then r1 produced by the add will be left
in the r1 so subsequent instructions
would see that value which would be
wrong this type of dependence is called
a right after right
or an output dependence basically the
final result or the output for r1 is
what's affected and right off the right
simply because they're both writing and
we need to preserve the order of the
writes this right should happen after
this right the third type of dependence
is here the subtract needs to finish
reading r1 before multiply can be
allowed to overwrite it this type of
dependence is called right after read
because the write needs to happen after
this read and it is also called anti
dependence because it sort of reverses
the order of the flow dependencies for
reasons we will see later these two
types of dependencies are called false
or named dependencies so we have true
dependencies which are these raw
dependencies or flow dependencies and we
have false or named dependencies that
have to do with overwriting a value that
somebody has written or read previously
or at least should read or write
previously now we have a read after
write write after write and write after
read dependence so how about a read of
the reedy pendens that's the only one
that is missing here let's say we have
two adds both of which are reading are
three read of the read is not a
dependence because these two
instructions don't need to be done in
the order of that dependence pretty much
we can reorder these two instructions
they will still read the correct value
of r3 so that is why this is not a
dependence the second instruction
doesn't depend on the first one it can
be done before or after it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
