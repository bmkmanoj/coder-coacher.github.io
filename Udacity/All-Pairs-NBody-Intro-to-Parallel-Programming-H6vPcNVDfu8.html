kernel in scientific computation this is
called an in-body computation in an
in-body computation you have in objects
each of which exerts a force on each
other object you'll use in body
computations to say model the
gravitational interaction between stars
and a galaxy or the electrostatic forces
between a number of charged particles
it's the way we compute molecular
dynamics which in turn can model protein
folding and misfolding it is an
important component of our understanding
of disease and drug discovery and body
techniques are used in folding at home
for instance the specific formulation of
n body computation that we'll discuss
today is called all-pairs n-body and i'm
basing this discussion on an excellent
article by Lars Nylund mark Harrison
Yann Prince in 2007 and GPU gems three
all-pairs n-body is the simplest in body
computation it's known as a brute force
method and it involves separately
calculating the force between each pair
of elements and then adding up the
resulting forces on each element a
simulation using n body we usually have
two steps first compute the forces on
each element then move each element a
little bit based on its force and then
repeat so we first want to understand
the complexity of this approach so we
have n objects each of which computes
the forces on it from each other object
for n objects what is the work
complexity of computing all-pairs n-body
because the amount of work proportional
to n n log n n squared or n cubed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
