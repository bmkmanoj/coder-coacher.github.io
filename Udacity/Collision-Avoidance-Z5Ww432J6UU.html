several machines share the same medium
is that two messages can't be sent at
the same time if they tried the data in
the line would likely be corrupted we
say that there is a collision when this
happens these collisions can have an
important role in the performance of
distributed systems where multiple
machines connected by a local network
are used to solve a problem so
understanding how and why these
collisions occur is important for the
study of operating systems we'll discuss
three solutions to the collision problem
the first is carrier sense multiple
access with collision detection or csma
/ CD which was used with early Ethernet
when a node sends a frame it also
measures the signal on the wire if it
finds what it's sent then great if not
then it assumes another node was trying
to send at the same time causing a
collision therefore it sends a special
jamming signal that helps ensure that
all other nodes detect the collision it
then waits for an amount of time that is
part exponentially based on the number
of recent collisions it has detected but
also random so that the nodes don't all
just mirror each other and keep sending
messages at the same time another
solution to the collision problem is
token ring or token bus here the nodes
in the network are arranged in a ring
add the two physical connections or
logically they then continually pass
around a token that is empty by default
that determines whose turn it is if this
note here wants to send a message he
waits for the token then sends out his
message and once he's received an
acknowledgement he then continues to
pass the token on around the next one
wanting to send a message will grab the
token send out his message wait for an
acknowledgement and then past the token
around some more this system is fair and
it does not fail under heavy loads but
it suffers for more latency than the
more aggressive csma/cd where possible
both traditional Ethernet and token ring
have been largely replaced by switched
Ethernet a switch is physically
connected to the nodes like a hub but
instead of broadcasting every frame that
comes in like a hub it looks at the
destination MAC address and routes the
frames accordingly the advantage is now
that we have fewer collision for
instance two pairs of nodes can
communicate simultaneously whereas this
would have been impossible before
naturally a switch will need a table
mapping MAC addresses to the
report it should send the frame app too
well in convenient way to populate this
table is with learning whenever a switch
sees a frame it examines the max source
and puts that MAC address along with the
port number in the table then to figure
out where to send it it looks in the
table and if it finds the appropriate
port great if not then it just broadcast
the ethernet frame to all the nodes once
we run out of ports we can begin to
arrange switches in a hierarchy like so
in our top level switch MAC addresses
for this subtree would all map to port
one those in this subtree would map to
port 2 and those in this subtree would
map to port three lower down in this
switch the MAC addresses for these
machines would map to their ports and
the mac address for all these other
machines in the network would map to
this switches uplink since that's the
path along which the frame would need to
travel switches dramatically increase
the number of messages that can be sent
over local network in the simplest
apology we're all nodes are connected to
a single switch it's almost as good as
having a dedicated length between each
pair the only way that server one
wouldn't be able to send to server 2 is
because server to itself is busy never
because the link is busy and even when
server 2 is busy the switch can queue up
frames to be delivered later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
