is about here and there are 21 people
age 20 to 39 which is about here and
then five people between 40 and 59 and
five people between sixty and seventy
nine that means our bar graph will look
like this so we have the axes frequency
is always on the y-axis and then the
variable is on the x-axis in this case
it's age if you recall sometimes the
independent variable is also called the
predictor variable and the dependent
variable which is on the y-axis is also
called the outcome but not in this case
this is a special type of graph called a
histogram and the variable on the y-axis
is just the frequency here at the
intersection of the axes is the origin
its Cartesian coordinates are zero zero
because from here we've gone zero to the
right and zero up each axis goes from
low to high so we start at zero and work
our way up to higher values same with
here on the y axis so now we have a
histogram for our sample of 50 Udacity
