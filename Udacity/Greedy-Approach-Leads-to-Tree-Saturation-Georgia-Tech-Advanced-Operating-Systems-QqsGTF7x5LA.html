constructing ADHD leads to tree
saturation and the congestion happens at
the node which happens to map to a lot
of clustered keys the Korell approach is
very simple don't be greedy what does
that mean well what it means is in the
greedy approach when we have a key key
we try to store it in a node n whose
node ID is equal to K in the Kuril
approach use this as a hint not an
absolute but you still have to have a
method to the madness if you're going to
store it in some place different from n
then those who are trying to discover it
have to have a method to the madness of
where you have stored your key we'll see
how that is done so the top-level bit I
want you to take away is that in the
Kuril DHT the get and put operations are
satisfied by nodes that are different
from the key K the node ID n may not be
close to key and that's why the DHT that
chordal implements is called a sloppy
DHT and we'll talk about details of that
in a minute
the rationale of course is you want to
avoid tree saturation that comes about
when lot of keys map to a particular
node ID and also in the process what we
want to do is spread the metadata over
load so that no single node in this
democratic process of helping one
another is saturated or overloaded by
being a good citizen
how does coral do it it has a novel
key-based routing algorithm which will
describe but the basis for that key
based routing algorithm is to compute
the distance between the source of
forget or a put operation and the
destination for that get output
operation the destination by default is
going to be the node whose ID is equal
to the key that you're looking for so
the distance between the source and the
destination is the XOR distance meaning
if you do an exclusive or the
pattern of the node ID for the source
and the bit pattern for the node ID for
the destination that XOR of the two
quantities give you the distance between
the two nodes in the overlay Network
space and the reason why you want to do
an XOR is because an XOR operation as
opposed to say doing a subtraction is
going to be much faster we do an XOR to
find out the distance between the source
and the destination that needs to
communicate so for instance if the
source address is 14 and the destination
address is 4 remember that these are
node IDs in the node ID space which is
at the level of the user and if you do
an XOR of that you get 10 so 10 is the
distance between the source 14 and the
destination for the bigger the XOR value
the larger the distance between the
source and the destination in the
application namespace and since we are
dealing with fairly big numbers here the
node ID could be a hundred and 60 bit
quantity and that is the reason we want
to use some simple operation that will
get us the distance XOR is a very quick
operation to implement to get the
distance between source and destination</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
