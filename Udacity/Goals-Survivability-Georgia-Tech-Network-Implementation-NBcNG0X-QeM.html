satisfies the goals of sharing and
interconnection and now let's talk about
some of the other goals that are
discussed in the DARPA design philosophy
paper as we discuss some of these other
goals it's worth considering and
thinking about how well the current
internet satisfies these other design
goals in the face of evolving
applications threats and other
challenges one of the goals discussed is
survivability which states that the
network should continue to work even if
some devices fail or compromised and so
forth there are two ways to achieve
survivability one is to replicate so one
could keep state at multiple places in
the network such that when any node
crashes there's always a replica or hot
standby waiting to take over for the
failure another way to design the
network for survivability is to
incorporate a concept called fate
sharing fate sharing says that it's
acceptable to lose state information for
some entity if that entity itself is
lost for example if a router crashes all
of the state on the router such as the
routing tables are lost if we can design
the network to sustain these types of
failures where the state of a particular
device shares the fate of the device
itself then we can withstand failures
better so fate sharing makes it easier
to withstand complex failure scenarios
and engineering is also easier now it's
worth asking whether the current
internet still satisfies the principle
of fate sharing in a subsequent lesson
we'll talk about network address
translation and how it violates the
notion of fate sharing there are other
examples where the current Internet's
design violates fate sharing and it's
worth thinking about those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
