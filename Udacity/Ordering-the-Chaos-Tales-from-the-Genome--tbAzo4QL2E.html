are inherited can be really difficult
sometimes we have a trait like one of
our parents or the other and other times
you may have a tray not like our parents
at all take these three examples of
families with different traits for
example look at height in the first
scenario we have two parents who are
relatively short who have a son that's
taller than both of them much taller in
fact we have a family where the parents
have a daughter and a little baby and
they all share the same skin color
roughly speaking and in this third
family we have one parent who has a
disposition of being happy all the time
and the other parent has a disposition
of being sad all the time both the
daughter and the Sun have a disposition
of being happy what I want you to tell
me is does the indicated trait appear
related to one or both of the parents at
all for example in the case of height I
want you to compare the Sun to the
parents and see if it appears that in
some form or fashion whether it's a
combination of the parents or one of the
parents sharing the straight does the
Sun appear related with regards to this
particular trait of height the same
thing in the scenario for skin color and
the same thing in the scenario we set up
for disposition go ahead and tell me
which answer you think is best for each
case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
