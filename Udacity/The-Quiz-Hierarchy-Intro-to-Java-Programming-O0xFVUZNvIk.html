makes it easy to understand the concepts
of super and sub classes but it doesn't
make for a very interesting
implementation instead let's look at
quizzes and the quiz you can have
different kinds of questions so it's
natural to have a superclass question
and then you may have various subclasses
maybe a question where you need to fill
in a missing word or a question where
you're given a bunch of choices or one
where you have to supply a number but it
might be okay if it's not exactly the
right answer a numeric question might
take roundoff into account and so on you
could even think that there is a
subclass of choice question I'll call it
a multi choice question you know one of
those will you need to supply all of the
choices that are correct what do our
questions have in common they all need
to be able to display themselves and the
display may be as simple as showing the
question text or it might have to have a
list of choices or an underscore at the
right place for filling in a word and
also any question needs to be able to
check its answer that might be a string
comparison or a number of comparison
that's or a number of comparison up to
some accuracy so the idea is that the
superclass question will give reasonable
implementations of these methods and the
subclasses can modify them if they don't
work for the context of the subclass
I've implemented the question class for
you and here is a programming problem
that's designed to make you familiar
with that class so that you can form
subclasses as we go along here is the
question class have a look at its
methods as you answer the next
programming question and here is a demo
program in which I want you to fill in
some details make a question object and
then there is a method present question
that displays a question gets the user
response checks whether was correct
their methods for displaying and for
checking a response and I want you to
look them up
and call them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
