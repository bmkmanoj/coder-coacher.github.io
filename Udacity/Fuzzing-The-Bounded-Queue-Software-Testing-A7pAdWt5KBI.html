time this time will be quite a bit more
specific so we already wrote a random
tester or the little bounded length
queue data structure and one thing we
might want to ask ourselves is did that
supposed to do a good job at all well if
you wrote a queue that found all five of
the bugs that I seated in the queue data
structure then you probably did a pretty
good job but let's take a look again so
we're going to do is we're going to look
at the queue as a finite state machine
we're going to see what kind of states
we can drive that machine into using
bullet using the random tester so we're
going start off with an empty queue and
fifty percent of the time at this point
we're going to make a DQ call which is
going to fail fifty percent of the time
we're going to end q something resulting
in a queue containing one element okay
from here it should be pretty obvious
what's what could happen we can DQ
something going back to the empty state
or in queue sign it something going to
the two element state and let's just
assume that that's full and so the
dynamic process that we're going to get
when we run our random tester is some
sort of a random walk through this
finite state machine and so what we want
to ask ourselves is does this random
walk have a reasonable probability of
executing all the cases and so here
probably the most interesting cases are
dq'ing from an empty queue and queuing
to a full q + n bait and then walking
around the rest of the state space and
so what I've done is I've wrigley random
tester with some extra statistics
keeping so we can tell us about this a
little bit so let's go take a look at
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
