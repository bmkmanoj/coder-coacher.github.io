today today we'll be focusing on
object-oriented programming a lot some
people may be at stage three already who
will be or taken Cano scores and we're
looking at how you would do
object-oriented design and some people
may be may have not gotten there so if
you feel like the concepts that we're
talking and code that we're sharing with
you it if it doesn't make sense feel
free to pause the video make sure you
work through stage three first before
you come on and look at this web cast
session go back through it'll always be
here recorded on the forums and on them
google+ page so you guys come back you
much yeah so highly recommend it because
we will not go over the basics of
object-oriented programming we assume
that you know the basics already through
stage three because the stage the stage
three videos will actually tell you how
you do basic object one chip program so
this is for people who want to learn how
to apply this sort of stuff like if you
need more practice if you want to see
another application something a little
more real world but they would be good
so that this perfect webcast for the
students who are at that stage and ready
yeah actually have a question right
before we start yeah that's good thing
to start off with what is the main
difference between what we've been
learning like procedural programming and
then what we're learning now which is
object right yeah so procedural
programming is step by step instruction
so basically you start from top to
bottom and that's that's that's in a
nutshell start everything from top to
bottom and you well and you never go
back to the code object or to
programming you start from top to bottom
but you also go back that's the in a
nutshell you you go back you like you
actually to the program okay this is
what I program before I wanted to keep
going back and keep executing this code
that I I want you to do as an object and
furthermore the main difference between
procedural an object is that
procedures there's no such thing as
objects and basically an object is
defined as um it's a state is it's an
entity that contains a state and it
takes actions to interact with the world
like an outside world or an internal
world at the programming system because
basically if I can give you an example
this this is an object this is a dry
erase marker so the state and the
attributes is black cylindrical so
reasonable it's erasable and an action
is that I can actually use this to write
so I can actually think about
programming if i were to simulate this
in my programming in the programming
world like in the computer i will tell
the computer this is an object and I'm
gonna tell it ok and every object has
the ability to the holder shape call a
cylindrical shape yeah as an attribute
to be black and it has the ability I'm
gonna write a function called right so
then each object has the ability to
write by itself and on its own so it's
out we'll show you right now how if up
the application that will be building
today and Holly be very very hard and
very error-prone if you were to use
procedural program versus object when
Coverly oh good damping Oh Steph come um
right now later okay right so let's
click done here all right let's dive in
let's dive in so I'm just gonna show you
in the next 30 30 minutes or so 40
minutes of what will be building so i'll
just show you rolling right now so
basically you see me screaming yeah okay
so basically oh here here we go very
cool so this is actually an application
that you can build in python we're going
to give you all the starter code and
also this final code as well so you can
all go back
and code along and try to understand the
parts of the processes that's involved
in object-oriented programming and this
case you can see it's a simple program
too it's a graphical program so this is
actually for a lot of people you just
probably your first time seeing colors
colors and not just not the terminal
then not just a tech space interface but
now we're diving a little bit to the
world of graphical user interface or GUI
programming and yeah there are ton of
madres python has so you just have the
ability to UC libraries to build to be
able to build these sort of graphical
interfaces great so that is what you
know we you want to build and our
starter code this is our starter code
I'm going to just run our starter code
right now it's just this and that's it
so and yeah there's no itch collision we
need to program that in but you can see
that it's a very basic program that
actually goes in and animates us for
both I'll just tell them I'll just say
these are falls just to be just to make
make it will understand that we're
trying to add mix and balls on from the
swing so here's this time we're gonna
show want to talk about and learn
throughout this webcast number want to
work I'm going to dive in and talk about
the theory of animation and how to
implement animation in a program so it's
pretty simple once we decompose
animation what animation really is so
hopefully after this webcast you'll be
under to be able to understand you know
basically to magically high animation in
computer graphics and computer program
so any animation that you see this is
actually the building blocks Oh ending
deals that you'll see in computer
graphics computer program there's Jonah
yeah yeah we're gonna dive in a little
bit deeper into the code and see
actually how these sir context are
created in Python and then how it sort
of derives from other classes that we've
created like a shape and sort of see the
nitty-gritty about how
methods work how instances work and how
method overriding works i know that
you've heard these terms before but we
can see it happen live right in front of
us will be fooled and then later on
we'll see how we can make this a
full-featured program by making the
circles hit the edge and then bounce
back anyway that's believable and then
the way that looks kind of cool in the
end and yeah that's all doable and a few
lines of Python code so I'll be fun to
see how it comes together awesome wait
so okay we switch back to just our
camera yeah awesome right so let's talk
about animation they're gonna make it
right so this it's like don't have you
uh when you grow up have you ever used a
flipbook yeah those are fun those are
fun right basically yeah football stacks
of paper here you draw something avenge
the next page you draw the same object
Rex a character like say Mickey Mouse
cure something like that then but make
me Mickey Mouse slightly chance yeah he
danced this aviso and on every paper
every frame the image slightly changes
not too much but just enough to be able
to say hey Jen its make you believe
dad's moving so basically animation he
took computer graphics in movies the
film it's just a series of still
pictures and this I so allied really
basically it's an illusion there are our
eyes um eNOS our eyes cannot above a
certain point like I'll think 60 frames
per second like if you like if you're
our eyes will not be able to see like if
you wanna see you know the stop motion
like analyst nip or those high FPS
gaming right because if it's a high FPS
camera looks at 2005 per second ago will
record you'll be able to see things like
doing this if it's if I drop this you'll
be able to at a high FPS camera you'll
be able to see this because if it's
faster to see these frame so it looks
like this so if our eyes our eyes cannot
process that family mean it's like a
high human like a high FPS camera or
filming film yeah affiliate or filming
this pet it drop
like it will look like this but our eyes
it'll just look like this same things
like we're just basically pulling our
eyes because we can only display
disciplining at 15 frames per second
this has 50 frames per second this is a
image this is an image this is an
immature it means that it gives us the
illusion that the picture that we sing
on in the frame in the picture is
actually moving movement and that that
is the whole big theory of animation
right now so you know let's stick step
back a little flat don't know my means
this animation is just really series
pictures ok we have this basic theory
how do we actually apply it in
programming we basically tell the
program okay I want you just to display
this picture many times in rapid
succession so basically what does that
mean in computer programming in rapid
succession I would i want to draw a
picture you know about the same time but
then i just changed the picture a little
bit that's maybe a camera just call that
function over and over again let's say i
have a function that draw something
can't I just draw draw yeah then wait a
certain amount of time very little time
and then draw it again create a function
wait execute it then wait to then call
this function again draw draw draw draw
so that's basically how are actually
going to implement animation so let's go
back to the code will show you how
actual the animation will work out and
don't worry we will give you all this
starter code in when we post these are
notes in the discussion forums so
basically our animation is basically
made up of all the hosts this whole
application is made up of these things
right here this is the constructor so
again if you should have been able to if
you're going through stage 3 or you
finish stage 3 you've you're familiar
with constructor function so whenever we
create an application like this an
application frame
I have a construction function so it
will actually upon object creation of
this application it's going to actually
execute these steps so I'm going to use
so this is a oh by the way the lower
that we're using is called tkinter hey
IM ter so basically what this is like i
wanna call i want to inherit a frame
object and then basically call the
constructor for the frame object I'll
then put on line 18 self grid I will
then put this whole application and make
a show because it's not enough that if I
create the object I need to make shift
on on the screen then after that great
i'm going to create all my widgets and I
wish my widgets is just things that I
want to put on to my application screen
and in this function of this crate which
it will actually create my canvas object
and we're going to be using an object
called the canvas object and the canvas
will the canvas actually has functions
that help us um help us creep draw
things so without the canvas object
object you'll be harder for us to
actually basically physically access the
screen and then paint the pixels on the
screen because we would have to figure
out how to do it ourselves but this
library has gives us the ability to draw
change prepackaged draw shapes put
pictures up on it pixels on it pretty
easily and then i'm going to create my
canvas objects and in there my chemist
objects was actually my my circles my
balls and then i'm gonna call this
function called Andy okay I've created
my initial state I have certain circles
and balls and then I'm going to actually
call the animate function to actually
add me start animating things so let's
go down to the anime functions self the
underscore underscore Hannah me and by
the way a caveat underscore underscore
in Python means that is a private
variable so I'm telling I'm creating
these private functions as well to tell
like yeah this is the front of function
you should not
able to you should not access this
method animate outside of the
application object you should never
access them so let's go down to animate
this is a little bit more about a
difference between like private and
public functions sure so probably the
public private functions and variables
are variables that need to find in your
object that that's an internal strife
days worst days you don't want other
people other programmers to access it
because yeah its internal is similar to
up I'll say let's imagine that an object
is a person like I want to be able to
access a breathing rate of a person
right I don't want to actually literally
go in and take your lung
and this is crude but it's kinda like I
should ask them like yeah can you
measure it you measure it so basically
there's probably a function call asked
to like ask a breath rave and then the
person will know okay oh I'll put my
mouth on the breath of my sister and
I'll bring it to this machine versus you
just to literally taking my love down
examining all right because if that
happens there's this whole potential
world problems that you can like I'm
running to yeah if you were to mess with
persons loans directly that's that's bad
yeah even accidentally even if you have
the best intentions these private
variables are proud for real don't be
messing other people's organs yeah
that's thus I'll say that it's a very
crude analogy but I think in elgin well
i understand this so that's that's the
reason why we have this notion of public
variables and these are okay public
facing functions that you could you
should use yeah don't don't mess with
the internal implications that i'm
setting up in my object there they're
just they're meant to be they're there
and they're not meant to be accessed how
do you separate them how do you separate
how you know myungsoo private variable
is supposed to so as i mentioned before
in python there's this underscore on
their splendor right so you'll often see
a lot of if you're dug into function or
an object you'll often see underscore
underscore or in there in the functions
or objects definition yeah that means
that is these are private you should not
be playing around with them we can
always investigate see what they're
there where if you're trying to
understand how they're implemented
implemented NLP but using it I don't
stay away from those huh good question
though yes all right so animate here's
the whole animate function this is
actually the whole secret to animation
this is the magic it's this one less
than 10 months of code actually all
right so here you go here's yeah that's
and you think about like wow this is
this is it well yeah this is it yeah
it's like it's basically here's three
stages of animation one is I update all
my objects positions yeah
in there in this case I object there x
and y coordinates because we're using a
coordinate system this is how we placed
objects on the canvas we use a
coordinate system of x axis y axis if
you're going back to your algebra days
we're trying to graph an option so yeah
there we go so you should have paid more
attention in math class this actually
applies directly if you understand the
Cartesian coordinate system so I i have
a function that says update ever they go
through all my objects and update their
position so basically if i go down here
update all is with my starter code i
have all in one circle my circle left is
my coordinate it's basically my my
x-axis and then I'm adding to 50 / FPS
to the number what number the circle
left is all right so if i get theory if
i have circle left is equal to 0 the
next frame for the next second I move it
250 pixels for every second then the
next second it's going to be a
coordinate 250 so that's how you update
things and let's go back and do a
regional now here's the thing this one
call is a canvas you need to if we're
painting on our regular canvas it means
that if you put paint on your campus
that's pretty much it you can't really
it's hard to erase the pixels and or
erase the paint on the canvas and that's
why we cited tell them we tell people in
efficient programming we use that
analogy we that's why we use the term
cotton canvas if you paint pixels on the
canvas it will not go away and let you
tell it to you physically erase it
because so therefore if you were to
paint and we paint on top of the canvas
it's not going to look like and like the
circles enemy so let's actually count us
out I'm not going to clear everything
else I'm actually going to run this
program
so reach oh oh oh I'm not even be drawn
here you go there you go I'm going to do
this so I'm I'm not deleting all the
stuff on my calves I'm just costly
drawing things over and over again it so
you should make a line it should make a
line see there's various a and that's
that's not what we want sometimes we
want that if you worked into what to
draw draw a series of pixels that we
don't refresh we don't erase what's on
the canvas yeah at every frame so let's
go back here there we go so basically we
draw basically tells the like I'm going
to delete on my existing pixels and then
I'm going to actually call canvas
DeConnick amazon you're here and there's
a function called free old and then you
actually feed it the coordinates here
and the fill color is the circle color
and then the Webster of there like the
borderland so then this will actually
draw the circle all right now let's just
go back this is still you know how I set
it up things like a class application
that's an object but that's like
boilerplate stuff right but if you were
to not use object or to program for our
objects itself Jonah I want to ask you
okay give me 30 objects yeah I'll be
tough like why would it be tough here's
the code to create this one object here
yeah I mean we can do that we can just
copy and paste and I'll do it 30 times
yeah that'll be that'll be fine I can do
that how about if I wanted to say okay I
want some of the circles to be green oh
how many circles do you want to be
greedy when I was 10 10 degree in
circles and I want maybe I want like me
the velocities to be different I wanted
to start at different locations sounds
like too much quick right right like I
sounds like I want to do something that
could automate that work for me right so
so so this is the procedural world we
don't have a set of objects okay like
internal representation of an object
right yeah so
here's where the rubber meets the road I
know there was a question asked like
what's the whole point of what's the
advantages of logic you were different
right this is write it right here if I
tell you I want you to create a thousand
objects let's say I wanted to create a
part of the system in some sort of like
a game like write a part of the system a
thousand objects is nothing yeah you
need 10,000 10,000 plus lines of code to
actually create all those objects those
those those little circles and then
change them and then figure out okay
well I have 10,000 lines of code all I
want to find maybe 500 of those I want
to actually change the particle move if
for only 500 of those circles you could
clearly see that you're gonna be just
lost hunting hunting down going to
attend doesn't lie so good yeah it's
takes way too much time it's not an
efficient used to your time it's kind of
slow down your computer if you have all
these things and you try and change
things on the fly with you know 500
objects at a time or not objects 500
lines of code at a time you try and
change them on the fly it's gonna slow
down your computer and it's not going to
be a good experience for the user yeah
that's what counts in the end yeah and
development title increased all the time
increases if you ever want to change
anything you need to debug yeah that's
going to increase slowly increase of
your if you're working with other
developers they're going to hate the
investor that's true right like other
developers will say all right great you
created this gimme your coat to create a
dozen objects I need to work on the you
know the user interface now and they're
like holy cow you're just gave you ten
thousand lies a code this is not gonna
work people will talk behind your back
and be like has no abstraction your
object way yeah exactly and that's
that's not good slow now Jonah work i go
into like exactly how we be actually
covert you know this implementation to
more itachi warranted yeah absolutely i
mean you you guys have run into this
sort of thing before in CSS you don't
want to style things on the fly it's
really similar with object-oriented
programming in Python so rather than
creating those four lines of code that
you see here that mark highlighted we
can take this idea and create an object
for it
um so like we were talking about earlier
we'll make something like this this expo
marker except it's going to be on the
computer and this is circle so what you
know what do we think about what's like
the most general idea we think about
when you get a circle so what a circle
is a kind of shape right so when we're
talking about programming want to think
general and then more specific so we'll
start with making us shape because let's
say later on they want to make squares
yeah what no or we want to make and
cory's aerial dogs right yeah the shapes
the counter it's got a shape with dog
 but so you can still n make a
picture for Corey or actually draw out
the actual specific shape of a quarry
and you know there's options for you to
join the house yeah anything's possible
but it's only possible if you allow it
to happen later on so you want to be
forward thinking when you're programming
so we start with creating a shape class
um so let me go back to go here yeah so
I lost rapier claw shape so we started
defining this and our final version this
code and what what are some things that
define a shape so we can think about
where it is on the campus so I have
balls that move around the canvas and
they'll be in different spots that's
their position they're gonna have a
velocity which is going to be their
direction as well as the speed they're
going to certain width and height so we
all want to code all these things into
them so this is how we give it if you
look closely in the code here we
initialize it we whenever we create a
shape we want to initialize it and we're
going to pass in all these variables
that we just talked about we're going to
pass in the velocity with the height of
the color the canvas with the Canada's
height and then this x and y values so
we want to create these randomly because
we're just going to put them on the page
and make them do whatever they do and
then have the bounce around and then
it'll littell look fun in the end so the
way this works is we assign the x value
of this shape to a random
integer between 0 and the canvas with
minus the width of circle so this makes
sure that your circle is within your
canvas because you want to make sure
dirt circle is where it is so ensure
that you not be on the edge same thing
with the x value want to make sure it's
on the on the page itself now we
assigned width of the circle to all the
values that we created the height the
color and then also we pass in the
velocity as a list since it's going to
be two values you want to put in the
speed as well as the direction so
actually this is a piece or X of Y so
the list up battle callosity is X just X
and Y it's okay in X of Y ok ok ok it
tells you the direction and magnitude as
well ok so the x the x and y values can
give you the magnitude or edit direction
at a strange time press so and also i
just want to point out why my gucci we
assign lists velocity is that just self
the philosophy quills velocity here and
the reason why i said like with lists
like a nutter mutable objects get the a
quick pointers right so you passing a
pointer if they have a paisley back
passing a reference mm to that same
right oh look this is kind of a
technical down the same location memory
if you somehow change that it it things
started happening so whenever you want
to pass in a list or a tuple or anything
that is mutable make sure and if you
plan to change that and make sure that
you plan to only like really make sure
that it's that state is preserved patent
a copy of it and a trick a lot of Python
programmers will will do is like no use
of list a function to pass in the list
and that list function will quail on
tart a copy dedicate just for that one
object okay that's great mark actually
happen not about that yeah so that's why
i added in the comments like you need to
cut passing this or else cuz if you have
like if you're doing something in all
the velocities somehow they're all the
same me said like all of our objects are
sharing or pointing to the same but lost
okay whenever we're making a change for
one object
it affects the entire system so we
always need to make sure that we were
passing in the velocities that that will
only be um that's on that damn one
object any respect yeah yes
characteristic to that okay so this is a
big car back it's a great trick ya are
probably really necessary trick I just
want cool great so if you look further
down on this code we see some methods
that we define for this class shape so
when we use this shape we want to have
some functions that we can pull out of
it so we call it we can call these
getters and setters so when we want to
like point the saying we want to ask the
shape where it is we don't want to just
go in and pull out its shape we want to
have this function called get velocity
which will return that list velocity we
actually behind earlier yes of coffee as
well it's not the direct what else yeah
that's actually very dangerous see I
shouldn't do it that way cuz very r pro
right yeah so you want to you want to
pull out a copy of it so that you can
use that and change it or pass something
back in that's different without without
actually messing up the class itself we
also have a function here we can set the
velocity so this is going to be really
valuable when we want to set the initial
velocity of the circle but then also
later on if you want to change it then
we have getting the position of the of
the circle and then we also have a
function for setting the position of the
circle good anything else you want to
say about this I bookable oh great um
right so we have these animation methods
within the shape itself so we have
defined earlier the general idea of
animation but it's going to be a little
bit different for these circles itself
we want to have the shapes position
you're dating as we move through the
code so the way we do this is we take
that self X which is
tradition now we add to it the velocity
divided by the frames per second so this
gets a little bit technical here I'm i
wanna don't want to spend too much time
on it but it is going to be how we
update the function has to go through
how we update the shape as we animate it
you wanna talk a little bit more about
of the ice animates the the shape yeah
other than what we had before further
what we have for basically in a nutshell
how we think about it so like for every
update call I recalled because we're
calling this update function every few
minutes milliseconds at a time three
exactly this program is sixteen point 60
milliseconds per frame or / update so
every 60 milliseconds I'm going to
update the x position with a number and
this number is inspired by this velocity
and this velocity tell us because it
tells us a magnitude and direction and
it comes with me where I want to go and
cousin how fast i want to go in so
basically I yeah we're will have more
detail knows that tells you why are we
like / FPS but basically it just is a
it's a good way for us to like say give
it like a hundred velocity of 100 yeah
horror means 100 pixels per second
catcher I want I want you to move at 100
pics 0 pixels for a second in this case
if i divide this by FPS since working
the realm of milliseconds we need to
convert that yeah into the number of
pixels per frame joshing okay so
basically each time the frame updates
it'll be that much further is faster
yeah it's slow they'll be less pixels
per frame it's possibly more pictures
okay this yeah just well if you if
you're confused on that just I would say
just I recommend just to work it out on
pen and paper I've when I was developing
this day application there was a lot I
have to take a lot of those myself and
have to draw my vectors visual i
officially see oh my
so bill that makes it kind of fun with
this sort of programming yeah like
something a little bit differently than
you would otherwise mmm cool so let's
start in the Chinese sort of elapsed
yeah so now that we've defined a general
shape we can get a little bit more
specific and talk about the actual
circles that we're gonna pound Paige so
the fun part so we are going to inherit
the class shape so the way we do that is
we have circle and then within
parentheses we have shaped so this means
that all the methods all the all the
variables that we used in shape get
passed down to circle it is actually
very fishing yeah right cuz if I want to
change something in the shape i just i
don't need to change 10,000 things nope
so this actually helps you with the
maintaining your code base oh and yeah
it's instead of this was like maybe 30
lots of code we've reduced 10,000
possibly fun doesn't like up to 30 lots
of hell yeah so it's huge this is very
powerful when you're programming yeah so
what we can do with this is we actually
define a separate initially a
constructor method this in it here so
it's going to be a little bit different
than the shape object we're going
passing in the velocity with the height
color canvas width kemacite x and y all
that's the same but we're gonna change a
couple different variables in here so we
have the radius in the center so why why
does that matter um if you think about
circle what are the two things that
define it well yes sir that's better
yeah that's nice very actual really
important especially one diesel math
right exactly so whenever whenever
you're defining circle in a plane you
just wanna know where it is and how
there's radius is and that's good since
you know its radius you can know what
it's going to look like in the end so
the radius is going to be the width the
whole circle about it in half because
the
I'm twice three cylinder very exactly
which is the same as the width and then
its center is going to be the x value
plus the radius and then the Y value
I'll straight B's yeah so center right
here some people owe me two cookies
ivanka yeah let me uh what should we
call it out your charter so do this okay
we got some legal right here salil
powder so so it's soda from the top cool
so how things we should find a shape is
an X and it's the top left corner right
x and y when we define a shape in our
canvas system is actually the top left
corner so you're there you go okay we're
we're going low tech everyone this is
the top left corner cuz this is your X
amor this is our general shape this
topic smartphone so the information we
have is x 0 y but we want to know the
center here so how do we get to the
center from this little corner exactly
so you only know where the center is and
then where the radiances so I've gone
why not here which is centered on the
radius up to the top and that's the
purpose of fire circle oh so got that
right here so the way we can work
through this is um we have lady okay but
crystals for sale are still on twist on
the under camera cam here so we can find
the center by if you know where the x
value is and we add the radius that's
going to give us sorry that's the Y
value if you have a center here and
radius that's going to help us identify
the center based on that information i
pass in same thing with y value right
now the y value is 0 so we just add the
radius and that gives us the y value
from the top so
yeah so basically no you add picture why
you add in your radius here yeah and
then adding away this year and then so
are going here and then are going here
this is your center RR because if x and
y 0 so basically yes but that's what the
general find a center for four hands in
a circle getting an XY position in the
top left corner and again give up a few
is a little complex we move on to that a
little bit quickly yeah it's just I can
draw out and you'll be able to figure
out oh this makes sense okay again like
that's why you're the same one step the
best way to do this is yeah try it out
mess the math little bit put some
programs and break it try see what's
wrong try see what works and then you'll
get it right yeah so look at this sample
Coco will give you a little to give you
this out so let's switch to go again
okay so let's dive back into the code of
circle here so we can start creating
methods for this circle and one of the
most important ones that's actually to
put circles on the page is this create
random circle and it's going to help us
create a random circle with a randomized
size randomized velocity in a randomized
color so we have a few variables in here
that help define the maximum and minimum
with speeds some colors that mark to
find that you can change the different
colors too and then the way it is going
to be a random integer between those two
values that we defined nicety the same
as the width because it's a circle so
it's going to be a circular the velocity
is also going to be randomized between
the minimum and maximum that we created
the colors are going to be randomized
and then when we're done it's going to
return this circle with a velocity with
the color of height and then it's also
going to put it does actually put this
on the canvas this application dog
canvas with or is that just pulling out
the width of the canvas I would create
just going to kind of okay so it's gonna
it's gonna pass in the width and the
height of the canvas as well so this
create random circle is a method which
takes in the reference to the class and
actually doesn't belong to any object
that means we can just call it straight
out of the circle like sort of a life
basically I'll type to say yeah great at
least they call this in our divorce of
our code yeah and it was a great it is
yep so like when you're working with
turtle earlier in the course that was a
really similar one when you do turtle
turtle and it will draw turtle this is
the same thing is it going to be creator
items or circle that create random
circle and it's going to throw a circle
on the page and it's not going to be
it's not going to be any particular song
I belong to any particular object which
makes it very powerful useful um okay
and then like update draw both of that
yeah yeah so the final meant that we
have here is a draw function which helps
us actually taking the canvas object and
we'll draw a circle on that canvas
object so this goes back to the actual
canvas that's been created it takes that
that white square and then helps us to
draw a circle on it by pushing in the x
value the y value putting in where it's
going to be by using the width and the
height and then filling it using the
color that we defined and there's
anything for that i'm on talked about
for the update function to it because
the coral variety this is also override
the update function yeah so i hope this
but the shape oh yeah so shape has its
own an update function and it has we're
going to want something a little bit
different for circle class and it's
going to update in same way but then
we're going to move center of uh yeah
we're going to
as well according to the x value and
radius the Y value in the radius yeah
that's every time right every time you
update the x and y changes yah your
Center needs to update along with the
new x and y's yeah sorry so that's yeah
again just a tells you how we would use
method overriding good example case yeah
right here excellent and I think we have
an edge edge collision edge collision
alright so this is where the magic
happens um we want to have the circle
behave realistically but when it hits an
edge to bounce off in the way that's
believable um so the first thing we got
to do this is created an imaginary box
you have a canvas but we actually need
to create a box that will bounce back
the ball when it hits it so we created
aunty box that covers a circle itself so
when that when that circle it's the
ballot box of the square then that's how
we know the collision happened now we
can make the bounce happen so safer an
edge on the campus if edge is at or
beyond the edge of the cannabis sorry if
the edge of the circle is at or beyond
the edge of the canvas we can say that
the edge collides and therefore we can
change the velocity to have the object
bounce back or the inside of the canvas
so uh you have it up oh yeah collision
all right here okay cool so play we can
check it is we pass in the the object
passing a canvas canvas within the
canvas height so we check the top and
the bottom edges and if the object y is
less than or equal to 0 that means it's
hit the upper left corner of the canvas
and then if you want to check whether
the bottom of the bounding box clydes at
the bottom edge of the canvas we do the
Y value of the object plus the object
height and check whether that's greater
than or equal to the
canvas height and then we know that it's
hit the bottom um so so what happens
when we hit the edge how do we set the
bounce back okay oh yeah so when you hit
the edge you want to change the velocity
of the function and the way that
balancing works we just want to change
the Y value let's say it's down let's
say it's bouncing up if we hit at the
top yeah Mon to bounce down so basically
we're changing the y velocity from some
that's positive time is negative yeah
we're just a verse in verse if ya and
then what exactly yeah so if its melting
down it's going to be I could even going
back up so it's having an inverse so we
want to change the velocity of the Y to
something that's negative of the
velocity of why yeah it's going to flip
that change I'm going to do that also
with the ex of it's moving sideways and
now we're going to change it when it
hits the edge and I'll bounce straight
back so this means that if we're moving
even obliquely it's going it it's going
to help change it in the way that's
exactly opposite the way that it came in
there goes to x and y are both change
jump both universe so it will go back
because this goes here hits it'll just
go here yep and yeah that's actually
very straightforward and sorry sorry for
a lot of people get tripped up with a
good a big a boy I'll do it you
delicious if what if it's spinning no
it's not the way you gotta worry about
this as I where we again like how
program does works like you can get this
big broad big problem just decomposed
into like small little components and
then just deal with small things one at
a time like say just collision on the
campus you don't need to worry about
collisions in the sort of flip circles
know or even if it's spinning like it
was like say what's the angular velocity
or any little man that's so I'm like
okay well that's a whole different
function to check for to make sure okay
if it's spinning okay I need to my
update function catches be okay if my
pictures I need to help it in my my
function based on both vectors
of are not inspector here also that's
this angular back your hair so like yeah
I need to like figure out how to how to
do that and that's all take physics mark
that's that's all physics really so this
is actually a real world application of
physics and this is how you really model
things that's that's really you know
this really if you're interested in game
programming yeah this is huge this is
where you need to start thinking about
how to take abstractly in terms of 2d
space and food space and also understand
the physics of objects when you get
collide let me spin all the things that
you talked about when you're modeling
system in the fiscal world we use that
to model our systems in the computer in
the computers just an FYI for our people
who are interested in game developed and
actually programming game engines and
this is this is a good sneak peek yeah
oh sorry you're gonna be doing longus
yeah a lot of other raise a lot of
vector is a lot of cosine based
vengeance yeah lots of vector
decompositions lots of linear algebra to
that chemical is not good stuff so what
almost all times so let's bring it all
together now yes so let's go back to
stirring so in this code we have all
these objects and let's go back to
actually crew you know really the basis
of like how this application works you I
create my wishes to create my campus
object and then i create my circles and
then I animate them so let's go back to
create canvas options so I'm going to
create 10 random circle to bounce around
so basically I just have a for loop and
then I tell them okay I have a list that
has it's a journalist contains a
reference of reference to all my circle
objects so basically i'm going to for
every iteration i'm going to create
around a circle oh and then add it into
my my memory and i'll be able to access
it later on it's not easy is that easy
so basically i can go i could do a good
i can do this oh my god fine yes that's
it so ten thousand objects all right
that's great i will probably
I in my memory or never I'll just go
back to huh Ted so let's just be let's
let's do 50 for now you're crazier I'm
crazy so then the animate think it's
it's still update all of the off
function see update oh yeah the update
on the regional functions or slightly
different cuz now for every object that
I have created in my update all I will
do i'll check that whether that object
has collided okay change the chase of
velocity i added i added a feature
feature to check for a circle collision
so if the circles is the the balls
collide with one another they should
react and bounce away from a nerd but
that has not been implemented like yet
so and so i'll show you how one looks
like if you actually implement it it's
good in this code and you just call
update like okay I'm just going on after
all my after i calculate all of my
collisions i'm going to update the
position and based on the new factors
that I've cuddly same thing is in we
draw here as you can see for every
object I'm just going to draw the object
that's that's great it's a very simple
way for me to eat team communicate with
you what I'm doing yeah so hopefully I
want to understand okay in terms of uh
object see sorry that's okay in terms of
object I hope range though screeching
hello I need to quote that messaging oh
let's say oh let's go back and just we
screen share that this I'm gonna show
you
turn screen whoa whoa recursion so
basically like if we so it's yeah it's
just a way for me to draw and talk in
terms of very intuitive ways when I'm
talking with a net programmer or what
I'm trying to think abstractly in terms
of how am i moving these objects are
just draw them I'm going to check with
collisions I'm going to change them and
then you see you ask track all the
details away so you think the code is
very beautiful yeah and very may table
if you want to get something else and do
it right here and that's not that much
harder yeah so I do more objects or
different objects you can append
different sorts of objects and once you
create them yeah so it's like easy makes
life easy so this is sha disorder 50
random objects I where Adam circle sorry
so it works still works pretty well it's
the cool stuff and let's see them little
pull the code for work zip code or
things around the bus route final so
basically this one will have oops the ce
o-- line intersects there's a typo ok
bonus round here you go there you go so
once you've like update your the
function to do object to object
collision this what it will look like
and this is the secret the key of
actually trick and what you're doing
this like you can't match in procedural
program you have to literally check
every single object and literally
calculate the collisions and the vectors
for every single object at every single
time at any given point of time there's
no point in having computers if you had
to do that yeah so you make you get the
computer to actually have that for you
so with object-oriented programming you
just pay
to the program like that object itself
will say I have a function I'm going to
look out for myself if I could fly with
anyone else I'm gonna change my my
factors and my path based on my own
collision my old what so you don't need
to like think about it from a top-down
or poetry they could think about it from
watching my bottom up bottom based
approach entities like options these um
yeah these objects are self-contained
and they they kind of act on your home
this you know it says this kind of like
here program you're an army of things
that could like how to say pick and act
like it all with you having not having
to track every single thing you just
give them guideline it's just getting
guidelines and then them then they'll
just go ahead and do it about it sucks
so that is the hopefully this gives you
a good really good application to play
around and also to think about
object-oriented programming so do you
have any less than a box Jonah on a
bunch of program in general or what we
did I was really cool start I thought
that that analogy to the video game
programming is really good I mean
object-oriented program is going to be
important in anything that you do your
brush again is a big project any even
even in life and good life whoa you know
think a little bit bigger here it's good
to you know isolate certain tasks like
let's say let's say like in the mornings
I'll go through and do little reviews
but I have that you know isolated its
own task and then like think points out
like oh this this reviewer needs to have
an email it's already predefined set of
tasks I don't have to think through it
every single time yeah there's little
things I change each time yeah it you
know do you think about abstraction and
a greater sense it's which it's useful
to apply to a lot of different things
that's kind of cool to see I can apply
here right yeah so my final bosses
object-oriented program is a little
weird at first but it's at the I'll say
at the end if you're taking big you
you're basically programming the
computer take care of all the little
details for you and make a system that
they like each object will be able to
take care of itself and if they it knows
what it needs to do on its own and it
knows how to update its own mistake you
don't need to literally go through you
know all your objects every time a state
chain there's one change of state for
one object you you just programmed that
in a way that the object itself will
take care of itself that's a nice
computer powerful yeah then look that's
that's a really powerful way of thinking
and you what's he getting it will stick
it won't go away oh okay race huh take
everyone and wonderful comment staying
and we'll post our notes in this example
go so you be able to play round it
yourself okay see you guys next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
