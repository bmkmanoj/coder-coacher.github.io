second example comes along and the red
outline for this example means there is
a negative example so now the agent will
try to find a way of specializing the
most general model and generalizing the
most specialized model in order to
account for this negative example so
given this negative example we want to
specialize the most general model so
that this negative example is excluded
and yet each of these specializations is
a generalization of this most specific
model because this was coming from a
positive example we do want to include
this let's first specialize in a way so
that the each specialization is a
generalization of this model there are
four ways of doing it because they are
four slots here the first slot here deal
to the name of your restaurant like Sam
so Kim's one specialization of this most
general concept is to put the name of an
actual restaurant there this is a
generalization of this contract because
this was referring to one specific need
exams this is referring to any meal at
sams in a similar way I can specialize
the filler at the second slot instead of
having any meal I can make it a break
fast meal this is a specialization of
this most general concept there is a
generalization of this concept because
this refers to breakfast at any place
this refers to breakfast at sams on
Friday and so on similarly for the third
slot and the fourth slot in this most
general concept now I must look at these
specializations of the most general
concept and ask which one of them should
I prune so as to X through the negative
example i noticed that Sam's doesn't
match Kim's so this is already excluded
and so far as this concept is concerned
breakfast doesn't match lunch so this
example is already excluded and so far
as this concept is concerned however
this conceptual characterization admits
this negative example therefore I must
prove it so we prove away that
particular conceptual characterization
and now we are left with three
specializations of the most general
model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
