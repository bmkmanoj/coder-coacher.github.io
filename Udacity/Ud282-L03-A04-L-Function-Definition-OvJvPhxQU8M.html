program a karaoke machine we want to
print out the lines of a song and group
together the lines for the chorus in a
function so that we can easily repeat it
here's the print code for the chorus of
the blondie song heart of glass that we
wanted to repeat now let's actually
write out the function definition for
printing this chorus will write the
words public void and then the name of
our function the name of a function can
be anything and we'll call this one
chorus with empty parentheses and
finally we'll surround the code we want
to execute these for print lines in
curly braces and this completes our
function definition for chorus the start
of this function looks like the start of
the print line function we've seen
before with the words public and void
these starting words may seem a bit
confusing at first so let's go through
what we just wrote piece by piece the
first thing we wrote was public Java
functions always start out with a word
like public or private and this is
called an access modifier and public
tells our computer that anyone can
access this function we'll learn more
about this later when we talk about
objects so for now just know that's
included at the start of a function the
next thing we wrote was the word void
and this is something called a return
type and void just means that this
function is not returning any data some
functions perform calculations and will
want them to return a final result or a
final piece of data to us and then this
word void will change to something else
but for functions that simply perform
actions like printing text we aren't
forming a new result and we don't expect
to return anything and we'll learn more
about return types soon so don't worry
about this too much after void we just
have the name of our function chorus
followed by empty parentheses which is
how we can refer to and call our
function and finally we have the block
of code that our function contains it
contains the printed lyrics code by
surrounding it with curly braces this is
similar to how our if statements contain
code inside braces now every time this
function chorus is called
this block of code will be executed and
these are all the components of a
function definition our next step after
defining this function will be to use it
by calling the function which we'll see
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
