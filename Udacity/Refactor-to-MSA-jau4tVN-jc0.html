application into micro-services ideally
we want to break our monolith around
functionality that's self-contained so I
created an auth and health service each
service is its own binary let's build
and run both of them now and see what
it's like to work with the new
application deployment I'm going to
start with the hello service in a new
shell tab I'll do the same for the off
service now that I have both services
running I can use the curl command in a
new shell to interact with the auth and
hello micro-services now that we have
multiple binaries to manage for our
application our deployment has been made
twice as complex and now our client's
need to know how to talk to two separate
services the additional complexity only
grows as the number of services for an
application increases this problem is
exactly what's driving the adoption of
application containers and management
platforms like kubernetes to coordinate
them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
