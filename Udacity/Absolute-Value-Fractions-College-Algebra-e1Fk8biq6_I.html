with each of the functions you might
notice that two of these graphs actually
didn't change at all from the way they
looked when their corresponding
functions didn't have absolute value
signs of them those two graphs are B and
C so what does this mean well you'll
note that in both functions G and K the
absolute value signs appeared around X
Squared's now we know that x squared on
its own is always going to be positive
so taking the absolute value sign of a
positive number doesn't do anything to
change its value that's why these two
graphs don't change at all compared to
the old versions when we put absolute
value signs around the denominator of
the function 1 over X we can see that
the branch that used to be down here
with negative x and negative Y values
got flipped across the x-axis so now
it's Y values are positive I think that
graph d might actually be the most
interesting change of these four before
we just had a straight line this is
basically just the function f of X
equals 1 a constant function but now our
numerator will always be positive but
once we move over into the negative x
values the denominator will be negative
a positive divided by a negative makes a
negative which is why this half of the
line got reflected across the x-axis to
become negative pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
