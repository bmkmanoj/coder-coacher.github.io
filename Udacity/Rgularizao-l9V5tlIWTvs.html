regularization is in regression
regularization is a method for
automatically penalizing the extra
features that you use in your model so
let me make this a little bit more
concrete there's a type of regularized
regression called lasso regression and
here's the rough formula for a lasso
regression a regular linear regression
would say I just want to minimize the
sum of the squared errors in my fit I
want to minimize the distance between my
fit and any given data point or the
square of that distance what lasso
regression says is yeah we want a small
sum of squared error but in addition to
minimizing the sum of the squared errors
I also want to minimize the number of
features that I'm using and so I'm going
to add in a second term here in which I
have a penalty parameter and I have the
coefficients of my regression so this is
basically the term that describes how
many features I'm using so here's the
result of this formulation when I'm
performing my fit I'm considering both
the errors that come from that fit and
also the number of features that are
being used and so let's say I'm
comparing two different fits that have
different number of features in them the
one that has more features included will
almost certainly have a smaller sum of
the squared error because it can fit
more precisely to the points but I pay a
penalty for using that extra feature and
that comes in the second term with the
with the penalty term and the
coefficient of regression that I'm going
to get for that additional feature that
I'm using and so what this is saying is
that the gain that I get in terms of the
the precision the goodness of fit of my
regression has to be a bigger gain than
the the loss that I take as a result of
having that additional feature in my
regression so this precisely formulates
in a mathematical way the trade-off
between having small errors and having a
simpler fit that's using fewer features
and so what lasso regression does is it
automatically takes into account this
penalty parameter and in so doing it
helps you actually figure out which
features that are the ones that have the
most important effect on your regression
and once it's found those features
it can actually eliminate or set to zero
the coefficients for the features that
basically don't help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
