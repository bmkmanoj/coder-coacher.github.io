erosion dilation are primitives and it's
a erosion followed by a dilation okay so
that's what a opening is and it says
here you can show that an opening of
something of a by B is the union of all
the translations that fit entirely
within a that's kind of complicated and
wordy it must easier to see in a picture
so here's our binary thing a and this is
our structuring element B and the
opening is all the places all the
translations within a that you can fit B
and when you do that you would get out
this thing here and you'll notice that
it has broken the connection between
those two triangles and it's also
rounded the edges so it's not surprising
that it's broken them because it's too
small and the whole thing doesn't fit
there and the rounding is because of the
shape with B it says here and you
notices a slide the opening is the area
that we can paint when the brush has a
footprint of B and we're not allowed to
let the brush get outside of the
original image a one of the other cool
things is if you take a look at this if
I now have this shape I were to open
with B again well it fits everywhere
inside of there so it wouldn't change
right that is if I kept going it would
stay the same and that's referred to as
is ident or idempotent I don't know you
pronounce it I know how to spell it it's
an operation that when you repeat it it
makes no change so if you road and then
dilate you get something well if you
didn't Road and dilate again you're not
going to make any changes which is not
the same as saying if you were to row to
row to Road and dilate that i dilate
there that would be the same as a road
and dilate so you got that
so repeated openings which are a road
dilate a road diet that doesn't buy you
anything more but sometimes you want to
erode either multiple times or the
bigger shape things and then in dilate
again so let me show you an example of
using opening for like that cell colony
thing we're talking it's a different
picture but the same idea so here we
have this Thomas
thank you very much at an Albert so
here's an original image okay of some
cells that are growing here is a binary
image okay and this is the opening using
a 11 pixel disc alright and you see that
it pulls out you know these cells pretty
well and when you come over here you say
okay so it's got that one it's got that
one it's got that one it's got that one
it's got that one it's got that one it's
got that one it's got that one and you
know clearly maybe it misses this one
all right maybe it misses this one so
this tends to be common in sort of these
kinds of things you can find some
operation which tend to pull out what
you want but it's not going to be
perfect all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
