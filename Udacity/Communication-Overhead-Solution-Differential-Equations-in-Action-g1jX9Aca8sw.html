and I'll explain why the total amount of
computation to be done is proportional
to its create the number of cells in the
domain so if we have n squared cause or
processors the amount of work for each
of these is proportional to N squared
over N squared which means that the
first term describes the time taken by
the computation alone but then the
processors or the cause have to exchange
data at the boundaries at that and the
amount of that data is proportional to n
minus 1 we have n minus 1 vertical
boundary lines and n minus one
horizontal boundary lines and it's
proportional to L because we have eight
cells along each boundary lines so of
these expressions second one makes most
sense footnote when we use this
expression you'll find that the optimum
number of processors is proportional to
the cube root of the number of cells l
squared this is a little surprising on
first sight you may expect that the
optimum number is proportional to the
number of sales not proportional to its
cube root this relationship is easy to
verify by looking at the minimum of this
expression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
