common cognitive task you and I appear
to do it all the time we can use a chair
to prop up on a door and we can build a
very quick explanation provided chair is
a good prop we can use a coffee mug to
hold a pile of papers and provide an
explanation for why the coffee mug would
act as a good paper weight of course
there is a lot more to it than we have
discussed so far explanation based
learning is centred knowledge based here
in cognitive science because we are
trying to build human-like human level
intelligence explanations and
explanation based learning know very as
prominent in other schools of AI second
note that humans are not very good at
explaining everything we can only
explain those things which appear to be
consciously accessible we have a hard
time explaining memory processes for
example or we have a hard time
explaining certain kind of physical
actions for example when I play tennis
my feet move the way they do and I can't
explain to you why I cannot make them
move better third although we can
generate explanations this does not
necessarily mean that our process for
generating explanation is the same
process that we use to arrive at the
decision in the first place explanations
can be post hoc further the very act of
genetic explanations can interfere with
the reasoning process however when we
can generate explanations it can lead to
much deeper much richer understanding
and learning because it exposes the
causal connections finally for AI
systems to be accepted into society they
must be below generate good explanations
you for example will be unlikely to
accept the advice of a medical
diagnostic system if the diagnostic
system cannot explain its answers it
must be able to explain is answers as
well as the process it reuse to arrive
at those answers explanation is
fundamental to trust</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
