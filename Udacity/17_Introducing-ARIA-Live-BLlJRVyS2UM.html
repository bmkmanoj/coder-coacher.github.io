part of the page as live innocence that
updates should be communicated to users
in a timely manner rather than if and
when they happen to explore that part of
the page one example might be a status
message which appears as a result of
either a user action or an external
event if this message is important
enough to grab a sighted users attention
we can direct an assistive technology
uses attention to it by setting an aria
live attribute on it when an element has
an aria live attribute we refer to the
part of the page containing it and its
descendants as a live region Aria live
has three allowable values off polite
and assertive off is the default value
it can be specified explicitly if need
be but not setting an aria live
attribute at all will have the same
effect Aria live equals polite tells us
if technology alert the user to this
change when you finished whatever you
are doing
it's greater use if something is
important but not urgent and accounts
for the majority of Aria live use in
this example we have a chat widget which
uses Aria live to reflect the most
recent chat activity when a new chat
message appears it'll be announced to a
screen reader user once any in progress
uh pterence has finished Aria live
equals assertive tells us this if
technology to interrupt whatever it's
doing and alert they use it to this
change immediately this is only for
important and urgent updates such as a
status message like there has been a
server error and your changes are not
being saved please refresh the page or
updates to an input field as a direct
result of a user action such as buttons
on a step of widget in this case once
this alert bar has some content
it'll interrupt whatever the user was
doing with an announcement of its
content to demonstrate this in practice
here's a demo of Aria live use in the
custom number input you can see the Dom
for the custom number input on the right
we have a container element with a roll
of spin button then a span containing
the numerical value and an add and
subtract button the span with a numeric
value has an aria live value of
assertive meaning whenever it changes
whatever speeches in progress should be
interrupted one other thing to notice is
I've used aria
described by to associate the element
with this bit of help text underneath so
I'll probably hear that once I set focus
on the element I'm gonna turn on current
box light tab to the element and then I
should hear the label and it's gonna
start reading the description then I'm
gonna use the up arrow to add 10 to the
value number input demo current value
spin button use add and subtract buttons
or up and down arrows 10 great so it
immediately told me the new value and
interrupted what it was saying I can do
that again 20 or use the mouse 30 2000
screenreader Add button 30 and the same
thing happens so those are the basics of
aria-live we have just a couple of tips
for working with aria-live regions in
practice firstly your aria-live region
should probably be in the initial page
load this is not a hard and fast rule
but if you're having difficulty with an
aria live region this could be one of
the issues secondly different screen
readers and assistive technologies
reacts differently to different types of
changes for example it's possible to
trigger an alert on some screen readers
by toggling a descendant elements hidden
style from true to false but this
technique does not work on others so if
you're having issues with getting an
aria leverage and to speak experiment
with some different types of content
changes to see what works on the
platforms you're targeting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
