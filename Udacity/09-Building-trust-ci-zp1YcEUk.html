features or lots of people who are
building really amazing products
everything about my language is talking
about like how do I make it so the user
feels like they're kicking ass right
because a lot of people like who are
great building stuff they're like they
talk about features like look what we
have look what look what we're doing
look why this is awesome this is going
to be really cool right and it needs to
be the complete opposite where it needs
to be like look use this this is what's
going to kick ass and so it's all about
the language and the features like I can
say you get a thousand entries unlimited
forms you get payment integration right
but that's just listing the features
what I need to say is like look you
don't have to worry about data
collection anymore everyone your
departments going to have this soft on
there you get to make money off of this
monetize like in a couple of seconds
instead of having wait for paying like
thousands of dollars so we build a
custom ecommerce site for you beta test
certain issues user management like all
that stuff has to be turned around when
you're talking about those features so
that took us a while to understand like
okay the motivations on why people want
to be on certain plans and making sure
it got communicated you being on here
the reason you're on here is because of
this because it's all for you and that
takes a real sort of empathy in terms of
describing and sort of a knack for copy
that's a flip side of how people think
about things because like entrepreneurs
are really good about talking about
themselves I'm pitching their company
all that stuff but a lot of times they
don't realize like the pitch you need to
give is the pitch that allows people to
talk about you to someone else it's like
I use this and it's my secret weapon I'm
sharing it with you now and I'm now like
your most interesting for sense of
dinner table or you gave this tip that
like makes you look like the really
awesome guy and so a lot of people just
don't even craft copy in a way that can
be disseminated that easily a lot of
times they'll just use weird like
slogans or tag lines or short phrases
and stuff and it's like I can't repeat
that to someone and it make any coherent
sense on why you should use the service</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
