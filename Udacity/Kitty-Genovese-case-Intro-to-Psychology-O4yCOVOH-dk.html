a part of our lives however on the
bright side we also see that as humans
we engage in pro-social behavior we
would like to start this part of the
lesson by going back to the first lesson
on what is psychology do you remember we
talked about kitty Genovese recall that
kitty Genovese was walking home to her
apartment after work late one night and
a man attacked her outside of her
apartment building she screamed and
people turned their lights on then the
attacker ran away however nobody called
the police next the attacker returned
and people heard more screams and still
nobody called the police and then in the
end he ended up killing kitty how is it
that such a long drawn-out murder can
happen and so many people can hear the
attack and yet no one well one person
out of 38 even so much as calls the
police to answer this question to
researchers Darlie and Latin a designed
an experiment to study what they came to
call the bystander effect let's take a
closer look at how the study was
designed the researchers had
participants who were talking to each
other via headsets it turns out that the
recordings were actually pre-recorded
and the participant was interacting with
those pre-recorded conversations in
addition the group size is varied some
thought that they were alone with one
other person others thought they were in
larger groups next some time during the
conversation the participant heard
someone choking now remember this was
pre-recorded but the participant did not
know that now before we move forward
with the results what would you do in
that type of situation you don't have to
type an answer but think about it for a
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
