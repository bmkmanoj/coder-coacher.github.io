optimal pig strategy so we need a Q&amp;amp;A
you function and an actions function
let's get started on that the Q function
will call q pig it takes a state and an
action and evaluates the quality of that
against the utility function and what
should we use for the utility function
well I think the best thing to use is
the probability of winning because we
get one point for winning and no points
for losing that's a good way of thinking
about the game and so our expected
outcome is going to be somewhere between
zero and one and that's like a
probability and so the probability of
winning is our score if we win all the
time probability of scoring of winning
is one then that should be worth one
point if we win none of the time that
should be where zero points so our
utility is just the probability of
winning and what is that well if we hold
then we're turning it over to our
opponent and we still have our hold and
roll functions that tell us what state
we get to when we hold and then it's our
ponents and he's going to do his best so
our utility would be 1 minus the
opponent's utility what he can do best
his probability of winning because
either one player or the other has to
win so our probability of winning is 1
minus our opponents probability of
winning if we roll it's more complicated
if we roll a 1 then we pig out and it's
1 minus our opponents probability of
winning because it's his term and
otherwise we just take all the
possibilities for the other die rolls
and it's our probability of winning from
the result of rolling in that state and
that six probabilities all together so
we have to average them so we add them
all up and divide by 6 and if the action
wasn't hold or roll I'm going to raise
evaluator what are the actions in a
state well if there's some pending
numbers I can roll or hold and if
they're not I'm just going to roll
that's the only thing that makes sense
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
