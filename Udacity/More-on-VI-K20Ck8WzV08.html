contraction mappings make it so that
value iteration converges you know in
the limit that we end up solving the
bellman equations I'm not going to want
to say too much more about value
duration but on one slide I want to at
least summarize a couple interesting
things that are worth knowing all right
so here's the first one if you think
about Q T star so that's the Q function
that we get if we run value duration 40
* iterations okay we know that it
converges in the limit we know that that
QT eventually goes to Q star and here's
kind of an interesting thing that we
know about the finite horizon so there
is some T star less than infinity that's
polynomial in the number of states the
number of actions the magnitude of the
rewards in the reward function the
number of bits of precision that are
used to specify the transition
probabilities and one over one minus
gamma so that if we run valuation for
that many steps the Q function that we
get out is Q sub T star of sa if we
define a policy is a which is just the
greedy policy with respect to that Q
function that policy is optimal okay so
what we're saying here is that we know
that in the limit if we run value
iteration for an infinite number of
steps then the Q function that we get
out at that point the greedy policy with
respect to that Q function is optimal
but what this is saying is that there is
some time before infinity where we get a
Q function that's close enough so that
if you do the greedy policy with respect
to it it really is optimal like all the
way a hundred percent optimal so what
that really means is it's polynomial and
the things you would expect to matter
and so that's saying that you can
actually solve this in a reasonable
amount of time yeah I mean anytime I see
the word polynomial I'm like okay what
you're saying is this is reasonable yeah
now the trick in this particular thing
the reason it's not just polynomial is
this one over one minus gamma so as
gamma gets close to one this blows up
and that's not polynomial e bounded in
say the number of bits it takes to write
down gamma so it really is exponential
and in terms of the number of bits it
takes to write down the whole problem
but but even so you know if you take
gamma to be some fixed constant then
over 1 minus gamma might be really big
but it's some fixed constant and we're
polynomial in all the rest of this stuff
so what this really all boils down to is
the idea that once you fix an MVP and
the number of bits of precision that
you're using to write it down then
there's going to be some optimal action
and there might be other actions that
are tied for optimal in any given state
but the second best action is going to
be some actual bounded amount away from
optimal so it can't get arbitrarily
close to optimal it's going to be some
distance away and what that gives us is
that when we run value iteration enough
eventually the distance between the best
action and the second Bex action gets
bigger than that gap and once it's
bigger than that gap then the greedy
policy is going to be optimal it's going
to choose the actual optimal action in
all states so VI converges and it
converges in a reasonable amount of time
well not that it converges in a
reasonable out of time it the greedy
policy with respective value duration
converges in kind of a reasonable amount
of time okay that's a much better way of
saying it okay by that this turns out to
be a consequence of Cramer's rule which
we're not going to talk about but this
is why once we write down everything
with polynomial precision that we are
guaranteed to get some fixed size gap
between the best and the second best
it's always amazing me how you managed
to get Seinfeld into our conversations
Cramer rules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
