times this cube root of five for the
fourth root of 48 we have two times the
fourth root of 3 and for the fourth root
of 64 we have two times the fourth root
of four and finally for our last answer
we'll have five times the cube root of
20 fantastic work for getting at least
three of those correct these were pretty
tough for the first one we can rewrite
40 as eight times five eight is the same
thing as 2 cubed so now we have a
perfect cube or a factor that appears
three times within our radical we can
use the product rule to split this
radical up into the product of two
radicals we know that a cubed root
undoes a cube power so we're really left
with just 2 here this also goes in line
with our thinking a power divided by
root 3 divided by 3 equals 1 so we just
have 2 to the 1 we can't simplify the 5
so that stays inside of its cubed root
and we have that multiplied on the end
with our answer 2 times the cube root of
5 for the 4th root of 48 we split up 48
into 16 times 3 we rewrite 16 as 2 to
the 4th and then we can take the 4th
root of 2 to the 4th the root undoes the
4th power we leave the 3 inside of the
4th root since we don't have 4 factors
of 3 we just have one of them so our
final answer is 2 times the 4th root of
3 we use a similar method for finding
the 4th root of 64 we rewrite 64 as 16
times 4 take the 4th root of 2 to the
4th which leaves us with 2 times the 4th
root of 4 for our last one we split up
2500 into 25 times 125 equals 5 squared
and 100 equals 5 times 20 we do this
step so that way we can get 3 factors of
5 together we know that the cube root of
5 cubed is just 5 20 is not a perfect
cube
since the factors of 20 are 2 2 &amp;amp; 5
there's not three factors that repeat
this means 20 stays inside of our cube
root and we're left with our final
answer 5 times the cube root of 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
