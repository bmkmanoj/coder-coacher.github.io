powerful tool to direct attention and
provide cues about how something works
but as hell spider-man fans know with
great power comes great responsibility
motion needs to be used purposefully and
judiciously here are some practical tips
for designing motion that enhances the
experience rather than detract from it
let's start off with some basics how
long should your animations run for
here's some examples the first one here
is too slow the animation feels
gratuitous the second one is too fast it
feels almost accidental the third is
just right animations should be slow
enough to convey their meaning but as
fast as possible so that they don't get
in the way and become annoying a good
rule of thumb is to use animations that
are around 300 milliseconds long and
tweak from there if they feel too slow
or too fast remember that in general
designers and developers alike tend to
use animations that are longer than
users would prefer so if you think you
need one full second for an animation
you probably actually need a lot less to
get the point across and another tip
where possible use the size of the
object than the distance it needs to
move to help you time the animation this
will make sure that animations that can
have varying start and stop states feel
right in every situation now that we
know how long animations should run for
let's talk about interpolation in the
real world objects don't start or stop
moving instantaneously like in this red
circle they accelerate and decelerate to
get from point A to point B now material
design takes this a step further motion
curves in material are asymmetric
meaning as objects move their
acceleration and deceleration aren't
equal for objects that move across the
screen you can use a fast out slow in
transition because most of the movement
happens early on items spend more of the
transition near their final position the
effect is that animations feel fast and
sighs this also reduces a lot of the
negative effects that can come from too
much motion and when elements are
entering or exiting the scene do so at
full velocity for objects entering the
linear out slow in interpolator works
well for this for objects exiting you
can use the fast out linear in
interpolators finally let's talk about
the notion of user initiated change this
is really really important in material
design almost all state changes start
with something the user does user input
such as touch and keyboard focus is thus
at the very center of the motion story
material design here's an example
similar to what we saw in lesson two
notice how the surfaces respond to touch
by lifting up and showing temporary ink
ripples coordinating motion around the
users touch point makes complex state
changes easier to visually process and
understand in this example when
transitioning between two states
animations across the screen are
staggered based on their distance from
the touch point the result is that the
motion feels more intentional and
connected to you it makes you feel
powerful and in control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
