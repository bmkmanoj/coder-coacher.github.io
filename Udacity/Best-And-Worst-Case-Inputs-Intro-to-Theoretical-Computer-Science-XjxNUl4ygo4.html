guarantees and also it sounds like it's
a very big simplification but the thing
is as long as we're still counting the
number of time steps of the algorithm
exactly even worst-case running time can
get pretty tricky and I'll give you one
example for this again we're going to
consider an algorithm that takes us
input a string of length n so what this
algorithm does is given a string of
length n it counts the number of times
that the sequence a B appears in that
string so it will iterate over the
length of the string and if it finds an
A it will look if the next character is
a B and if that is the case it will
increase the counter here so what I
would like you to consider for our next
quiz is what a worst case and a best
case input for that algorithm would look
like so here we have a number of
potential inputs and it doesn't really
matter how long those inputs are it's
more about their structure and if this
structure will cause the algorithm to
behave as it would in a worst case or in
the best case or something else and what
I would like you to do is for each of
those strings tell me if that string
will cause the algorithm to go into a
worst-case running time a best-case
running time or something else so for
each of those four strings I would like
you to tell me if those strings cause
the algorithm to have the best possible
running time or the worst possible
running time or something in between and
it doesn't really matter how long those
strings are it's their structure that I
want you to look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
