you next day and you'll note that I
start with a docstring this is treated
as a special common by most python
systems and I've put in this morning to
make sure that people realize this
implementation is not actually correct
so it shouldn't be used as scheduled say
the apocalypse but it's good for our
testing for now and the logic is quite
simple if the day is less than 30 since
we're assuming all month to have 30 days
we increase the day by 1 and I'm
returning a three tuple of the Year the
month in the day otherwise we need to
increase the month so we're gonna
advance to the next month reset the data
1 if we're in December then we need to
increase the year by 1 and reset the
date to January first as with a larger
problem you should start this by
thinking about some test cases and see
that those behave as expected we
provided some in the example one nice
thing you'll notice here using the
Python shell provided by idle is that
when I try to use next day I see the doc
string right here and normally we want
doc strings that are descriptive here
the warning is very useful and I give a
sample month day and year and I see that
I get the right result I should note
that for some cases say January 30th the
day following January 30th should be
January 31st I'm gonna get February 2nd
because of this assumption about all
months having 30 days and we should try
a more difficult case such as the end of
the year and here I'll use December 31st
it would advance the year whether it's
December 31st or December 30th because
of that assumption and we get January
1st 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
