importance in our lives in fact there's
no way around it that we experience
aggression in our lives and other
animals engage in aggressive behavior to
get the resources that they want so we
can define aggression as violent
behavior that is intended to cause
psychological or physical harm or both
to another individual or being now why
are we aggressive chances are were often
aggressive because we've been provoked
and when we engage in aggressive
behavior because we've been provoked by
feelings of anger we call that hostile
aggression I'll be honest with you and
share an experience of hostile
aggression that I had last week when I
was walking to campus I was crossing the
street and I had the walk sign and
another car came around it almost hit me
now as a frequent pedestrian this was
not the first time it almost happened to
me but I was very upset and I started to
yell at the driver and I had a few
choice words to say to him now my
hostility was limited in anger to
yelling at the person but in some cases
we see people may be more aggressive and
try to hit the person or chase after the
car in fact the term road rage has been
developed to explain such hostility that
drivers sometimes experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
