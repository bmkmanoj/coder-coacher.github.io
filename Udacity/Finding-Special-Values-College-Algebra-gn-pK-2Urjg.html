we substitute in special values of x
then make the function equal to zero and
I see that this connects directly to
factors now we're going to look at how
to find special values like a in this
case working backwards from we have
written here if we could look at a
function and find its factors then we
would know these special values so let's
figure out how to do that now you
already know how to factor quadratic
expressions and you had a lot of
practice with that earlier in the course
so let's see if we can look at another
function and use similar methods to this
to find one factor and then figure out
what that factor needs to be x to give
us the original function let's say we
have a function that's already in
factored form maybe it's f of x equals x
minus 6 times X plus 2 times X minus 4
if this is the case and we decide to
multiply this right hand side out and
then simplify what is the constant term
that will get now what you want to be
looking for here is a shortcut to do
this so you don't actually have to
multiply out everything think about
which combinations of terms here are
going to give us just constants</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
