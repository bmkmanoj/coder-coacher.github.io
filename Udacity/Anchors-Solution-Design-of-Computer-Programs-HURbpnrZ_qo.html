has got to be one character the a this
anchor we can't cover another anchor so
it's got to be 0 this anchor we can
include this if we want but we can't go
on to the other anchor so it's 0 to 1
and here we got to include the D but
nothing else so it's 1 now there's one
more thing about anchors I want to cover
which is how we deal with the words in
the other direction so for these five
anchors there are no letters in the
other direction and so these are
completely unconstrained and we say that
any letter can go into those spots but
in these two anchors there's adjacent
letters and it would be ok we can form a
word going in this direction but we can
do that only if we can also form a word
going in this direction and let's say
there are no more this is either the
edge of the board or the next row is all
blanks then we can say well what letters
can go here only the letters that form a
word when the first letter is that word
and the second letter is U and in our
dictionary it turns out that that
possibility is the set of letters m and
an X so mu nu and X you are all words in
our dictionary believe it or not
scrabble dictionaries are notorious for
having two and three letter words that
you've never heard of and similarly here
what are two letter words that end in y
it's the set MOA be and you've probably
heard it most of those so when we go to
place words on a particular row we can
pre-compute the crosswords and make that
be part of the anchor what we're going
to do is have a process that goes
through finds all the anchor points and
finds all the sets of letter whether
it's any letter for these five anchors
or whether it's a constrained set of
anchor letters for these two anchors
sounds complicated but we can make it
all work and let me say that once you've
got this concept the concept of the
anchor sets and the crosswords then
basically we're done we've done at all
we can handle a complete board no matter
how complicated and we can get all the
plays it's just a matter of implementing
this idea and then just fleshing it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
