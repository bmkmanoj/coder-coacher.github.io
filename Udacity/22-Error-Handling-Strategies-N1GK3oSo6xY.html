of dot catches like this one but there
are actually other ways these two chunks
of code are actually equivalent dot
catch is just shorthand for dot then
undefined and then a rejection function
notice how this then actually is taking
two arguments the full function
signature for then is actually this in
this form if any previous promise is
rejected the reject function gets called
if they resolve then the resolve
function gets called if there is no
resolve function and the promise before
this then resolves then this then gets
skipped over and the next then is called
in all cases as soon as a promise
rejects then the JavaScript engine skips
to the next reject function in the chain
whether that's in a dot catch or a dot n
so that means an error here in this
promise or here in this promise both get
caught by this catch both methods catch
and then with two callbacks work equally
well however it's actually recommended
that you use dot catch when you can
because dot catch is just easier to read
and write than a second dot then
callback which can be hard to spot in
fact you might not have even noticed it
right here that being said there is a
major difference in the execution order
between dot catch and a second callback
notice that you cannot call both the
resolve function and the reject function
if they're part of the same dot then
only one or the other or neither will
get called if something goes wrong with
the resolve function you'll need another
dot catch or another dot then farther
down the line to catch it but if you
have dot then and then a dot catch each
with their own resolve or reject
function both of them can possibly get
called and finally I want to make one
more subtle point it's also worth noting
that it isn't necessarily true that
passing a value to resolve means that
the promise succeeded this is a subtle
point so go see Jake Archibald blog post
in the instructor notes for more
information in the next quiz you'll be
thinking through the flow of a
of promises using different formats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
