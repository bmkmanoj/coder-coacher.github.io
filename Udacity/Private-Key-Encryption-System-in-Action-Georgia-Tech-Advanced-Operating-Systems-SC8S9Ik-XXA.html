and action two entities a and B have
exchanged keys a will use the key ka to
send a message to B and B can decrypt
the message using the same key ka and
similarly when b wants to send a message
to a it encrypts it let's say using
another private key KB and when the
message comes over here a will decrypt
the message using the same key that was
used for encryption namely Kb so one of
the things that should be obvious is
that in order for this private key
encryption system to work both the
entities need to know when they get an
encrypted message who is the author of
the message because that is the only way
they know what key to use in order to
decrypt this message so if a sends a
message to B it's sending this encrypted
message when this ciphertext arrives
here for B to know that it has to use
this key ka it needs to know the
identity of the sender so the identity
of the sender has to be sent in clear
text so this is the format of a message
that is going from A to B the identity
of the sender in clear text meaning that
looking at this B will immediately know
ah this message is from sender a and
therefore I should use key ka to decrypt
the ciphertext and vice-versa
when a gets a message from B of course
ka and KB can be the same or in other
words it is the same key that is used
for a to send a message to B as well as
for B to send a message to a but the
important thing to take away is that the
key that is used for encryption and
decryption of a given message is exactly
the same that's the idea behind the
private key encryption system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
