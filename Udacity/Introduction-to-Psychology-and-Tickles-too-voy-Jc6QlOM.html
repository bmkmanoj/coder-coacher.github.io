I'm Susan and I'm great
we're your instructors for this course
we're gonna take you on your journey
through psychology we'll go over
different areas of psychology and how
different psychologists examine and
explain thought and behavior we are all
very different we like different things
we think differently we even react
differently so for instance I have
something here might create different
reactions and people my pet snake
tickles I've come to really enjoy him
he's a nice snake
I wouldn't mind holding tickles or
touching him but I certainly wouldn't
want him as a pet Lauren no you don't do
snakes the perfect example of how people
react differently to different
situations so there's many different
areas of psychology for instance
personality psychologists would look at
what's going on here and try to really
understand individual differences and
the fear and why I'm not really afraid
you're fine and she's more or less
terrified behavioral psychologists might
look at an individual's learning history
so for example I was exposed to a lot of
snakes when I was growing up so perhaps
I've learned that snakes aren't
dangerous for me and a social
psychologists may look at how other
people's behavior influences our own so
for example looking at other people's
reactions may influence our own
reactions a biological psychologist
perhaps may look at Lauren's fright
response in terms of increase in heart
rate or even sweating and a
neuroscientist they may look at the
areas of the brain that are activated
during the fear response such as the
amygdala but for now I think it's time
for tickles to head home even though
this example exploited my favorite
snakes
thanks a lot Greg it was a really
effective tool for Susan and Greg to use
to show you just how diverse psychology
can be now psychology is defined as a
study of thought and behavior and it's
an amazing way to make sense of our
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
