here today you know that you're part of
a group of five individuals who are
participating in our genetics course and
we're here just sort of spotlight your
personal stories and you've been
selected and agreed to participate with
us because you have a very interesting
story of background because you are
adopted so what I'd like for you to do
if you can adjust walk us through a
little bit tell us tell us where you're
from which what your name is where
you're from where you grew up and you
know when you found out that you were
adopted for the first time and sort of
how that made you feel okay I'm sterling
tadlock and I grew up in Eastern North
Carolina in a really small rural
community about 50 minutes south east of
raleigh in a little town called Grantham
I was raised as an only child my dad was
a sheriff's deputy my mom was a
stay-at-home mom we lived a pretty
country a rural life you know we never
really traveled outside of the state and
I grew up as an only child thinking my
parents were my real parents which I
still classify them as my real parents
but yeah I didn't really any think think
anything about it until I got a little
bit older and sort of realized that you
know I don't really look like my parents
how old were you when that when that
happen I was probably you know probably
11-12 when I sort of noticed you know my
parents have different body shapes than
me I'm sort of tall slender they're not
and I always just sort of wondered you
know why is that and sort of just put it
to the back of my mind although I did
notice that my friends parents and their
siblings looked more similar than I look
to my parents mm-hmm but again I didn't
really question it because I didn't
really think anything of it did anyone
else ever point that out to you you know
not that I remember
I cannot I can't remember my parent
anyone any of my friends pointing that
out that I looked a lot different than
my parents but you know that was love
and warmth in the family and so that
sort of was secondary did you know of
anyone else in your family extended
rather why's it had been adopted or did
you have any other kinds of interactions
did you know anyone else either in or
outside of your family that had been
adopted um actually I had a distant
cousin that had been adopted by their
grandparents so it wasn't as far you
know removed as i am from my real
parents biologically sure uh that was
really the only exposure I had I never
really understood you know growing up
what adopted mint just because sex is
not talked about a lot in Eastern North
Carolina and the understanding of you
know where you come from from your
biological parents wasn't really ever
brought up so the concept of being
adopted also was never brought up so how
over you when you finally actually sort
of figured it out or someone talk to you
about it so it was a really interesting
story I was 14 and like most people in
Eastern North Carolina was raised in the
church church was a big facet of
everyone's life and I went to Sunday
school one day I was 14 and
coincidentally was Father's Day and in
church that day in sunday school lesson
the teacher was talking about how
whenever you become adopted or whenever
you become a Christian you become
adopted into gods family and he then
looked at me and he said so why don't
you tell the class what it feels like to
be adopted sterling and that sort of
struck maybe so I had never heard that I
was adopted before like I said I've
thought that you know I look a little
bit different than my parents and then I
saw pictures of me as a baby with my
parents and so you know
I just thought about it on saying no I
can't be adopted and I remembered there
was a girl a distant cousin of mine who
said sterling sada dot did those are his
real parents and so I sort of squashed
it in church although there was this
rumbling anxiety within me and then I
went to the sermon portion of church and
I SAT between my grandmother him i'll
refer to as me ma and my mama on the
other side and I'll leaned over to my
meemaw and I was like so am i adopted
and she didn't look at me she looked
kept looking straight at the pulpit and
she's like you're gonna have to ask your
mother about that and so then I turned
to my mom and I was like so I heard in
some of the school that I'm adopted and
she's like well you are and I just sort
of froze right there in the pew and I
just wasn't shocked I didn't really
react your first and then I just started
tearing up and crying and stood up and
just sort of left the church we I ran
out into the kitchen and my mother and
grandmother followed me and what was
going through your mind why why were you
upset what was did you know what was
making you upset about the time um it
was mainly that you know my concept of
what who my parents were and their
relatedness to me was different than
what I originally had thought of like
they weren't my biological parents and
then secondary to that though I had
biological parents out there that I
didn't know and then along with that was
the whole light may not knowing until
the age of fourteen like having this
perception that you know the mother and
father that I grew up with were not my
biological ones so did you feel
instantaneously more distant from them
or is this more of a it was a mixture in
that moment was a mixture of shock
anxiety a sort of sadness I also felt
and felt this guilt that my reaction
would in some way make my mother and
father that I grew up with my team I
refer to as my real parents them I would
make them sad by the
sad which is something I think a lot of
adopted children go through and is a
common thing that I've had like
emotionally when I sort of questioned
you know who my biological parents are I
think it's one of the sort of
disadvantages in a way of being adopted
is this notion of survivor's guilt where
there's a big disaster this is where the
term came from originally I believe
there's a big disaster and those that
survived the disaster feel guilty
because they're not the ones that been
injured or killed and when you're
adopted you feel like I was chosen you
know by my parents but there are plenty
other people who are still in the foster
care system who weren't adopted and you
feel like you should be grateful you
know that you were adopted and you
should be thankful every day that you
live that you have a family that you
know raised you and supported you and
and I am thankful but you know anytime I
question being adopted who my biological
parents are that's like a twinge of
guilt sort of that sounds like a lot of
pressure to sort of have to feel
especially initially I'm sure you end up
dealing with it and everyone deals with
it in their own way over time yeah and
my own personal temperament probably
plays into it like I as you know I'm a
psychiatrist and I sort of am really in
touch or tried to be with not only my
own emotions about other people's like
that's sort of what I do is my
livelihood is help people who are
dealing with a lot of psychological
stress and pathology and and so I'm sort
of sensitive to those sort of feelings
of guilt and stress and sure well you
mentioned that this is sort of a
disadvantage you sort of discover it and
there's sort of this this guilt that you
have to deal with but um can you speak
more about some of the other are there
any advantages to being adopted and you
know is there is there anything good
that comes from sort of being in that
scenario did you find were you fortunate
fortunate in any way or did you feel
lucky in some sense I did you know
probably i don't know if it's obvious or
not but being adopted you obviously were
chosen by two individuals i guess it
could be one who want to raise you and
you know who actively want to be you to
be a part of their lives and who want to
know surround you with their love and
their support and their caring whereas
not that biological parents don't have
that same feeling but sometimes you know
biological children just sort of happen
I would imagine and there's not this
rigorous active progress process not
that you know there's an active rigorous
process and adopting an individual and
you know in the fact that I was chosen
and there's several other people who
aren't you know makes me thankful that
that I was the obvious advantage of
being able to be in a supportive loving
home sure how did that make you think
about your biological parents once you
discover this information what was going
through your mind about you know the
scenario in which you found yourself did
you have questions yeah I mean I think
there's a lot of fantasy that goes on
with you know who they could be like are
they like me do they act like to me do
they talk like me where their
professions like what if it's like you
know I remember when I was a teenager
like what if it's like some European
like royal family who like ships their
child off to North Carolina and was
reared by you know some really awesome
southern parents that obviously came to
mind also like what if they're in jail
or you know you know not even live like
you know that that came into mind so I
was just always curious as to what they
were what they were like and also what
was the situation that led them to
having to put up a child for adoption
okay um so what kind of questions you
have now as an adult how interested are
you and you know the the idea that
you're adopted and you know you have
biological thing
you may or may not know or think that
they are alive or anywhere close by but
what kind of questions you have about
those ideas now about my biological
parents yeah I still wonder like what
were the circumstances that led them to
you know you know making the decision to
put me up for adoption I'm also just
sort of curious about their lives like
what are they like if I have any
siblings or not and that's always a
question of mine if there are any health
considerations you know there's a lot of
health's diseases medical diseases that
have a huge genetic component and like
knowing that information is important to
me and just sort of what their outlook
on life is now that they have an
individual that's being raised by other
people like did they ever think about me
did they ever wonder how I'm doing or
what I'm not too sure what do you know
about your actual adoption story do you
have any information about what actually
did happen so um after I found out I was
adopted I sort of dropped dropped it for
a while because I had this incredible
sense of guilt that I should be thankful
and I should be happy with what I have
and that I shouldn't you know pursue
things that may hurt my parents feelings
so I sort of left it alone into all went
to college and while i was in college I
thought well I should you know try to
find out some information because it
might be interesting to know sort of
what information is out there knowing
that that's probably limited so I
contacted the Department of Social
Services of Wayne County and it took
like a month or two for me to get these
paper documents that basically said the
file is closed which means that the of
all biological parents did not want to
have any communication with me after
putting me up for adoption they wanted
to sort of be a closed file but they did
have some generic health information
that entered in nothing about my
biological father my biological mother
was
19 she was in Community College she
really liked art she likes swimming she
was like 54 had all burn hair and it
said that my her great aunt had breast
cancer i believe and someone in the
family had diabetes and how did it make
you feel to find that even that little
bit of information it it you know it
just made me more curious because i know
that there's so much more of a so many
more facets of their store in their
livelihood and there's just few answers
than the hair color and height sure and
it made me more curious about what they
were like did you feel a connection to
any of the traits you discovered about
your biological mom uh well i have
auburn hair and that's sort of the
closest thing i guess i'm in the arts um
what I like music but that's really it
the document was sort of sterile and
information it presented so I didn't
find that much of a connection sure have
you ever thought about trying to find a
bigger connection I have you know the
other avenues that I could pursue to
find out who my biological parents are
right now all I've known about was
pursuing adoption detective agencies I'm
not really sure what the formal name of
the more but they're quite expensive and
I just haven't ever had the but the time
of the financial resources to pursue
that but I'm sort of open to going
through that Avenue later on in life
sure and of course I know because you're
a new medical doctor I'm your
psychiatrist you are familiar with what
you know modern technology can do as far
as DNA results and
you know as part of participation we've
offered you an opportunity to actually
submit a DNA sample and find out you
know if they're in the 23andme program
if you might find any genetic relatives
of yours you know what are your thoughts
surrounding that you've you've submitted
your DNA you submitted your sample but
you haven't seen your results yet you
know what are some thoughts going into
that about participating in the program
like that and what you expect to see
what you expect to find and how that
might make you feel you know to be
honest I thought about it too much
because again that fantasy play of you
know finding my biological parents like
finding the DNA that may match with mine
and seeing what percentage the
similarities are and being able to
contact them I don't want to disappoint
myself because I know that the the
highest likelihood is that there's
probably going to be some distant
distant cousin that has similar DNA to
me so I'm not really putting a whole lot
of stock until as far as finding
somebody but I am interested in seeing
you know the other facets of my DNA that
23andme will sort of alyssa days such as
risk for medical diseases and
pharmacological sort of ability to
metabolize drugs and respond to them
think that's a part of it and just
generic ancestry stuff that's mainly
what I'm looking forward to sync but
again like he thinks possible so if
something were to come up it would shock
me and I'm sure I would have a variety
of emotions but I haven't really thought
about it too much i am going to like go
through and sort of see what all
informations they are not going to sort
of block it because if it's there it's
there and i want to know about it but do
you think in your current state of mind
if you were to find let's say you know
let's just say a cousin or more you know
third second cousin or someone even more
related do you think you are interested
in possibly making a connection with
that person and maybe
reaching out to explore more and maybe
even meet them that's a tough one I am
Not sure I don't know what all I would
gain from contacting someone that's
anymore further out than grandparents
are first cousins just because you know
I'm worried that it would open doors too
I'm actually not sure I haven't really
thought about it that of trying to
contact those people I think if it were
like my biological parents or siblings
or grandparents I would but I don't know
because they may not know because it was
sort of open a doorway to possibly some
drama where I say hey I'm an adopted
individual and I'm your second cousin
and then they try to like contact all
their relatives to figure out who and
their families put someone up for
adoption and that person may not want
their whole family to know that they had
a kid and had to put them up for
adoption I don't know if I want to
expose unknown individual so that kind
of sordid drama I'm sure what do you
know anything about any blood relatives
at all do you have other two besides
your mom there there's no knowledge you
don't know of anyone else that you're
genetically related to currently I don't
know of anything substantial there's
always been speculation in the community
that this person in a far off part of
North Carolina may be related to because
they look similar to me or at similar to
me but nothing substantial as far as
blood relatives it would be interesting
if there were North Carolina but i'm not
sure and sort of just sort of wrap up
pretty soon here let's say you
participate in 23 me and you do find
something and it's closer you may find a
relative it's closer than second cousin
you may have whatever feelings you have
about it what are your thoughts around
your adoptive family or as you call them
your real
parents what do you think how do you
think they feel about this are you
connecting or or just what are your
feelings surrounding them I feel a
little bit better about it when since
sub since the first time that I've found
out I was adopted to this current point
in time we've talked about it here and
there and they've sort of openly
admitted that there would be fine with
me going out trying to find my
biological parents and they said that if
they were in my position that would want
to know you know if there was someone
that was biologically related to them
they said that curiosity is something
that they don't think they could sort of
push push aside and they don't feel you
know at all like they're less
appreciated for what they've done for me
or feel like I love them any less which
I don't because I did raise me so but
you know there's always going to be a
tinge of that sort of survivor guilt or
whatever that I'm always going to have
but I don't think it will impede me from
trying to contact or pursue some sort of
connection if there is one are you
excited to see your 23andme results I am
I am I've been holding out they've
actually been available for a little bit
now but for the purposes of the
interview I've sort of held back I'm
waiting on the edge of my seat to see
what they say well I hope that they're
good results no matter what that may be
and we'll see what kinds of you know
feelings and emotions and where you are
will give you a chance to look at those
results and see what they are and i'll
let you come back hopefully and talk to
us a bit about what you found out and
very least you know we'll talk a little
bit about deep ancestry and lineages
some of the health risk but also
hopefully maybe even some relative
connections we'll see we'll say i'll
stay hopeful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
