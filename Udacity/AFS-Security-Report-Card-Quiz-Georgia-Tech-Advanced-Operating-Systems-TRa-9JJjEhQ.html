card which says how well is AFS doing as
a secure system and I want you to think
about some of the challenges that a
secure system has to face the first one
is mutual suspicion meaning can I trust
the server can the server trust that
line can I trust my fellow users in the
community is that challenge address by
AFS I want you to give a binder the
answer yes or no the second attribute I
want you to evaluate the Andrew file
system on is whether the users are
protected from the system or in other
words can the system do something bad to
the users so that's the second attribute
I want you to evaluate once again a
binary answer yes or no the third
attribute is confinement of resource
usage in other words does the system
ensure that no particular user can over
use resources available in the system
the resources could be network bandwidth
and so on again binary answer the fourth
thing that I want you to evaluate the
AFS system is on authentication whether
it provides authentication in both ways
both authenticating the server to the
client and the client to the server the
last attribute is the integrity of the
server itself meaning can the server be
compromised in any fashion that's the
last attribute I want you to evaluate
once again binary answer yes or no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
