difficult to pin down it's really
exploration of unstructured and
naturalistic data for example if you're
trying to develop a tool that will
improve learning you might interview
some students that you hope will use
your tool to understand what they
struggle with and what they like or you
might choose to observe a classroom just
in its natural environment taking notes
on the various dynamics that you see
apply the downside of qualitative
research is that it's often not as
generalizable it might be transferable
to new environments but it doesn't
generalize out to some objective truths
the way we can sometimes get with
quantitative data but with education we
often have to use qualitative research
because there are so many things going
on in the classroom so many things going
on in the learning process that boiling
it down to a couple clean numbers just
loses the real magic of what's going on
so qualitative research is something we
use very often educational research
because it helps us capture the real
range of all the different interacting
parts of the learning process so here
we'll talk about the different kinds of
qualitative research will talk about
case studies and interviews I'll talk
about how to do them and how to make
sure that the conclusions that you get
out of these kinds of research are still
valid and sound and useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
