program manager for the Georgia Tech
team here at Udacity he also formerly
worked at the education startup Edmodo
thank you so much for talking to us
today yeah absolutely David so I'm the
first thing I'd ask is that many of our
students in this class might be
interested in spinning up their projects
to start up after this class is done
okay I'm one of some obstacles or some
things to keep in mind when dealing with
the business side of educational
technology I mean one you would really
want to go in and exhibit a lot of
patience it is really slow working with
universities in any educational
institution there are a lot of things
that they need to consider that you may
not necessarily be considering at the
time you're beginning your startup I'm a
federal law state laws and they have to
look out for students rights and privacy
and all that comes into play anytime you
want to work or do anything on a
national institution so what about
EdTech when it's not necessarily dealing
with them academia though so for example
here at Udacity we do education but we
don't do it partnering with a university
except for Georgia Tech we do other
programs so are there any specific
considerations when doing it outside of
that overlap I mean one you really want
to focus on you know what it is that
you're trying to get across or teach you
to the students you know while we're at
moto you know our primary concern was
communication we wanted to make sure
that the communication flowed between
the teacher and the students and amongst
the students themselves here at Udacity
we're focused a little bit more on the
pedagogy of actually teaching a
particular subject so we want to make
sure that you know what we're teaching
and how we're teaching it is
particularly sound so for those students
who might be interested in spending
their project I've been to some kind of
business or a startup what would you say
the first step is what do they need to
do the two or three weeks after this
semester is over to move that along I
mean really start small you know and be
patient you share with your classmates
and you know other people at the
educational institutions or you know
just friends and I present the idea to
them and you try to get a little bit of
feedback of what they think is going to
be you know viable and then putting
together a Minimum Viable Product is
really important you don't want to go
too far and you know try to build
something that's going to get a lot of
users right away it's going to take time
you know Edmodo we're a grassroots
organization where teachers talk to
teachers about our
but it took time to build up the number
of users and you know after a while the
network effect you know worked such that
we were able to get you know millions
and millions of students and teachers on
the platform but it took a long time and
a lot of patience yeah make sense also
for those students who might want to go
into the business side of educational
technology dippity final suggestions for
them before we sign off again patients
it you know if you're going to work with
any kind of educational institution you
know they have a you know they have
their process and you know what we've
discovered or I discovered here at
Udacity working with Georgia Tech is the
business world moves at the speed of
light and unfortunately the academic
world doesn't and for good cause you
know they need to be careful and they
you know they're trying to protect their
students to try to project their
institution they have state laws federal
laws and you know all that stuff and
working through that stuff it takes time
and you the more you can communicate and
be open with what you intend to do and
share with MIT as many people as
possible the better luck you're going to
have i can say i participated kind of
peripheral e in the NSF I core process
it looks to develop academic research up
into businesses and that's one of things
they really really emphasize as well as
customer discovery go out and talk to
your customers that the number one thing
or one of them are one things that trips
up early startups is they assume they
know their customer and they assume they
know exactly what they want they never
talk to them because we know what you
want and they just sign their tool for
them and then hit market and find out
design something that no one wants
absolutely so really talking to the
people who might want to use the tool
throughout would be I think I agree the
first Abdul absolutely and getting their
perspective is really important you know
we you know come in and we want to
disrupt everything we want to disrupt
education we think we have a really good
idea and doing so and we have you know
the best intentions but oftentimes their
perspective you know wall sometimes even
archaic is still a pretty valuable and
you want to make sure you take that into
account because these are the people
you're going to be working with yes we
all want to serve the students and make
you know the world a better place but we
do need to do it in a measured fashion
yeah sounds good okay well thank you so
much for talking to ya anytime David</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
