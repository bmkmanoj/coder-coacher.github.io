to figure this out how would we go about
trying to figure this out yeah what do
you think which one would you choose and
how would you choose it ah so oh that's
a good question well just given what you
what you've given me I'm gonna guess I
think smartly guess that probably K
equals three is the right one and K
equals three and I'll tell you why it's
because zero one and two seem to make
quite a few errors three does a pretty
good job but doesn't doesn't over commit
to the data and that's the problem with
eight is that eight says you know the
training data that I have is exactly
right and I should bend and move heaven
and earth in order to match the data and
that's probably the wrong thing
certainly if there's any noise or or
anything else going on in the data right
so it sort of seems like it's overkill
especially that it's doing these crazy
things between the points where is the
cubic one even though it clings pretty
close to the points it stays between the
points kind of between the points which
seems like a really smart thing so yeah
so so that turns out to be the right
answer but let's actually let's actually
evaluate that more concretely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
