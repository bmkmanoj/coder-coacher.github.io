that Ellis was using the running time of
an algorithm can often vary dramatically
vary with the size of the input that the
algorithm is given but the running time
can also change with the content or the
structure of the input and here's a
simple example to show you this so the
algorithm takes as input a string s 0 to
s n minus 1 which means it's a string of
length n so n characters in the string
and here's the algorithm so the
algorithm does something very simple
given that string it counts the number
of times that the character a appears in
that string so it sets the counter to 0
then goes through all the characters in
the string one by one and if that
character is equal to a then it will
increase the counter so as in the
previous examples we're going to take
this line here as a simple operation
meaning it takes one time step each time
it's executed and we're also going to
consider this one here a simple
operation meaning also this whole line
here is going to take one time step each
time it's executed now what I would like
you to do as our next quiz is tell me
the number of time steps this algorithm
takes for a given string s and to give
me that answer there's two things you
need to know or two variables you'll
have to take into account one is in the
length of the string and the other one
as you're going to find out is a and
with a we're just going to denote the
number of times that the character a
actually appears in that string so your
answer is going to be some formula that
includes n and includes a and I would
like you to give me the running time by
entering the coefficients in the
following formula so it's gonna be some
number multiplied by n plus some number
multiplied by a plus a constant so
please enter those three numbers so that
the resulting formula is the running
time of this algorithm when it
encounters a string of length n where
the led
a occurs exactly a times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
