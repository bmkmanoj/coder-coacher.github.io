closures we've seen many in other
people's code but now we're finally
ready to write our own writing a method
that takes a closer as a parameter has a
wacky syntax but don't worry we have a
great tool called gosh-darn closure
syntax com let's take a look at it this
is gosh-darn closure syntax calm and
it's a list of all the different ways
that you can declare a closure in Swift
so you have it as a variable optional
variable type alias etc the one we're
actually interested in is argument to a
function call so we want a function that
takes a closure as one of its parameters
or arguments there is another version of
this site with a far more memorable name
but our lawyers told me I couldn't use
it finding it is left as an exercise to
the interested student anyway let's get
back to Xcode now we're going to write a
method called with big image that takes
a completion handler as a parameter what
will this method do it's going to
download the image in the background and
once it's finished once it's done it
will run the completion handler the
completion function the closure or
handler however you want to call it is
what it should do with this image once
it has it so let's get started this is
the signature for the with big image
method it takes one parameter and this
parameter has two different names an
internal name called handle and an
external one called completion handler
but the important stuff is here it
returns nothing but it takes one
parameter a uiimage that's because since
it's going to do something with a
uiimage it must have access to that UI
image that this method is going to
provide so the completion handler must
take as a parameter the image that has
been downloaded
next we will have to fill in the code
and it's going to be very similar to
what we wrote previously I'm going to
need to create a download queue and then
we're going to add to that Q a closure
that downloads the queue in the
background and then we will finally once
we're done we're going to run this
handler and you can start thinking right
now in which q do you think that the
completion handler should run let me
write the code and we'll get there so
the first step is to call dispatch async
and we need also a queue but this time
we're not going to create a cue from
scratch we're going to reuse one of
those for cues that the system allocates
for each application on iOS and we need
to choose also the priority of this
queue it depends if it's something very
urgent something that has been initiated
by the user and it should get a decent
priority if it's something that can wait
then you could give it a lower priority
but first we need to get this cube the
first parameter for dispatch get global
Q is something called the identifier
that's actually a constant that gives
you the priority of the queue this qos
by the way means quality of service
class background that means pretty bad
quality of service it's going to have a
low priority and user interactive is the
top priority and user initiated is a
normal priority I'll set that and the
flags those are not being used right now
that has been set up for the future so
right now you should pass 0 and we have
the closure so within this code that's
where we have to get the URL download
the NS data turn it into a UI image and
then once we have the image run the
completion handler let's write this
should be familiar by now but let's
write it
so here's the code that we've been
writing over and over and over it's
encapsulated in a nice if flat statement
so nothing evil will happen if we get an
ill the only thing that is left is to
run the completion closure and that's
just like calling any kind of closure or
a function so it would be handler image
and the image that we download it now
look carefully at this code and think if
this is wise if this is a good idea
everything that is running inside this
closure is running in the background q
however completion handlers or
completion enclosures are usually used
to update the UI so they will very
likely use an access UI kit so this is
definitely not a good idea it might
crash if whatever code is in that
handler that we don't know exactly
what's in there because we get it as a
parameter as a black box if that
accesses uiq this code will crash
definitely so it's a good practice to
make sure that always all your
completion handlers run in the main
queue this is not a rule but it's a very
good practice make sure that always all
your completion handlers those that you
write run in the main queue when we get
a library from a third party and it has
completion handlers you should check the
documentation to make sure where those
completion handlers are running the
usual is the main queue so we need to
wrap this code here in a dispatch async
dispatch get main queue and then call
the completion handler this should be
trivial by now let's finish it here it
is we call dispatch async as usual then
dispatch get main queue because we want
to run the next closure within the the
main queue and inside this closure will
run the complete
handler so this way we're also hopping
from one cue to the other we hop to a
background queue here then when we have
the image we go to the main queue and
run the completion handler and either if
this completion handler uses you I kid
or not it's okay the code will not crash
and now we're finally done no hang on
there this is a very good moment for you
to go and take a look at the black box
code that hides the reality of GCD for
most students it should be obvious to
you right now just by staring at the
code you should be able to see the lady
in the red dress and there's extra nerdy
points for you if you know what I'm
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
