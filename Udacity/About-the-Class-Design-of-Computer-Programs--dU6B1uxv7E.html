you're going to be learning by example
so I'll pose some problems to you and
you'll get a chance to create your
solution and then I'll show you and
discuss my solution it's important to
note that there's more than one way to
approach a problem and I don't mean that
my solution is the only way or the best
way my solutions are there to help you
learn a style and some techniques for
programming but if you solve problems a
different way that's fine good for you
all learning that goes on happens inside
of your head not inside of my head so
what's important is that you understand
the relation between your code and my
code that you get the right answer by
writing out the solution yourself and
then you can examine my code and maybe
pick up some pointers and some
techniques that you can use later for
example suppose I asked you to compute
the sum of a list of numbers here's the
mathematical formula and I asked you to
write a function which we'll call SS for
sum of squares which takes a list of
numbers as input if you've taken CS 101
you might write a solution like this
will initialize the total to be 0 we'll
go through the indices of the numbers
and for each one we'll increment the
total by the square of the number and
then when we're done we'll return the
total so that's a perfectly good
solution no problems with that
whatsoever
if you're able to come up with that
you've done your job but then after you
come up with your solution I'll show you
mine and mine might look like this same
function definition but I might prefer a
functional style rather than a
sequential style where I'm saying return
the sum of the squares of X for each X
in numbers now maybe you've never seen
something like this before maybe you
didn't know about the sum function maybe
you didn't know about the
type of generator expression in line so
this might all be new to you the
important point is that this solution of
yours is just as valid as mine so what I
want you to do is just compare your
solution to my solution and see if
there's anything interesting or new in
mine that you might pick up I don't want
you to say hey that's not fair Peter you
introduced some new idea that I haven't
seen before
don't let that make you upset instead I
want you to say how my solution works
but this is interesting too and here's
something new I want you to be happy
that you learn something new and proud
that you came up with a solution that
was just as good but happened to just
use some different techniques so
remember learning is not me saying
something and pouring that into your
head rather learning is what goes on
inside of your head and it's up to you
to make use of what I show you so that
you can learn this class is an
apprenticeship you learn first by
observing then by trying it yourself
when the next example comes up and then
finally you'll know you really got it
down when you can take what you've
learned and teach it to someone else
maybe in the forums or maybe outside of
class now one final point the problems
in this class are hard the best learning
takes place when you're challenged and
this class will challenge you don't
worry if you don't get everything on the
first try use the forums to ask
questions view the videos more than once
if you think that helped give yourself
time to let new ideas sink in you may
have to see them multiple times before
it makes sense so don't worry about
having to review multiple times or ask
for help it's hard but it's fun hard so
welcome to the class good luck I hope
you enjoy it as much as I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
