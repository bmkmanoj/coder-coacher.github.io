some channels that make it easier to
separate these things well we already
saw this from our previous conversation
let's separate out the intensity from
the color okay so the first thing we're
going to do is we're going to find
intensity why is some combination of our
G and B okay and so that gives you this
nice picture here and those of you that
are old enough to remember black and
white television you start to be
thinking oh wait a minute this is like
an image that just reflects the overall
intensity of what's there and that would
be correct all right and in fact a
luminance function which is what this
called is just a linear weight of the
red green and blue pixels here are
weights of red green and blue and by
combining them together i get a single
value y for luminance remember why
stands for luminance for reasons that
are because it's the middle of XYZ
that's why all right so now I need the
two other values right I mean I could
just keep the RG and then try to
reconstruct them but instead what they
do is they compute a different color
space then this is called the y UV color
space and here's a computation that
takes the B values the Y values and
creates a new value called U and V in a
way of thinking about this is one of
them has to do is sort of the difference
between the luminance and blue and the
other one is the difference between
luminance and red and it matches and it
creates this thing called UV and the
thing that unique that you need to know
is that u and V contain the color
information so if they tell you that
they're giving you an image in y UV
space you know that UV contained the the
chromatic the color information and by
the way in this y UV mapping there's a
maximum and minimum that u and v can get
mapped to and that's why it's called you
max V Max and we assume that RGB range
from 0 to 1 okay if it goes from 0 to
255 you just scale the whole thing all
right when you create that you can
actually make three images right you can
make a why image au image and a V image
and that would look like this alright so
the Y image is exactly what you're used
to
being in your black-and-white television
but you're you image in your v image
those contain the color elements now you
might ask well why aren't they in color
why aren't they in color because each
one of them is a single channel okay
right so that's the you so the brighter
it is the higher you the lower it is the
less you same thing with v</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
