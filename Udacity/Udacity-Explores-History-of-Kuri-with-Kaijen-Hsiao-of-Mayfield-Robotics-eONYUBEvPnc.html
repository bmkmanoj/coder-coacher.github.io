of Mayfield robotics well when I was an
undergrad I was majoring in mechanical
engineering and I watched all these
great videos from MIT of the robots that
were being built there and in particular
the ones that I was very interested in
where cynthy Brazil had kismet one of
the first social robots and I found that
very compelling and also the MIT leg lab
had a lot of hopping robots that I
thought were really cool and all told I
looked at those and I thought wow I I
could make awesome robot kept Sunday and
that would be really cool actually
originally I wanted Pitt when I was
growing up I had lots of small animals
so hamsters and gerbils and such and I
always wanted the dog and I asked my dad
for a dog and he promised me at some
point that I could get a dog and then he
was like no I didn't actually promise
that and I was annoyed for a long time
that I could not have a dog and you know
in college of course I could not have
pets either and so I was like oh well if
I had a robot head that would be okay so
if I made robot pets and those of us who
can't have actual pets could have pet
still so as an undergrad I went
Princeton and I majored in mechanical
engineering and I started doing robotics
there and then for grad school I went to
MIT and I decided that I want to focus
more on robot brains making robots do
cool things rather than making robot
bodies and so I switched to computer
science and I focused on robotics in
particular grasping and regulation and
probablistic clanging so making robot
arms pick up things even under
uncertainty and after grad school I
graduated and went to a company called
Willow Garage which at the time was when
great hotbeds of robotics and developing
the robot operating system and I was
working with PR twos these big humanoid
like robots with two arms driver on
house do research into grasping
manipulation in the home and tell it
operation that's our thing and after a
will rush shut down I went to Bosch to
join my friend Sarah awesomesauce key
and both of us were researchers at the
research and Technology Center in Palo
Alto where we did research into all
sorts of different robots farming robots
home robots etc and there we proposed
the Bosch that we should make a company
a whole company to do home robotics and
they accepted a proposal and so we
started Mayfield robotics in geni
2015 and here we are today so when we
were at Bosch there was a whole need
finding effort to figure out what people
wanted robots do at home the big
question was what is in between a robot
vacuum cleaner and something like Rosie
the robot from the Jetsons which well we
all want to get there someday
we're technologically not quite ready to
be there and so what's in between two
that we can bring into people's home us
to raise acceptance of robots in the
home and to give people something to get
used to as this robots are normal to
have in the home and so what we came up
with originally was the concept of a
home security robot and so when we
started Mayfield actually the the main
concept was around home security and we
we knew we wanted the robot to be
adorable and personable just so that we
could get the robot in the home but the
focus was still initially on home
security and over time talking to users
we converted that from security focused
to entirely companionship and
entertainment focused and security being
only kind of a sideline a thing that you
can do but it's not the main focus of
the robot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
