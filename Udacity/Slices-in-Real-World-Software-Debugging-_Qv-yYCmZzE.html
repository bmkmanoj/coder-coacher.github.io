excluded only two lines out of the
program namely these two lines this may
not sound much like it in terms of
reduction in larger program however a
dynamic slice can reduce the number of
statements to look at considerably first
and they contain only executed lines
that is lines that aren't executed don't
become part of the dynamics lies in the
first place and of course a line that's
never executed can't have anything to do
with the bug it may have something to do
with a fix though second they only
contain statements that actually
influence the output if your output
contains several independent parts then
a dynamic slice of just that part will
be much much smaller than the entire
program in 2010 we did a study on seven
bugs in Java programs and measured how
big their dynamic slices would be to
start with on average only 7 dot three
percent of the lines were actually
executed which means that a simple
coverage tool which tells you which
statements are executed and which ones
are not will already focus the search to
a small very small part of the program
when looking at the dynamic slice the
reduction in size becomes even more
apparent because again on average the
dynamics lies encompassed only two dot
eight percent of the lines in the
program and since there's nice tools
available which compute dynamic slices
automatically using such a tool in the
first place will immediately tell you
which places of the program you can
safely ignore because they are not
executed or because they cannot possibly
have influenced the output with respect
to the bug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
