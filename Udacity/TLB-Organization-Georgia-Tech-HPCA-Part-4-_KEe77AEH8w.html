let's talk about how it is organized in
terms of cash properties first is it
direct map or fully associative or
somewhere in between well it is small so
it is already very fast so it tends to
be fully or highly associative usually
we don't have direct map tlbs
because that would sacrifice the hit
rate for speed but because it's so small
it's already very fast so we don't
really need that how about the TLB size
we want it to hit at least as often as
our cache so we wanted to cover more
memory than the cache so we usually
wanted Tilby to be somewhere about 64 to
512 entries what if we need more TLB
entries in order to get the hit rate
that we want well you don't want it to
be too large because then it's gonna
become slow in that case you want to
have a two-level TLB the first level or
at level one TLB will be the small and
fast one that hits in a single cycle but
if you have a Miss there we have a
larger level two TLB it has a hit time
that is several cycles so it's
significantly slower than l1
but still way faster than going through
memory and doing the translation and it
is large it can be several thousand
entries because with several thousand
entries we can still support relatively
good hit times but not a single cycle
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
