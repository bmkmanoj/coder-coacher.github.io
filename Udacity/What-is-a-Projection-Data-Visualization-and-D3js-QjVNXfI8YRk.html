theoretically have to do anything much
different from when we displayed points
in a scatterplot we simply need to
convert from some data representation to
a screen representation or rather go
from the domain of our data to some
range of pixels to draw in the web page
in this scatter plot we went from years
representing as a date and attendance
represent as floats to pixel values or
rather x coordinate and y coordinate on
our chart and for our map we do exactly
the same thing except this time we're
going from geographic coordinates to an
Associated pixel range or more
specifically we're going from a latitude
and a longitude coordinate to pixel
values the latitude actually corresponds
to the y-coordinate and the longitude
corresponds to the x coordinate in the
scatter plot we used d3 scale to go from
our data domain to our pixel range and
in a very analogous way to convert our
geographic coordinates to a pixel range
we have to use a projection or more
specifically in our case we'll be using
the Mercator projection but let's take a
second now and really understand what a
projection is coordinate data that
represents points on a sphere or our
case the globe actually encodes
information in three dimensions and
since the earth being a
three-dimensional object or a sphere
there is no perfect way to display it on
a two-dimensional surface such as a
computer screen or a piece of paper one
approach that you could take and is
often used out there is to simply render
a globe or a three-dimensional object in
a web page using three-dimensional
graphics but this has its own set of
complexities in addition to the fact
that you can usually only see one face
of the globe at a time the other much
more common approach is to use a
projection which actually has been done
for centuries to draw maps on parchment
or canvas
the act of projection can be thought of
as cutting the surface off of a
three-dimensional object or globe and
trying to flatten it out into two
dimensions and there's never a perfect
way to represent something in greater
dimensions in a lower dimension without
some loss of information or distortion
so when you're going from a
three-dimensional globe to a
two-dimensional map the question then
becomes where do we distort our map and
what's often done depends on the region
of Geographic interest if you're only
looking at countries on the equator you
want to try to best preserve the spatial
representation around the equator and
you might be willing to distort near the
poles and the Mercator projection does
just that
it decides to distort the least
populated regions more simply regions
near the poles to imagine this
projection think of trying to flatten
this globe out and in order to get a
square you stretch the areas near the
poles so that the Earth can be
represented by a rectangle which also
has the effect of straightening out the
latitude and longitude lines so the
Mercator projection sacrifices the poles
to preserve countries and areas closer
to the equator which have a much more
accurate representation in two
dimensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
