surprise you it's not the variant with
the three letters that are deleted with
the one with the single letter deletion
and the reason is incredibly interesting
because the codon reading frame shifted
think about it for a second in this
first scenario here you're the ribosome
you're reading the sequence right so
you'd read the code on gtc CTC GT oh my
gosh what do we do we're missing one
what's going to happen is it's going to
read the very next letter and that's
going to be associated with the codon
GTG well notice GTG is the exact same as
what it was before and now we go to ACC
and what essentially happened is we went
GTG ACC we skipped over this whole GTG
to this acc and everything from here on
out is pretty much the same thing so
it's bad right we lost three letters but
in the end we only lost one whole amino
acid where's down here if we're the
ribosome we get the first coat on the
second coat on and then we get here we
skipped one we got to a G what we're
still the same GTG but now we're going
to keep moving to the next three and we
get TGA si si si si ttg and you'll
notice that these codons are not the
same as these codons up here they're
very different and on top of it this
code on here TGA what does that code for
it codes for big ol stop codon so this
mutation here we only deleted one letter
but it caused a frameshift and then we
introduce an early stop codon this is
going to drastically change the protein
sequence compared to this mutation or to
this deletion here even though the
deletion was three letters and this one
was only one letter this variation is
far more significant in the resulting
protein</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
