types of projects before you jump in and
write a fancy algorithm you'll want to
spend some time getting familiar with
your data the process begins with a
question you want to answer or a problem
you want to solve this might be
something like what are the
characteristics of students who pass
their projects or how can I better stock
my store with the products people most
want to buy the next step of the process
is data wrangling and this really has
two parts data acquisition and data
cleaning first you need to acquire the
data that you need to answer your
question or solve your problem then it's
time to begin investigating the data and
cleaning up any problems that you find
the third phase is data exploration
during this phase you spend some time
getting familiar with your data building
your intuition about it and finding
patterns once you're familiar with your
data you'll usually want to draw some
conclusions about it or maybe make some
predictions from one of our examples
previously Netflix's movie
recommendation system needs to predict
which movies its users will like also
the Facebook paper we saw concluded that
users are less likely to click certain
articles specifically once written from
a different ideological perspective than
the user has this phase usually involves
statistics or machine learning that are
beyond the scope of this course but
there are additional Udacity courses you
can take on these topics if you're
interested in learning more and finally
you'll need to communicate your findings
to other people your findings are only
as useful as your ability to communicate
them even if your end goal is to build
some sort of system like a movie
recommender or a newsfeed ranking
algorithm you'll usually need to share
what you fill and how it works with your
team there are a variety of formats this
communication can take you might write a
blog post a paper an email a PowerPoint
presentation or just have an in-person
conversation data visualization is a
common technique that's almost always
useful when communicating findings about
data now this process doesn't actually
follow a straight line especially the
data wrangling phase into the data
exploration phase are very intertwined
because you can't really
clean any problems with the data before
you take a look to see what problems
there are and even when you think you're
done wrangling and you're ready to just
explore you'll keep finding more
problems and have to go back throughout
the process you may need to return to
your question and refine it as you
become more familiar with the data set
and sometimes data acquisition actually
comes before you pose a question if a
new exciting data set is released you
might acquire the data first take a look
and see what's there and then think of
some questions you could answer with the
data that's what we'll be doing in this
lesson however this should give you an
idea of the high-level steps that are
involved when you're doing data analysis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
