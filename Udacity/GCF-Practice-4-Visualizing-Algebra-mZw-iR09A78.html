that the GCF is 9 q p squared and the
remaining factors are 3 Q P minus 2q
plus 5 p let's see how we got that
answer first I want to look at the
numbers 27 18 and 45 so I asked myself
what is the largest number that goes
evenly into 27 18 and 45 and with some
practice you'll notice that the largest
number that goes into those three
numbers is nine when we look at the
variables I need the variable to be in
each of the three terms and I want to
take the lowest exponent of each of the
variables so for the q's I have Q
squared q squared + q so the lowest
exponent is 1 for the PS i have P cubed
p squared + P cubed so the lowest power
of P is squared so the GCF as we said
was 9 q p squared when I'm trying to
figure out what are the remaining
factors I want to look at the first term
27 q squared P cubed and I want to ask
myself what do i need to multiply the
GCF by to get the first term first I
look at the coefficient i need to
multiply nine by three to get 27 i have
to multiply q by q to get Q squared and
i need to multiply P squared by P to get
P cubed so that's the first term for the
next term once again I ask myself what
do i need to multiply the GCF by to get
the second term i need to multiply 9 by
2 to get 18 i need to multiply q by q to
get Q squared and what do i need to
multiply P squared by to get P squared
nothing just one so our second term is 2
q or negative 2 q and then I put the
next sign which is plus what do i need
to multiply 9q p squared by to get the
third term well nine times five is 45 q
times one is Q P squared
times P gives me P cubed when factoring
one of the most important steps is to
find and factor out the GCF let's get
back to Chris so we can teach us more
about factoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
