but ultimately we want to talk about it
as a set of problems unfortunately this
isn't as easy as it might seem the
encoding rules we use for turning an
abstract problem into a string can
affect whether or not the language is in
P let's see how this might happen
consider the question does a graph G
have a Hamiltonian cycle that is a cycle
that visits all of the vertices exactly
once here's a graph and here is its
adjacency matrix a natural way to
represent the graph as a string is to
write out its adjacency matrix in
scanline order first to 0 then a 1 that
0 then a 1 then is 0 then a 1 then a 0
then a 1 then a 0 but this isn't the
only way to encode the graph we might do
something rather inefficient the
scanline encoding for this graph
represents the number 170 in binary we
could choose to represent the graph
essentially in unary we might represent
the graph as 342 zeros followed by 171
the fact that there are 2 to the 9th
equals 512 symbols total indicates that
it's a 3 by 3 adjacency matrix and
converting the 170 back into binary
gives us the entries of the adjacency
matrix this is a very silly encoding but
there's nothing invalid about it this
language it turns out is in P not
because it allows the algorithm to
exploit any extra information or
anything like that
but just because the input is so long
the more sensible concise encoding isn't
known to me in P and it probably isn't
by an overwhelming consensus of
complexity theorist thus a change in the
encoding can in fact whether a problem
is in P yet it's ultimately problems
that were interested in independent of
the particulars of the encoding we deal
with this problem essentially by
ignoring unreasonable representations
like this one as long as we consider any
reasonable encoding think about what XML
or JSON would produce from how you would
store it in computer memory then the
particulars won't change the membership
of a language in
P and hence we can talk at least
informally about problems being in P or
not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
