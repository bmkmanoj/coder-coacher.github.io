queries on our list of 25 links by hand
and that was a little tedious so what
are some of the downsides of querying
data by hand now I know we only had you
know 25 links there but one problem is
you know it's very error-prone you have
to write code for every for every query
you want to answer and if you don't get
the sort order right or something like
that you know you have trouble it's
tedious you know I could ask you a lot
of questions about you know get these
links sorted by this and that and link
submitted by this user and that user and
you know writing a function for each of
those can be a bit tedious and one of
the most important reasons is it's slow
now you didn't see that yet because we
only had 25 links and iterating over all
of those links sequentially wasn't a
problem there's only 25 links but if
there was a million links or a billion
links you wouldn't want to do that or
you wouldn't even be able to do that you
know I wouldn't even been able to build
that you know kind of fake database in
memory like I did there
so databases basically exists to take
you know big chunks of data like our
collection of links which could be in
the millions and answer queries on them
in a in a reasonable amount of time you
know without having to write a lot of
custom code which you know is always an
option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
