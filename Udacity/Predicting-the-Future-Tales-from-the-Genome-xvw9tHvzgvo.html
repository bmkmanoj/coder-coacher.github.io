code that would ever make you change
your mind or change reproductive
decisions for yourself in any way well
in the Jewish community teh sex is an
issue I don't know how many people are
aware of that and just really quick can
you tell us what tastes are gay sex is
in the same family as go Shay's disease
which is one of the diseases that I have
it's a lipid storage disease and intesa
x-babies the lipid accumulates in the
brain and the baby dies within a short
period of time and they under two years
old usually typically and there is no
treatment and it's pretty much
eradicated because either people don't
marry who are pre tested before I'm
talking about the Orthodox Jewish
community where people are tested before
marriage and they wouldn't have an
abortion so it prevents to people who
carry that mutation from getting married
and having a child who would die which
is interesting because in my community
we come into the Union knowing full well
what our options are and many still go
through with it this is interesting
because so Tay Sachs is a recessive
trait and achondroplasia is a dominant
trait which means it in the tay sachs
world having being a carrier means
you're not affected whereas in the case
of a contra pleasure if you're a carrier
it means you are affect your affected as
a carrier so I'm interested to hear
these sort of slightly different
perspectives here on the ability to sort
of think and plan well with it a sex
baby the baby is going to die I mean
that's that's the story today I don't
know if that will be the case in the
future I never knew that I was at a sex
care until now and I'm not
doing any more children and my husband
would have to be a carrier as well but
there are people in the Jewish community
who would test maybe at 11 weeks I don't
know what the right timing is to test
report any genetic diseases or any
situations and I guess it's a decision
at that time of what to do I think I'm I
just based on the information i already
have nothing would affect its kind of at
this point because of the results that I
have from 23 me nothing would really
impact my decision to have children it's
more of a my wife's works in biology and
it's really fun doing the punnett
squares between our possibilities of the
replicates are fun for her I think but
yeah I think and i can't speak for if
something were there I don't know what I
would do yes so it's kind of one of
those things that I think you have to
cross that bridge when you get there
when you get there and it's impossible
to predict what I might what how
different if things had been different I
don't know how I would have done
anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
