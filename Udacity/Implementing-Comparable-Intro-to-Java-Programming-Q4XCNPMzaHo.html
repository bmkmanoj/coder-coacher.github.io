sort them by writing one line of code if
I create an ArrayList of strings and add
a whole bunch of things not in any order
and then I want to print them out in
alphabetical order I can add the line
collections dot sort strings collections
is a class a little bit like a race that
has some useful utility methods if I
compile and run this code it'll print
out all of the animals that I added to
the list but from a to W we might want
to be able to sort countries like this
to let's say countries are naturally
ordered by their areas let's implement
the compareto method for countries and
want to be able to make an array of
countries like this and then use the
sort method in the arrays class to sort
all of the countries in the array so
that this will work let's implement the
comparable method for countries we'll
need to make the country measurable and
also comparable now the method should be
public and return an in it's called
compared to and it takes an object other
object now if we want to compare other
object to this object the first thing
we'll need to do is check whether other
object actually has a name and an area
if other object is not a country then it
doesn't really make sense to compare it
to this country if you keep studying
Java you'll figure out how to avoid this
caste using generics for now though
let's focus on the compareto method for
now fill in the code so that compared to
works as I described before for
countries
return a negative number if this country
is smaller than other positive if this
country is larger zero if the two
countries are equal and notice i
implemented dot equals for you so you
can use this and if the countries are
exactly the same size you can break ties
using the name
can you fill in the rest for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
