grammar for HTML and JavaScript and that
is no mean feat in fact a number of
years ago for my research I had to do
something similar but for perhaps an
evil or more production more popular
language Java we wanted to analyze Java
programs to look for particular errors
and there weren't really any convenient
parsers available at the time so I was
faced with the decision should i use a
tool that didn't really fit the bill or
should I try and write my own and I
thought boy Java's a real world
production language it's got to be
really hideous to write down a parser
for it I'm sure its grammar is really
hard to follow so I figured I'd give
myself a day to look at the official
Java grammar and try to write a parser
for it using the same sorts of
techniques we've covered in this class
imagine my surprise when it turns out
that the official Java language
specification actually uses the same
sort of format to the same sort of
context-free grammar that we've been
going over here in fact if you'll take a
look they're handling of if then else
statements or argument lists should look
very familiar to you it's more or less
exactly what we covered for JavaScript
and I ended up writing a parser for Java
1.1 at the time this was many years ago
that worked for our research I was able
to make a tool that fit me even though
there was none available using exactly
the sort of techniques that you have
just mastered through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
