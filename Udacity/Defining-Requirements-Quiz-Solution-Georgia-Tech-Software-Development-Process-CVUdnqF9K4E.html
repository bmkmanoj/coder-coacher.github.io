individually starting from the first one
and here this item has to do with how
the Machine stores the information and
how the corresponding algorithm is
written but it has no bearing in the
real world that is in the application
domain therefore this definitely belongs
to the machine domain and we're going to
put a 1 here what about a notification
of the arrival of a message on a small
watch this is an event that is generated
within the machine but that has an
effect an observable effect in this case
in the real world as well therefore
we're gonna mark this as 3 so this is an
event this is something that belongs to
the intersection between the application
domain and the machine domain so it's
something that could be in a
specification now what about an employee
that wants to organize a meeting with a
set of colleagues this is an event that
belongs to the application domain
because it is a fact that is true that
exists in the real world independently
from the existence of a machine
therefore we're gonna mark this as 2
finally the event of a user clicking on
a link on a web page is an event that of
course in the real world but that has an
effect also within the machine and
therefore we're gonna mark this as 3
something that happens at the
intersection between these two domains
and once more something that could be in
a specification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
