hadn't actually run any examples as
large but if you understood the examples
we saw with the smaller inputs you
should have been able to guess that it
would take about a second to do a lookup
for a table with 10 million keywords and
the reason for this if we look at the
previous executions we saw based on the
keywords in the index the time increased
linearly so when we had 10,000 keywords
we measure the time as 0.0009 seconds
when we had a hundred thousand we
measured the time as 0.009 seconds we
didn't measure any times beyond that the
suggestion from looking at this as well
when we increase the number of keywords
by ten the time also increased by a
factor of ten so maybe we could guess
that if we had a million keywords it
would probably take about 0.09 seconds
to do a lookup if we had 10 million the
time would take zero point nine seconds
which is close to one second if we had a
hundred million then the time would take
about nine seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
