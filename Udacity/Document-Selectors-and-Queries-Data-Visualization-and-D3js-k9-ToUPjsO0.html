in the JavaScript console if you type
document you can see what is returned is
the entire Dom document contained within
it is the HTML of the page and the HTML
tag the other top-level object available
is the window the window corresponds to
the browser window and the document
corresponds to the HTML page that's been
loaded one thing that you may want to do
when working with d3 is select elements
of a web page either by something like
their class their ID or even just what
type of tag they are but the way d3
actually does it selections is based on
the native Dom selection API that gets
exposed through native JavaScript if we
would say like to access a Dom node by
its ID we can call the appropriate
selector function on the document itself
if you notice here if I type document
get chrome is smart enough to
autocomplete what function I might want
but if there's multiple options it shows
me all of them as you can see here I can
get an element by its ID I can get
multiple elements by their class name in
yet multiple elements by their name I
can get multiple elements by their tag
name and so forth typically you never
need to access the Dom from this low
level of a function do the wealth of
libraries to make selecting elements
much more convenient one of the most
popular is jQuery and d3 has a very
similar method of selecting Dom nodes as
jQuery does but for now let's start with
the simplest and try to get an element
by its ID if we try to get the footer
this is gonna look for a Dom node that
has ID equal to footer and what we see
here is a div tag ID equal to footer and
we can expand this and see everything
that's contained within it the second
and last query function defined in the
Dom is what's called query selector
query selector is actually much more
general than get element by ID and is
what d3 uses internally query selector
allows us to use CSS selector syntax to
grab Dom elements if you're not familiar
with CSS queries
Elector syntax I recommend looking it up
as it's a very powerful syntax the
simplest and most commonly used CSS
query selector is probably the class
selector if you prepend a dot to
whatever class you're searching for the
document dot query selector will find
the dom nodes that have a class in this
case a viewer main as you can see here
viewer main corresponds to the main
window that the video players in and
this is actually the same object that
gets returned down here notice if I
hover over the Dom node in the console
or in the HTML frame up here chrome
smart enough to know that I'm trying to
inspect the Dom node in this case a div
with class viewer main and highlights it
for me in the left pane</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
