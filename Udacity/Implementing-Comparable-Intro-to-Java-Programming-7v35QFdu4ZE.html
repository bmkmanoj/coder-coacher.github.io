the two countries are exactly equal so
if this dot equals of their country then
I can immediately return zero otherwise
if this dot area is less than other
country area I want to return a negative
number I'll just go with minus one
otherwise if this dot area is less than
I mean greater than other country area I
want to return a positive number I think
one will do otherwise their areas must
be exactly equal in which case I'll use
this string compare to method on the
name and return the result of that once
they fix my syntax errors I want to
check that this actually works the way
I'd expect so I'm going to get out my
code pad and make some new countries El
Salvador should come before Belize so if
I compare El Salvador to Belize I should
get a negative number so far so good
certainly the opposite direction should
be positive and believes compared to
Belize should give me a zero and just to
make sure that I'm breaking ties let's
compare Belize to a made-up country with
the exact same area all right
negative 11 sounds good to me so long as
compared to doesn't return 0 with two
countries that are clearly different
countries now to make sure the work
wasn't all for nothing I want to show
you that now we can sort all of the
Central American countries using the
arrays dot sort method now if I run this
and I've tampered with the two string
method a little bit just to make this
easier to see I get the countries in
order by their areas sorting is actually
an interesting task one many people have
studied for years but we just managed to
do it in one line of code
hooray for interfaces</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
