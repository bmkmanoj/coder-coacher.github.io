professor in human biology in human
biology and anthropology at Stanford
University well we're really happy
you're joining us especially to talk
about a very important concept now we've
just been learning about lactose
intolerance and about the idea that as
all infants we have the ability as
mammals to digest these lactose
containing products and as we get older
our lactase expression diminishes but in
some people the lactase gene sort of
stays on and we continue to make lactase
and so I guess we'll start off by asking
why in human evolution would something
like this happen how could something
like this even happen well from a pan
mammalian background where the lactase
activity peaks around birth and then
tails off quickly into the weaning
period and into adulthood we assume we
know that that's Pamela million even
your house cat is lactose male absorb
mal absorber or lactose intolerant at
least every house cat that's been tested
is even though people will give milk to
their house cats and what we don't know
is whether the people have found the
threshold or the cats found the
threshold to avoid diarrhea and other
consequences what's interesting then is
from that background of a peak some
human population show persistent lactase
activity into adulthood while the
majority continue to decline so it's
that minority of lactose tolerant adults
that are really fascinating it's a
wonderful question because here's a case
where you have an interest specific
polymorphism you have the existence in
the ongoing persistence of a genetic
difference between human populations
with regard to some relatively simple
trait and a trait that has to be
relatively recent in human history there
were no sources of milk prior to dairy
animals so what we have here is I mean
other than Mother's Milk there were no
mammalian sources of milk for human
populations before agriculture and right
here is this right and I was going to
wonder too you know the idea that I mean
are we the only species that actually
drinks the milk from another species as
well I'm not aware of any species that
makes a habit of drinking the milk of
another species I'm aware of
infants of a particular an infinitely
particular mother nursing from another
mother that happens in pinnipeds it
happens in several mammals it's
considered milk stealing and obviously
there's great reward to the successful
pup but I'm not aware of another case
where especially where infants or adults
drink milk from another mammal that's
what that's a good question i really
don't i just don't know an answer to
that mm-hmm um so we have this scenario
than as you mentioned where we have this
sort of minority of people who instead
of having lactase expression diminish
over time it's persistent lactase that
Curtis and I to adulthood sure now you
mentioned that it seems to be relevant
specifically because of the recent
evolution of the straight because the
domestication of dairy uh-huh so we
assume that the Pema million background
means that at the dawn of history human
populations were all lactose intolerant
and that there would be at best a
mutational a low frequency of
individuals that varied on that
characteristic and because it was a very
low variation and there was no milk
available we would have no way of
knowing how much there was or how often
to record and so on but what we have
then in the meantime is this great
invention called agriculture the
domestication of plants and animals at
the service of the human food supply we
have every reason to believe that the
main animals that are used for milk
today were originally domesticated for
meat they were valued first for me and
that milk was as the expression goes
that were part of a secondary products
revolution where they realize that you
could use more than the meat from these
animals goats sheep you know cattle and
so on and so they already probably had
them in close association with human
communities they were probably already
harvesting the meet regularly they
probably had mastered overwintering
water supply hurting activities and that
sort of thing and then suddenly there's
evidence for using the milk product of
these animals some of the earliest
evidence comes from sahara
paintings that are dated to 4,500 BP
that show in fact bringing the calf up
near the female that I'll female and
human being underneath now we infer that
the human being underneath is doing this
what else is a human being doing under a
cow but that's some of the earliest
evidence and what's interesting is that
they bring the calf up to trigger the
letdown reflex in the in the cow so that
the humans can take the milk and to this
day farmers will tell you there's lots
of ways to induce that reflex but
women's bringing the calf up that makes
so much sense it's like a woman hearing
a baby cry a department stores like yeah
absolutely same thing and so it's clear
then or we surmise from this history
that milk was valued or the cattle were
valued first for beef or for their meat
product and then later for milk milk was
a secondary product it was a very
effective and the question then became
what was the advantage of milk on top of
the meat if you've already got an
addition to your food supply why is it
that milk suddenly is valuable that's
triggered the most debate and the most
interesting research I think the
question really is what was the added
value of drinking fresh milk it's
complicated on the one hand because you
had the meat value of these animals you
domesticated so it seems unlikely that
it would be just the protein or food
supply yet that was a important early
argument the question and and it's all
so complicated because there are ways to
get some food value from milk without
drinking it fresh you can all societies
that I know of have ways of processing
fresh milk into low lactose forms sour
milk is a low lactose form all the
things like yogurt and kefir drinks that
are widely known in some places and most
cheese's break down the lactose
externally using lactobacillus bacteria
using a separation of curds and whey
lactose is water soluble it drains off
with the way and the Kurds are free of
lactose so most cheese's have very low
lactose concentration
something like yogurt is full of
lactobacillus that's already digesting
the lactose for human consumption so
here's the real challenge in a world
where most populations sorry in a world
where most populations have ways to
process milk and to get everything
that's in the mill mm-hmm why would some
populations still evolve this persistent
lactase activity sure because their
external sources of lactase why does it
have what was the advantage of producing
it internally to the human organism and
that's the question that I focused on
early on because I thought that was just
so very fascinating on top of the food
value on top of whatever you can get
from yogurt and kefir and cheese and
sour milk why what's the advantage of
drinking fresh milk as an adult
especially when so many societies must
have regarded is repugnant because it
would cause diarrhea because it was
you're intolerant and you know that bait
is still running but the theory the
leading theory that I like is the and
that the data seem to support you know
in science knowledge is always tentative
so I want to want to put that out there
and be you know I will sound like I'm
convinced of this but you know I think
we're all maintaining a healthy
skepticism but that the leading argument
of the day is that calcium that the
advantage of drinking fresh milk is the
advantage of an additional calcium
supply especially in areas where there
is a calcium deficiency caused either by
inadequate calcium in the diet well
that's not too likely for being drinking
milk sure but a vitamin D scarcity
vitamin D is in turn photo synthesized
in the skin in response to sunlight so
that immediately suggested to me the
possibility that as you depart from low
latitudes of high ultraviolet light you
would encounter chronic built in
geospatial curves
of ultraviolet light deficiency and
therefore a vitamin which is what's
required for sure Maddie synthesis and
therefore vitamin D scarcity with
latitude now we learn actually in lesson
6 of our course we go and learn about
mutation and variation we use skin
pigmentation is not perfect and so this
is parallel so my hypothesis is that
this was completely parallel in fact in
coevolution the book that I've written
on this i have an appendix on epidermal
d melon ization it just show the
efficacy of the altitude no gradient in
ultraviolet light and vitamin d and in
calcium based selection for epidermal
demilitarization so i like that as a
background and i'm just saying look if
it's plausible there look at the
argument we can make here and then
people say well what's the advantage
milk is obviously rich in calcium but
what's the advantage of having what wipe
can't you again just eat the yogurt and
why can't you again just eat the milk
product the cheese which is going to
have the calcium in it except for the
water soluble calcium which you might
lose some of what's interesting with
some research on what's called the
lactose effect if you feed into human
infants from birth in a compared a
control comparison cow's milk from birth
or mothers milk versus soy milk you see
beginning at a matter of a few days you
see a big differential in the amount of
bone absorbed calcium in other words the
calcification of bone is enhanced you
can this is controlling for the amount
of calcium you take soy milk and you
supplement the calcium in it so that it
matches the cow's milk they have the
same calcium and the presence of the
lactose enhances the absorption of the
calcium according to this these data
that's a magnificent curve and at what
it shows is that the ability to drink
fresh milk has the advantage of making
the calcium that's there an equal
proportion in the two milks it makes it
more available to the infants who can
absorb who can digest the lactose
there's a mechanism suggested for this
it has to do with the trans
phosphorylation of of one of the opening
up of a calcium channel in in the
jejunal region the the brush brush
border membrane cells do jejunal region
of a small intestine and that it's the
removal of a blocking phosphate that
onto the splitting lactose molecule that
opens up the channel and that all the
presence and and breakage of the lactose
molecule opened the channel for the
entrance of the calcium so that lactose
is like vitamin D and so in just to be
clear it's not even maybe not per se the
lactose itself but the lactose the
action of lactose metabolism correct it
enhances the calcium up to correct now I
have to ask you so that's like wild
because that's like saying okay they
work differently vitamin D works by
in-house enhancing calcium binding
protein which actively absorbs it but
it's in both cases the action of the
vitamin D mechanisms at the brush border
cells of the jejunum of the small
intestine and so is the lactose effect
right there in the same epithelial
lining so it's pretty exciting actually
and it suggests then that one reason
that infants don't need a lot of sun
exposure at least to the best of my
knowledge is that they have the lactose
effect at the same time as they have and
that those people who have the gene for
persistent lactase activity continued to
enjoy the lactose effect in those years
all the way out for the persistent
lactase activity so what's particularly
interesting about that is it's saying
that lactase persistence compensates for
the vitamin D deficiency that's built in
to the solar radiation pattern on the
surface of our earth so that milk like
epidermal demonization they follow
similar curves and you get the
persistent lactase activity and lack
lactose tolerance at high latitudes
right and so just a sort of reword which
you say you're going to make sure you
know we're clear on this in the case for
a skin pigmentation you as you sort of
alluded to you
as human migration moved away from the
equator yeah to hire and I guess even I
guess we should also say lower latitudes
yes they had less sunlight and so we
have to say higher latitudes north and
south sure higher latitudes north and
south they lost pigmentation in the skin
because they needed to let more sunlight
in for vitamin D there was selection for
the entrance of more sunlight it wasn't
they recognized in yet yes exactly the
same with milk it wasn't where you're
sitting around here Wow hoping and
wishing we could have another source of
calcium what's happening is that those
that happened to have this mmmhmm out
reproduce bice you can even test whether
it's a three percent a two percent of
five percent how much does the
difference have to be in the long run in
terms of differential survival and
reproduction in order for this to work
out in the time frame that we have from
4500 years BP or whatever and I'm one of
those who thinks that it's actually a
pretty small advantage pretty small
advantage but persistent generation
after generation no fail it's there if
you have the lactose mechanism for
absorbing calcium and making strong
bones less likely to have rickets less
likely to have Harrison sulcus less
likely to have broken bones and young
adulthood and all those things you'll
have that rigid calcification of bone
which you can see starting right out in
infancy with the lactose effect I mean
that that's amazing can you give us some
idea maybe about the time scale that it
spread on and also it may be some idea
of the the rate of the spread as well as
the point of origin geographically yeah
so what we understand today I'm drawing
mostly on the work of Sarah Tishkoff a
geneticist who's looked at the question
of origins first of all we think there
are multiple mm-hmm I like to call it
the Big Al Jean so I'm gonna just use
that as it's almost slang for me it's
not the technical name but it makes it
easy we use system you use we use l plus
and minus okay all right L minus L plus
is persistent lactase Italian all right
well so L plus and what she shows is
that not all L plus genes are the same
really yep and that there are at least
four different origins of the big
of the l+ gene and they're broken out by
different language families so we're
pretty clear that they had an
independent origin but the selection
pressure is strong enough so there's a
Northern European one and then it turns
out that there's some on the equator in
milk dependent pastoral people's where
the advantage of drinking milk might not
have to do with calcium at all it might
have to do with water availability fluid
availability electrolyte availability if
you live in a desert and you've got this
cow who can concentrate for you from
sparse vegetation and do into a
drinkable water based product there's a
huge advantage especially during drought
seasons and so on so it's quite possible
that that even that those genes had a
different selection pressure that's
amazing so I mean wheat so we've just
learned also about the concept of an
allele and I hear you use the word Gina
just to clarify for us we would say
there are four different lactase
persistent alleles yes we discuss one in
particular that actually is reported in
personal genetics reports at places like
23andme but this is very interesting
that there are multiple other alleles
that could cause lactase versus it's not
clear to me that that the instruction
gene itself is different but the genetic
environment is different enough though
they're markers to show us that it had a
different origin right which is a really
compelling now you said there are
possibly four different alleles that
allow for this and there's you mentioned
a higher latitude origin and then even
an origin and milk dependent populations
near the equator that's correct are
there two other origins as well or
there's there three near the equator and
then there's the one that has evolved
high frequency in Northern Europe and so
is the one from Northern Europe the most
dominant the most dominant in the scent
they're all dominant redolent i should
say right they reach very parallel
frequence very parallel frequencies they
reach very high frequencies both in
these milk dependent pastoral
populations in the deserts of the
equator the Sahara Desert and
surrounding environment and then the
peoples who live at high latitude in the
Denmark what's today Denmark and
Scandinavian Europe so the frequencies
are comparable which is interesting but
not too surprising if a we've had 4,500
years for this to evolve and be if you
have relentless selection pressures
because of the advantage of calcium or
the advantage of electrolytes and water
those are both pretty compelling problem
pressures I don't know I've spent some
time in a desert and I find it very
convincing if you're out of water in the
desert life is tough yeah and a cow is a
wonderful device for giving you water if
the wells are dry if the fields the
crops failed amazing to think that a cow
might be a water tank in the in that it
might be a calcium device in the north
and a water tank yeah out the equator
even if there are negative side effects
and you're not absolutely tolerant I
mean it's worth it for the hydration but
they are you see that's again they've
evolved a high frequency of the gene of
lactase persistence now it's true not
everybody not everyone in the society
the gene is not at fixations we would
say it's not at a hundred percent but
the small number of people who have
diarrhea now there's another this is
that this is where I come back to the
difference between intolerance and
absorption because you can take a mal
absorber so in the population of these
pastoralists living on the equator where
the gene it's not a fixation some people
aren't going to produce lactase and so
therefore you expect them to be
intolerant but what's a really
interesting thing if you look in the
legal documents in the last few years
someone in the US has taken a patent on
a process for converting in tolerant
individuals to tolerance without
changing their genetics and the way it
goes is that you keep giving them a low
dosage of milk a long enough time they
suffer diarrhea diarrhea diarrhea until
their intestinal microflora change and
the result is they become tolerant mal
absorbers now their genes haven't
changed they still lack lactase they
can't produce lactase but now they're
tolerant
so guys already taken out a patent on
this which was in fact in the folklore
in a number of places that if you could
grin and bear it for a while you
drinking milk you could induce tolerance
in yourself you could make yourself you
could go from being tolerant and feeling
bloated and diarrhea and all that you
could come out the other end without
those symptoms so it's possible that in
fact and even in those societies where
milk is so important is in electrolyte
source of electrolytes in water it's
possible that what they've done is
introduced most people are lactose
absorbers and that would help with for
the majority of the population and it's
possible that they induce tolerance in
the malabsorption or likely intolerant
because they're also aware of the gut
microbiota absolutely can essentially
metabolize the lactose for you exactly I
wanted you to offer you from the
diarrhea effects so there maybe you're
not even getting you may not be getting
the full food value but you're at least
not getting the negative effects um
negative symptoms how what proportion of
the world is considered to be lactose
tolerant or not mal absorbers um
personally I go with in the figures vary
usually people put it between seventy to
eighty percent lactose intolerant I
would put it as seventy eighty percent
lactose mal absorber because I don't
really know about the symptomatic so vit
how many how many people have the
symptoms and that it would therefore be
twenty to thirty percent adult
persistent lactase activity uh-huh and
would we assume then that in regions of
the world particularly South America
maybe East Asian Pacific Islands would
be the areas where we have the least
amount of lactase persistent individuals
and tropical Africa in the zone where
tsetse flies discouraged cattle
domestication the geographer Fred
Simmons did a wonderful study
years ago showing that the seat seat
belt of Africa there is there are no
lactose absorbers in that zone that was
one of his first clues is that where
that seat see flies discourage cattle by
the economic disadvantage of sick cattle
which isn't going to work they all have
sleeping sickness and you can't make
them economically productive there's no
milk and there has been no milk for as
long as has been tsetse flies and the
trypanosome the parasite that causes
African sleeping sickness and that is a
long history a long time ago so what
some moons went on to argue is that this
is an area the tropical belt of Africa
with its tsetse fly it really kind of
spans the equator in Tanzania and Kenya
and so on there's a belt there that with
the with a high density of tsetse flies
where that it's never paid to cultivate
cattle and they're lactose smell
absorbers gosh fascinating is it because
right nearby outside the seat season I
the milk dependent pastoralists that
have high levels so it's a wonderful
example of geography culture human
history and genetics all working
together perfect for a biological
anthropology perfect for exactly there's
one more interesting case it's really
fun to talk about oh yeah I want to hear
it and that's the Inuit the Inuit are
heavily melon eyes dwellers of the
Arctic they moved across the Bering
Strait mmm sometimes let's say in the
last twenty thousand years and there
they are with darker skin than you would
expect in the Arctic and very low rates
of rickets almost no rickets they also
aren't lactose absorbers so what do they
do way up there in the land of chronic
vitamin D deficiency very low
ultraviolet how do they make it work it
turns out that before missionaries they
had a practice of eating raw pinniped
livers pinnipeds in turn feed on cod and
small fish like that that non
photosynthetically generate vitamin D
and by eating enough of the livers of
the pinnipeds they concentrate the
vitamin D from this
I'm photosynthetic source and so they
persisted with little evidence of
selection against the epidermal melon
ization and little evidence of selection
for anything like a milk tolerance and
so on and what's so amazing is when
missionaries came in and said oh my gosh
that's barbaric cutting up a seal and
eating raw liver for the delicacy that's
disgusting stop doing that rickets broke
out so what's so interesting I mean on
epidemic of rickets that was terrible
crippling for you at populations what's
so wonderful about this example that
shows there's multiple ways to beat the
rap on calcium epidermal de melon
ization may work the ability to drink
milk in adulthood may work and
harvesting pinniped livers may work and
all of these are interesting and diverse
solutions to this chronic problem built
into our globe of calcium absorption
calcium deficiency that really is
amazing I want to ask you one more
question being sort of thinking from the
anthropological side of things as well
what do you think are the biggest
consequences of a growing human
population with let's say even twenty to
thirty percent that are able to
metabolize lactose because of lactase
persistence are there any major cultural
or other changes that have happened one
of the most interesting consequences of
the discovery of adult lactose
intolerance and intolerance which came
about in the 1960s in the US was that we
had to rethink our food aid can you
imagine we sent thousands of pounds of
dried powdered skim milk to lactose
smell absorbing adults all over the
world it was food aid now if you stop to
think about it that's like sending a
laxative big bags of laxative brought to
you by the friendly people the United
States of America and this came to my
attention before I even heard of the
phenomena of lactose intolerance I was
touring i did some field work in rural
el salvador working a tiny community
called tenancingo and the mayor was
taking me around town
showing me this is our grand re and this
is our well he took me to the
schoolhouse and we walked in met the
children the teacher turned him out so
they could come out and sing a song for
me or whatever and walked through the
school looking at the very simple
infrastructure of the school and in the
corner where all these bags of donated
us dried skim milk and I said don't bet
the why are the bags in the school why
are people using oh don't worry he said
donkey air mo don't worry we do use the
powder in those bags at least twice a
year we get the community together
people bring buckets we put the bags the
powder in the bags and water together
only whitewash the schoolhouse very
grateful for the ability to whitewash
the schoolhouse and I said but why why
why do you use it as white while she
said because the people here gets sick
if they eat that as the intended food
product and you just imagine then in the
ethnographic literature there are
stories of people in Bali lining up to
receive small vials to put it in their
family apothecary family drug supply if
they ever need a laxative they can take
us food aid but we sent thousands of
pounds a year of dried powdered skim
milk to a population where eighty
percent are lactose mal absorbers as a
general human population I think that's
one of the least exposed and and most
obvious gaffes of assuming that what's
true in our society we have a high
frequency of lactose smell absorbers
because of the Northern European
population that was important in the
founding and and the relative growth
rate compared to the Native Americans of
the United States so we have a hot
relatively high frequency of lactase
persistence in adulthood and we assumed
oh just look at the billboards and
things we had everybody needs milk you
never outgrow your need for milk
remember that curve you exactly do
outgrow your need for milk and most
adults do but yet we had this cultural
let us say a cultural cocoon that said o
people everybody needs milk you never
outgrow your need for milk milk does a
body good we had all of these messages
and so we started shipping milk powder
thinking it was easy to concentrate
right you could take milk and make it
dried skim milk you could ship it
quickly it's it stores well the
schoolhouse and then on Cinco I'm sure
still has some in the corner and people
found lots of different ways to use it
well amazing that I'm sorry it is and so
what that helps you to realize is that
it's important I think especially
important for North Americans to open
their eyes and realize that what our
genes encouraged by way of cultural
activities and and a cultural
environment is not necessarily the same
for the rest of the world that's exactly
right that's really all the questions I
have is there anything else you would
it's a classic example you know it's
such a wonderful example of the
interplay of jeans and of culture we
often use it for that and model jeans
and culture is two parallel tracks and
semi independent tracks of inheritance
and what's so great is in this
particular case you can see how well
there's an environmental challenge
coming through and let us say in calcium
and you can see how you could change
your culture and adopt the drinking of
pinniped livers and solve the problem we
could see how you can evolve a high
frequency of the big old gene and solve
the problem or you can live someplace
where that problem is less and and the
problem is actually maybe a protecting
yourself against sunlight and
ultraviolet and so therefore the high
mill anization what i love is this this
idea that to understand the human
organism you can't just study the genes
or the culture you have to have them
both on the table and you have to think
about both of them how they interact how
they may compensate for one another how
they may influence one another because a
totally successful adaptation on the
part of demonization would have if it
had been completely successful you would
be
not very likely to see the evolution of
lactase persistence but didn't solve the
problem and what it shows you is that it
helped but that there was that there's
still a recurrent calcium deficiency at
high latitude which we know from rickets
and other things so I just love this
idea that the study of the human
organism involves thinking about
different kinds of inheritance and their
interaction in time thank you so much of
course thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
