features you're gonna include and you
also know which API is in libraries
you're gonna make use of so now it's
time to make a paper prototype I like to
do this using actual paper but you can
also do it in storyboard or using
Photoshop or any number of prototyping
software Suites linked to some in the
instructor notes below the point of this
exercise is to find how users will flow
through your app and if you're drawing
them by hand you don't need to be
Michelangelo or da Vinci just get your
ideas down on paper will they start with
a login screen and then move to a custom
set of user information or perhaps
they'll start with a list of some kind
and then they can log in later to save
it now you'll want to be as detailed as
you can here I mean what happens when a
button is pressed and where are you
going to be pulling information from the
more information that you can include
here in this paper prototype will help
you down the road
later as you may have noticed user
experience plays a huge role in this
step and if you'd like to think a little
bit more deeply about it Udacity has a
great course on user experience design
it's called UX design for mobile
developers lessons 1 2 3 are what's most
relevant to us in this course so if
you'd like a link to that class is
included in the instructor notes below
if you'd like to work through some of
those exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
