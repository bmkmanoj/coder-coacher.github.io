really an algorithm but it has some
elements in common with them and
algorithms are really cool and that's
what the focus of this class is about
one of the reasons algorithms are cool
is that they're really useful without
careful algorithm design we just don't
see fast enough responses from things
like websites and user interfaces stuff
that we really depend on to be able to
have the computers react quickly another
is that they're really clever they're
really pretty mathematically so just
like a magic trick sometimes learning
how it does what it does can be just as
exciting as what it actually
accomplishes so the practical part of
algorithm design is trying to figure out
how to make your programs fly that is to
say go really really fast and there's a
couple different ways that you can do
this when you're programming one is you
should take a great deal of care and
organizing your program so that they're
not doing a lot of wasteful stuff that
goes without saying but I said it anyway
there's a lot of time that you can spend
tweaking loops and other things in your
program to just get rid of little bits
and pieces of inefficiency and that's
important but perhaps the most important
thing is good algorithm design so
whenever your program is doing something
that involves a great deal of
computation you need to think hard about
how to organize that computation so it
does what you want it to do but it does
it fast and that's the focus of this
course so we can think of the problem of
developing algorithms for particular
problems it's a kind of algorithm itself
here I've written it as kind of faux
Python you can't actually run this if
we're not suggesting this but it should
give you sort of a sense of the flow
here so what we start off with is some
kind of problem specification and we'll
talk about a couple different examples
of those over this course of the course
for the problem specification we're
currently concerned with what we're
gonna do is we're gonna start off
devising an algorithm for that problem
so that means thinking about it coming
up with some kind of a strategy or plan
for doing the computation and we'll call
that our algorithm they're not really
done yet we need to make sure that this
algorithm is actually correct so the
first thing that we want to do when we
propose an algorithm is actually analyze
the correctness with respect to the
problem specification to see if it
actually accomplishes what the problem
says is you're supposed to accomplish
and sometimes that is kind of obvious
and straightforward and sometimes that
involves a fair amount of mathematical
analysis and we'll see different
examples of those as we go once we've
analyzed our algorithm to make sure that
it's correct we can analyze its
efficiency so it does what it's supposed
to do does it do it fast enough and we
eventually determine the running time of
the algorithm if it's not correct
or if it's not fast enough then we need
to continue this process read avise an
algorithm and reanalyze it and keep
doing this until we have something that
both solves the problem and it solves it
fast enough and that's the algorithm
that we declare to be our solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
