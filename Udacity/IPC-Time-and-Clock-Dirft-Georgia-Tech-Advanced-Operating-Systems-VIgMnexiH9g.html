the relationship between the inter
process communication time and both the
individual and the mutual clock drift
that I described to you let mu be the
lower bound on the inter process
communication time so let's now derive
the conditions under which we can assert
that if we have an event a on P I and in
real time it's supposed to precede an
event beyond PJ what are the conditions
that should hold in terms of MU K the
individual clock drift time and epsilon
that is a mutual clock drift time this
first condition is pretty
straightforward it is coming from the
fact that ideally if the clocks are
perfectly synchronized you know that at
time real-time t CI of T and CJ of T
should be exactly the same right you
expect that if it is if the clocks are
perfectly synchronized and it is keeping
with real-time CI of T is equal to CJ of
T equal to T where T is a real time but
there could be individual clock drift
and mutual clock drift which makes them
different from each other and all that
we are saying through this first one is
that this is the act of sending a
message and this is the act of receiving
the message the time stamp that I'm
going to give to this the real time that
I'm going to give to this by reading my
clock it better be higher than the time
at which this message is actually sent
and in order to guarantee that we have
to look at what would be the time that
it takes for this message to go from
here to here that's coming from this mu
the lower bound an IPC so if the message
is sent at CI of T was respect to P I
then the time on P I when this message
is received over here is going to be CI
T plus mu this is the local reading of
the clock when the message would have
arrived at PJ so this is the time
elapsed between sending the message and
when my peer should have received the
message so what we are saying is in
order for making sure that PJ will have
a time stamp that is at least
greater than CI you want to make sure
that the the time reading that I have on
my local cloth T plus mu should be
greater than the time reading at the
time that I sent the message so at the
time that I sent the message from P I my
peers time was C G of T and and all that
we're saying is in order to make sure
that there is no anomaly the first
condition has to hold that says that the
disparity between the two clocks is
within this inter-process communication
line that's all this is saying that the
disparity of the mutual drift is within
this inter process communication time
and the second equation is basically a
difference equation formulation of the
formula that I gave you which I call
pc-1 and this is basically saying that
if K is zero when I read the clock at
time T plus mu and see the difference
between the clock reading now and the
clock reading when I read it at time T
it should exactly be mu but because of
the fact that I may have individual
clock drift it may not be exactly mu but
it may be something different from you
either more or less but very small
difference and so all that we are saying
is that the amount of individual clock
drift should be negligible compared to
the inter process communication time so
the first thing is saying that the inter
process communication time is much
bigger than any clock drift that exists
between two different clocks and the
second equation is saying that the
individual clock drift is very small
compared to MU and if we put all of
these things together you can derive the
expression for inter-process
communication time what it should be
relative to mutual drift and individual
clock drift if this inequality is
satisfied you can avoid anomalies in
your distributed system so informally
what you expect this K is very very
small which means that the denominator
is very close to one so all that we are
saying here is that
the mutual clock drift which is
represented by epsilon is very small
compared to the inter process
communication time which is what is
captured by this condition that I laid
out here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
