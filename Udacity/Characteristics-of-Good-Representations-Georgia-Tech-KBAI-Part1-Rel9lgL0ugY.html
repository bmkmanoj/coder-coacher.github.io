in action we can ask ours also important
question what makes a knowledge
representation a good representation
well a good knowledge representation
makes relationships explicit so in the 2
by 1 matrix problem they were all of
these objects circles and triangles and
dots they were this relationship between
them left off and inside and the
semantic network made all of them
explicit it exposed in natural
constraints of the problem a good
representation works at the right level
of abstraction so it captures everything
that needs to be captured and yet
removes all the details that are not
needed so representation a good
representation is transparent concise
captures only what is needed but
complete captures everything that is
needed it is fast because it doesn't
have all the details that are not needed
and it is compatible it allows you to
draw the inferences that need to be
drawn in order to address the problem at
hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
