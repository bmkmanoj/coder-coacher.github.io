vertex cover algorithm remember the
greedy approximation algorithm is that
while not all edges are covered we
choose a vertex that has the most
uncovered edges then we put that vertex
into the vertex cover so we're going to
modify this by also picking a random
edge each time we go through this loop
and picking one of that edges endpoints
at random and adding that endpoint to
the vertex cover now what I'd like to
know is does this algorithm perform as
well as a factor two approximation
algorithm or maybe does it perform even
better and what I'd like you to do is go
to the forums and I'd like to provide a
proof that does or if it doesn't then
provide a counter example provide a
graph that it doesn't perform as well as
effective to approximation algorithm on
so it could be either one and I'd really
like all of you to discuss this and see
what proofs or counter examples you come
up with so when you've done that go
ahead and post to the forums and then
check this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
