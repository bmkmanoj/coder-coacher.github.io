guessing is delete this relationship
between banded stage right and if i
right click here okay till you feel that
was pleasantly expected yes i want to
delete the relationship gone band is on
its own now that's sad but band you'll
be friends again soon so i'm going to
create a new object so that I can you
know make this whole thing happen right
a new object to be able to track not
only the relationships but maybe other
details about you know what time they're
playing and what the status of it is or
something like that okay so set time now
this is different because before we've
been naming everything like the band
names have actual names attendees have
real names but this set time we're not
going to want to have to name every time
yeah it feels silly and so that's when
you can change the data type of the name
from text to an auto number and the auto
number is just an automatically
generated number okay following this
story Mincy by one exactly yeah so
display format so can i usually like st
yeah well let me get okay that works and
then are those curly braces curly brace
so this means it's gonna start at zero
all right we'll give it a story number
of one okay like that nope just one okay
yep and then it'll increment every time
you create a record it'll susan ones
yeah exactly MN safe okay now i can add
my relationship fields right let me
think about this set time is the child
of both band and stage right so i need
to have put the fields on set time
exactly okay and you can't really have a
stage without set time so should that be
master detail both should be master
detail definitely both should be
required okay so filled that out and
safe and now the next one for bands hey
that's pretty cool yeah I relationship
here looks like our relationship there
yep you built your first Junction object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
