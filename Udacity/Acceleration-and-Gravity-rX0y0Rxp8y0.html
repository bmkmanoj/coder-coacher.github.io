position of objects based on how much
time has elapsed basically the
exposition is some function of time and
the Y position is some other function of
time more interesting however is to set
the position of objects based on their
position in the previous frame using
their velocity if we just do that
however we just get motion at a constant
speed in a straight line to get really
interesting motion we need to take into
account acceleration as well
acceleration is the change in velocity
over time let's take the simple case of
a falling object let's say we've got
some object in free fall and last frame
its position was x and y and it's
velocity was VX and V Y to figure out
where it will be this frame we first
need to update its velocity VX will be
unchanged since gravity is only acting
vertically to find its new vertical
velocity we need to add the elapsed time
of this frame multiplied by the
acceleration due to gravity we can then
use these new velocities to update the
position of the falling object in the
next exercise will see these equations
in action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
