attributes what we're missing is the
operations for the class let me remind
you that operations represent the
behavior of a class and that they might
be found by examining interactions among
entities in the description of my system
so once more let's bring back our
description and let's in this case focus
on this specific item that says that the
students might use the system to add
courses so this is clearly indicating an
action that the students should be able
to perform but notice that this doesn't
mean that this is an operation that
should be provided by the students class
it rather means that there should be
somewhere in the system the possibility
of performing this operation so let's
see what this means
for our example this might mean for
example if we focus on the registration
manager so that there should be an
operation in the registration manager
that allows me to add a student to a
course and this in turn means that both
course and course offering should
provide a way to add a student and
therefore I add this corresponding
operation to the registration manager to
the course and to the course offering so
after doing that we will continue and
populate in a similar way the other
classes in the system let me recap now
we saw how to identify classes how to
identify members of the classes and
particular attributes and operations
there is one thing that we're missing a
very important aspect of the class
diagram which is the relationships
between these classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
