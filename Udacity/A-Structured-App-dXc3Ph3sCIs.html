pretty organized file structure project
files go in the app directory it's got a
single HTML file in several directories
with the two important ones being views
which is for templates and scripts where
all the JavaScript lives notice that the
HTML file includes angular down here at
the bottom let's do a little cleanup by
fixing the indentation here and here
most likely you'll want to include
analytics in your project but for now
I'm going to remove the Google Analytics
code and for the last bit of cleanup
let's remove these nav links the angular
generator bundles grunt into its
workflow grunt is a task runner and out
of the scope of what we'll be covering
but you can find more information about
it in the instructor notes will be using
grunt to serve the project files and
reload the browser when any files change
to start the server just run grunt serve
on the terminal and here's our project
lastly the angular generator package
provides generators for every angular
component we just use this first one to
create the app and we'll be using most
of the others during the rest of the
lesson it might be a good idea to
bookmark this page so you can refer back
to it we saw that angular can be quickly
and easily added to an existing project
just by including a link to angular and
adding the ng-app attribute to the page
but to keep a consistent in organized
project we'll be using yeoman in the
angular generator package to create our
projects now that we know how to get up
and running with a new angular app let's
learn how to create modules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
