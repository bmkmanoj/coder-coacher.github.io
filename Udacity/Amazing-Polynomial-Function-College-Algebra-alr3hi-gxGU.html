we know that a function has the same
number of zeros and the same member of
linear factors as its degree and of
course we need to make sure that we
count the repeats here we've also seen
that complex zeros always come in pairs
as conjugates and we know how to find
Zero's of all different types I think
it's time then to work through an
example that involves multiple
techniques we've learned this is going
to be a great problem to help you
summarize all the important aspects of
determining zeros so get ready for this
amazing polynomial function we have f of
X equals we're off to a pretty good
start 2x to the fourth minus 13 X cubed
plus 32 x squared minus 13x and that's
it I hope you're impressed so if we want
to find the zeros of this function how
do you think the best way to start would
be should we factor the first two terms
and then factor the last two terms
should we grab a snack since it's going
to be a long ride should we pull out the
greatest common factor from all of the
terms should we use the rational zero
theorem involving negative 13 and two
should we divide both sides by X or
should we combine like terms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
