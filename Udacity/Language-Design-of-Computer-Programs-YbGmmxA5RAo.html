been using the Python language obviously
and that has a syntax for statements and
expressions but there are also some sub
parts of Python that seem like quite a
different language one example would be
the language for formatting strings
here's an example from the Python
reference language and you see this
rather bizarre string here with % parens
number sign 0 3 D and so on so there's a
language of format strings itself to
produce this type of output and there
are other parts of the Python language
that allow you to customize it to your
use you can create your own type of
classes and they can have their own type
of expression including operator
overloading so we're used expressions
like X plus y and say if X is 2 and Y is
3 then that would be 5 but you can also
say X plus y where x and y are your own
types of datatypes they might be
matrices they might be components of
some kind of building that you're
building and this can say to put them
together maybe two shapes that you can
concatenate on the screen so you can
define your own language over the types
of objects you want to deal with and you
can go one step farther than that
and define your own domain-specific
language
here's an example this is a language for
describing an optimization problem
having to do with the price and octane
of various types of fuels and you can
describe the parameters and then build a
language processor to take this as input
and compute the output now of course you
could do that with regular Python
statements just as well but here what
we've done is designed a language
specifically for this problem and then
written the problem description in that
language so in this unit we'll cover
what is a language what is a grammar the
difference between a compiler and an
interpreter and how to use languages as
a design tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
