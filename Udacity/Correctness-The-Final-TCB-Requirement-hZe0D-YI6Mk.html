hypervisor may give you better security
we're going to get back to the third
requirement that we have for a trusted
computing base which was getting it
right or having the correctness property
and correctness is really important
because compromise of the trusted
computing base means attacker has access
to everything remember our keys to the
kingdom statement that we had before you
you compromised the operating system you
can access to all the physical resources
every memory page every block on the
disk whatever else is coming in out of
this machine and so on so compromised of
a TCB is is really bad and so we don't
want that and that's why we want the
correctness requirement unfortunately
getting the trusted computing ways the
meeting this correctness requirement is
extremely hard operating systems are
complex there's all kind of concurrency
resource management handling managing
devices or dealing with devices that we
have lots of them and things like that
makes it complex and we know complex is
not good for security or for correctness
so one thing you can do is make the
trusted computing base smaller hopefully
if it's smaller and simpler then you
have a very chance of getting it you
know correct so the third requirement of
a TCB you can see the connection with
virtualization hopefully the hypervisor
is large smaller than the operating
system because all it should do is
petition the physical resources across
the various virtual machines and a lot
of the guests the management of those
you know how those resources get used by
the applications can be done by the
guest operating system their details but
I think the main point to take away from
here is that hypervisor could be smaller
and simpler and if that is true then
securely or having correctness of that
for that obviously going to code it
securely is important with operating
system because it gives you access to
everything it's written in languages are
nor typesafe so keeping that program
smaller and simpler is going to help you
get it right and have that correctness
requirement that we are talking about so
with a hypervisor you may have a better
chance than a full-fledged operating
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
