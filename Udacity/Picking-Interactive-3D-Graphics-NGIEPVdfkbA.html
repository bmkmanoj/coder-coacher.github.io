selecting the object clicked on and if
any object was found then the object
itself was modified in the point clicked
on was highlighted picking objects on
the screen with the mouse is quite
simple in three jeaious here's the first
half of the mouse down function which
sets up to perform picking the bulk of
the code fires array from the eye into
the world this is a common way to
perform picking WebGL itself is focused
on rendering so has no real support for
picking in other forms of interaction
it's up to the program to figure this
out to form array from the eye through
the screen we need two points once the
eyes position in world space that's easy
the other is formed using a point on the
screen that point being located wherever
the user clicked the mouse what we want
to know is this points location in world
space to do so we need to travel
upstream back along the chain of
transformations window coordinates to
normalize device coordinates to view to
world coordinates happily 3GS makes this
easy how many times if I said that
sentence during this course the 2d point
from the mouse down event is a document
object model screen coordinate this is
like a WebGL window coordinate only y
equals zeroes at the top edge of the
screen instead of the bottom the moss
vector code here converts from this
screen coordinate system into normalized
device coordinates which go from
negative 1 to 1 and x and y the Z value
doesn't really matter any value from Z
equals negative 1 to 1 will form a point
on the Ray we next create a projector
object really it's better to create this
object once during initialization and
reuse it here but I wanted to show the
co at all in one piece the final line of
code does the heavy lifting it takes the
NDC coordinate and forms a ray caster
object from it ray casting is like ray
tracing except you only trace rays from
the eye into the scene and no further no
new rains are spawned from intersections
once we have this ray caster object we
can perform picking also called hit
testing it's one line of code to pick
you feed a list of objects into the ray
caster and it returns are an array of
intersections the if statement checks if
the Ray has anything in it if it does
then one or more intersections have been
detected these intersections are sorted
front to back so the first intersection
on the list is the closest which is
usually the one we want this first
intersection has information about what
the Ray hit including the object face
and the faces index in the object we use
the object parameter in the next line to
change the
to a random color the intersex record
also includes the distance and the point
in world space to show where the object
was hit we had a small sphere to the
scene using this intersection point for
its location these are just examples you
can do whatever you like with the
intersection information you get back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
