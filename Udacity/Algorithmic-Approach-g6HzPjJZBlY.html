from getting out of hand if it doesn't
need to be we're going to look at one
special operation and let me let me draw
a picture of it first and then we'll
talk about it more mathematically all
right so do you do you see what I drew
here a web yeah it doesn't doesn't look
so great does it so this is this is
intended to be a piecewise linear convex
function so basically a value function
and remember that that what we end up
doing is over belief space this the
black line here we're going to be taking
the max over all these linear functions
so we get we get this this upper surface
wait I see you can get rid of any of the
vectors that don't ever participate in
the max because they don't matter yeah
and so that's going to keep our our
vector sets potentially from blowing up
if they don't need to so in this
particular case I drew what 1 2 3 4 5
vectors but only three of them are
really needed to represent the function
this one's not needed and this one's not
needed so we can define a computational
operation that we call purge that takes
a bag of vectors and shrinks it down
purges it perches out any of vectors
that aren't really needed to represent
the the upper surface the piecewise
linear convex function wait how
computationally complicated is it to do
that that's a good question thank you so
how computationally complicated is it um
it's at least linear it's at least
linear yeah and so there's some quick
test that you can do so let's look at
this vector first this vector number one
here if you look what you can see is
that over belief space this this 01 zone
here there's another vector specifically
this one call it vector to that always
dominates it it is always the case that
you can do better by taking vector 2
instead of vector 1 so if there's a
vector that is dominated by another
vector you could totally throw it out
which you ought to be able to figure out
by doing something cute like multiplying
them together taking their co-signatory
angles there's something you ought to be
able to do to figure that out actually
all you have to do is check the corners
if it's bigger than both 0 and 1 then it
must be bigger the whole way through
well in particular let's say we have two
vectors like this alpha that with
components alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3 and
that's this this is the this vector and
the other vectors represented by alpha 1
prime alpha 2 prime alpha 3 prime if
it's the case that alpha one is bigger
than alpha 1 Prime and alpha 2 is bigger
than alpha 2 Prime and alpha 3 is bigger
than alpha 3 prime then this vector is
not needed
right no matter what police did you
stick in you're going to get a higher
value or out by using this vector than
that one does it have to be strictly
dominated can't just be dominated so if
if if one is greater than or equal to
the other you can get rid of the one
that is less than equal to right yes all
right that's neat yeah there's some
subtleties to doing this consistently in
my in my dissertation I talked about how
you can use a lexicographic ordering of
the vectors to make sure that you only
keep things that really are going to be
needed someplace but that is a subtlety
that I don't think is very important for
this this dominated check is actually
really easy to do and it's very fast but
unfortunately it's not sufficient so
let's look at this vector call it number
three this one is better than each of
the other vectors at some point along
the way but the union of the other
vectors the union of these three vectors
dominates it so showing that is actually
considerably more difficult like knowing
that three doesn't matter isn't needed
because over here it's dominated by this
vector over here it's nominated by this
vector and over here it's nominated by
that vector wait what you said isn't
true three is dominated by the one that
first does the max all the way through
you mean this one for ya yes that is a
good point huh alright that sounds like
a quiz okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
