subject hits the ground well now it's no
longer accelerating so Galileo statement
doesn't make any sense
in fact Galileo didn't spend too much
time thinking about objects at rest he
was much more interested in motion so
let's think what will Newton be saying
now well now that the balls at rest the
acceleration is zero and according to
this equation which is a law of physics
it must always be true a zero
acceleration must correspond to a force
of zero so what happened did gravity
just turn off all of a sudden no of
course not the ball is still being
pulled down by gravity and I'm going to
label gravity as mg from now on where m
is the mass of this ball and G is the
acceleration due to gravity that 10
meters per second squared so what's
going on according to this force diagram
the ball ought to be accelerating
downwards there's a force downwards well
here we're saved by the fact that force
is what's called a vector I'm
representing this force with an arrow
because the force has a direction
associated with it downwards by adding a
force in the opposite direction we can
actually cancel this force which of the
following arrows do you think best
represents the force needed to cancel
this downwards mg choose what you think
is the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
