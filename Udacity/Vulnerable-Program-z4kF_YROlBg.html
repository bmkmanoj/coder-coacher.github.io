simplified program what it's doing is
something similar to what a password
checking program I do think about what
the program is doing this is our main
function as the program it has take some
arguments it has a bunch of local
variables it has an integer that value
at the end is going to be should log and
be allowed or not allowed it has a local
variable of size no more than 12 that's
where we're going to read the password
that we're gonna ask the user to type
and then we have to compare that with
something that we know about the
password of the user so the target
password here really is the password
we're looking for here this is a really
poor practice here but the target
password is hard-coded other thing I
should mention here is that fast for
checking programs actually don't need to
keep your password because then if
somebody gains control of that then they
know your password also so these are
sort of the the local variables that we
declared within this function this is
where we get to the code the code is
very simple it's saying I'm going to get
a string get s is read a string function
get a string that you're going to type
we're gonna read that string into this
local variable password string that we
declared then we're going to do a
comparison of this string that we just
read into PW DST are against our target
password which is my password one two
three this string compare actually is is
this variant says at most 12 character
long strings and the result of this
comparison if the two strings are
identical then it returns a zero
otherwise it returns a nonzero value so
read more about this function to find
out exactly what it returns in other
cases less than zero or greater than
zero so in this case a la login is set
to one after that we're going to say if
allow login is zero remember that is the
initial value we assumed that we don't
allow unless there is a match remember
the failsafe defaults we talked about
the default here is is don't allow so
that's why we setting it to zero so if
the variable was not set to one as a
result of a successful comparison then
it's still zero
and in that case we're going to reject
the login request otherwise the match
was successful we set it to 1 so in that
case we're going to allow the login
request but the goal here is to
understand how vulnerable code gets
exploited so we want to see how this
code gets exploited and this simple
program that we have here helps us do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
