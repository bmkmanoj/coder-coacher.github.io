the Roger Shang proposed quite a while
back actually he used different names
with these primitive actions there's a
modern interpretation let's walk through
these fourteen actions very quickly so
move body part is where a shirk might
for example move his hand from one
position to another position move object
is where a shirk may move an object
let's say a car from his office to his
home expellers when a shirk might exhale
and just as when a shirk might eat
something and so on and so forth
propeller is when a shirk might kick a
ball so it right now chokes bodies in
contact with the ball and the ball is
being kicked notice that some of these
primitive actions have to do with mental
actions so think about or move concept
or conclude or feel so move concept is
where a sure give the idea to Susie
about going to a movie conclude has to
do with decision making think about is
just forming an idea inside one's mind
some of these have to do with percepts
and sensor see smell hear now these
fourteen primitive actions form an
ontology of actions what is an ontology
we have come across this notion earlier
an ontology is a specification of a
conceptualization of the world there is
the world outside we hear a read stories
about the world all the time the stories
help make sense of the world and these
stories then use different kind of
categories different kind of concepts
those concepts in AI need to be
specified very very precisely and when
we specify those concept in terms of
which we make sense of the world we cut
our ontology so here is an ontology here
are the 14 basic concepts the 14 basic
categories of primitive actions in terms
of which will try to make sense of a
large number of stories about the world
now you might say that is 14 primitive
actions don't cover all the possible
stories in the world and it's probably
true you might also say that you can
come up with a different ontology or a
different set of primitive actions and
that might also be the case so some of
you may want to try your own hand come
and come up with ontology
that's not the point the point here is
that we can now come up with an ontology
a primitive action
and program AI agents using that
ontology so that the agent can now
understand a very large number of
stories and that's powerful so it shook
one common story that comes to mind it
looks like it would be difficult to put
in terms of these primitive actions is
something like I walked across the room
in which case I'm the one doing the
moving but I'm also the one being moved
how would you put that in terms of these
primitive actions David that's a good
point
one way of capturing the meaning of that
story in terms of these primitive
actions isn't to use the move object
primitive action so here both the object
being moved and the mover of the object
is the same I so I am moving myself one
place to the other place and in there is
point here is that these primitive
actions will be able to capture the
meaning of some sentences in a very
simple logical intuitive sense and for
some other sentences it might be a
little bit more involved so let us see
how this primitive actions may actually
help any agent make sense of stories so
here is the first thing we can do recall
there were large number of stories each
expressed by one sentence Ashok ate a
frog should devour the Frog and so on so
now eight devoured consumed ingest
partook we can think that each one of
them really is an instance of a
primitive action called ingest here is
the primitive action ingest so a shock
ingested a frog here a shock ingested a
frog here a joke Ashok ingested a frog
here well support fish early these
particular sentences are different in
terms of their deep meaning the deep
meaning is pretty much the same it is
true of course that devour may have a
slightly different interpretation then
dining devour might be something that I
ravish with my hands for example and
dining might involve fine dining with
silverware nevertheless ingest captures
the basic meaning of these sentences
what is the basic meaning the basic
meaning again is that Ashok has an agent
frog is the object that is getting eaten
ingested initially the frog was outside
a shark's body and probably dead or
alive we don't know its state after the
ingestion has occurred or devoured as a
co2 consumed has occurred the frog is
inside the shark's body and it's dead
and further that Ashok probably is happy
at the end of this particular ingestion
where does all of that knowledge coming
from it's buried inside you frame for
ingest so each of this premiere
deduction is a frame corresponding to it
and we have come across frame many times
welded in the classical by now you
should know what it means and the frame
has a large number of slots like agent
Co agent object beneficiary and so on
and those slots deal with stereotypical
situations and have default values
already put in there so when a sentence
comes like Ashok ate a frog then the
verb ate here pulls out the primitive
action ingest and refrain from this
primitive action and the processing
becomes top-down and they start thinking
why will a show go where will frog go
who is the agent who is the object and
so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
