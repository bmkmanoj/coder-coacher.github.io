sometimes factored into the illumination
model is described by the Finnell
equations these equations were
discovered by the French engineer and
physicist Augustin Jafra nel he received
little recognition of his work in optics
while he was alive much of it was
published after his death in 1827
happily what evidently gave and most
pleasure was the discovery and
experimental confirmation of a
scientific theory the fernell equations
themselves have to do with the amount of
reflection and refraction off a surface
the basic relationship is this the more
on edge you look at a surface the more
reflective it is if the surface is
refractive in other words transparent
the amount of light transmitted will
drop off considerably as you approach
this shallow angle my favorite example
is a lake or the ocean the next time
you're in shallow water notice that you
can look straight down and see the
bottom as you look out towards the
horizon the angle of your eye to the
surfaces normal approaches 90 degrees
and reflection will dominate for
materials that aren't transparent this
effect still takes place the final
effect is particularly noticeable for
what are called dielectrics which is a
fancy way of saying insulators in other
words materials such as glass plastic
and clay for example glass is about 25
times as reflective at a shallow angle
then directly hit on an experiment you
can do right now to prove this to
yourself take a sheet of normal paper
nothing very shiny or rough and put it
on a flat surface such as a book hold
the paper so that you're holding it
nearly edge-on and look towards a lit
area such as a window here I'm using the
tablet at nearly 90 degrees to the
surface normal you'll see the paper
become quite reflective in fact the
fernell effect should also lessen the
diffused contribution as the object
becomes more reflective in real life
there are less photons left to go off in
other directions there is one
implementation detail I want to mention
you should use the normal that
represents the mirror orientation for
example for a mirror reflective surface
this is simply the shading normal for
most other materials it's not with the
blinn-phong illumination equation the
idea is that the material is made of
micro facets only a few facets are
angled just right to reflect light
towards the eye these facets have normal
vectors pointing exactly halfway between
the light and eye vectors recall that
this special direction is called the
half angle vector happily this is a
vector we compute anyway for specular
highlighting but it's important to use
this direction and not the shading
normal try the demo to get a sense of
the effect notice how a nearly edge-on
angle
as the reflectivity to increase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
