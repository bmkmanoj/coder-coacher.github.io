machines in a variety of ways let's
start with a tabular form called a state
transition table here the rows
correspond to States and there are four
columns one column for the name of the
state another for the input event which
is going to cause the transition the
third for whatever output action is
going to be taken upon the transition
and the fourth for the next state that
is the state transition table is going
to capture the idea that a system in a
given State when given a certain
stimulus and when a stimulus occurs is
possibly going to produce some action or
response and leave itself in a an estate
possibly the same or possibly a
different state to see how this works
let's imagine a garage door opening
system in fact a simplified version of
my garage door opening system okay it's
got a motor and that motor can be
lifting the door up it can be pushing
the door down or it can be stopped
there's a button that can be pressed to
turn the motor on and off the door
itself can be all the way open all the
way closed or stopped at some
intermediate intermediate state along
the way importantly the is what happens
when you press the button and in this
particular garage door situation okay
what happens when you press the button
can be one of three things depending
upon what state you're in if the motor
is stopped and you press the button it
starts going but in the opposite
direction it was going before if the
motor is going upward and you hit the
button it stops leaving the door
wherever it was at that time however for
security or safety reasons if the motor
is going downward and you press the
button it not only stops but then it
immediately turns on and goes in the
other direction presumably because
something was detected that might be
damaged by the door going down on it and
implicit in this is some sensors one
sensor determining whether the door is
all the way up and another sensor saying
whether the doors all the way down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
