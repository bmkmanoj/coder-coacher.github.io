just looked at on your own during the
project portion of this lesson there's
just one more thing I want to cover
though before I set you loose on that
and that is how to think about selecting
how many principal components you should
look at so in that last example they
went from eighteen hundred and fifty
features on the input to a hundred and
fifty principal components and the
question you might be wondering is how
do they come up with that number it's a
little bit tough to answer that because
there's no cut and dry answer for how
many principal components you should use
you kind of have to figure it out which
of these options do you think sounds
like a good way to figure out how many
principal components you should be using
here are your options the first one is
just always take the top 10% as a rule
of thumb a second option is that you can
train on a different number of principal
components and then see how the accuracy
response for each of those possible
numbers of principal components and then
once you do this several times it'll
become clear that there's a point of
diminishing returns where as you add
more principal components you don't get
much more in terms of discrimination and
then you should cut off once you start
to Plateau and the third option is that
you could perform feature selection on
the input features before you put them
into PCA and then you just use as many
principal components as you had from
input features after you've performed
that selection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
