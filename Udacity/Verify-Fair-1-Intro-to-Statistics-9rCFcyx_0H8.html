and this time we go to a bank and hope
to get a fair coin ass golden coin over
here and our alternate hypothesis is a
two-sided hypothesis the probability
either is smaller than 0.5 or larger
than 0.5 which provide us P unequal 0.5
and the way to look at is conceptually
in all we've done so far we assume that
h0 is correct
we'd computed some sort of distribution
and then we carved out a critical region
such as the volume underneath for
smaller equal to 5% assuming you earned
five percent confidence now in the
two-sided test what we do is cover the
smaller region on the left but also one
on the right such that the area on the
Left doesn't exceed half of five percent
that is 2.5 percent and the same for the
area on the right so now we've moved the
critical region into two areas you have
a two-sided test now that's called a
two-tailed tests and in totality the two
critical regions are left and right
don't exceed 5% so this looks awfully
like a confidence interval right so
let's flip the coin in 14 experiments
heads comes up exactly three times and
11 times it comes up tails let's do the
analysis so in this table I've graphed
to you the probabilities under the
binomial distribution for each possible
outcome from 0 to 14 as before they go 0
zero point zero zero five point zero two
two point zero six point one two point
one eight point two one this is
obviously the most likely outcome for
the null hypothesis and then it goes
down exactly the way it went up over
here I've also added check boxes I want
you to check exactly those that define
the critical region so the total
probability in the critical region does
not exceed five
and remember this is a two-tailed test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
