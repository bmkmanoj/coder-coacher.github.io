you've used a single loop to solve a
problem sometimes you need to have more
than one loop and in fact it can happen
that you have one loop sitting inside
another such loops are called nested
loops let me give you an example we want
to write a program that draws this
square of colors starting with a black
one
increasing the greenness in this
direction increasing the blueness in
that direction how can we draw all of
these squares let's think of it a row at
a time for example to draw this row here
I need to go from x equals 0 then to X
equal whatever the width of this square
is which is 30 in our example so that x
equals 30 60 90 and so on and that'll be
a loop that loop will draw all of the
squares in a particular row to get to
all rows I need another loop and there
you have it a loop inside a loop nested
loops now the only tricky task remains
if I have row I and column J how do I
find out the position and the color of
this square you'll get to try that out
in the next exercise just keep in mind
that as the row index I goes 0 1 2 3 and
so on you want the Y position to be 0 30
60 90 and so on and SJ the column index
goes from 0 to the number of columns you
want the X offset also to be 0 30 60 and
so on
how about the colors we want the square
down here to have green 255 and blue 255
all the Reds are 0 so you want the
greenness to vary from 0 to 255 and
equal increments in this direction and
you want the blueness to vary from 0 to
255 in equal increments in that
direction you just have to figure out
the increments alright go ahead and give
that a try and as you do that closely
look at those two nested loops that
you'll be working with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
