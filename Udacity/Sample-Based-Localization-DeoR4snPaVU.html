robot is actually going to do is it's
going to follow this purple line okay so
this is where it starts and then it goes
here and it moves that way what we're
showing you to begin with is a couple of
things first of all you see all those
red dots that's its current set of
particles in other words it has no idea
where it actually is the green is an
example of where it thinks it might be
in fact this is the locally most likely
which is just some way of the robot
guessing where it is now what I'm not
showing on this map is the for each
particle there's also a theta right
particles have to represent the state
what do we say our state was we said it
was X Y and theta it's hard to show this
in three so I'm only showing X and watch
all right but for any given theta that I
think it is then I would be sending out
array of sensor measurements and I think
I know where it should hit because why
because I have a complete map okay so
what happens is first you're gonna your
eye is just going to naturally go to the
green thing what's going on there is
that's the set of sensor measurements
that it's getting though so wherever
wherever it thinks it is it puts down
the measurements it actually got now if
it's in the right place those
measurements will actually most of the
time hit the wall at the right distance
every now and then it'll go right
through the wall because it was a no
return all right so let me just put it
in motion it's easier to understand all
right so here we go so it's a movie so
each one of these changes is when it
thinks it is when it takes a measurement
and you'll notice there's a clump of
particles here in fact that's the most
likely clump and there's also a clump of
particles there that's so nice way of
saying the robot does not know whether
it's definitely here or definitely there
and the reason for that is the hallway
is kind of symmetric right there are
these doors okay but there's doors on
both sides so it hasn't yet been able to
disambiguate if this is the center of my
universe whether it's at this area or
that area but let me put it back in
motion what's going to happen is the
robots going to go inside in the room
and you'll notice in this room in the
room it's about to go into there's a
ottoman or whatever that is in the
middle that's not in the other room so
when it once it goes in yep there it
goes okay you'll notice the particles
that are in the wrong place they're
going to disappear okay now some of the
rays are still going in the wrong
direction because not sorry the right
there they're going through the walls
but that's just the no return and you'll
notice by the time we get to the end of
the run you'll notice that it has
localized itself very well some of the
measurements still go through the walls
because I'm assuming those were no
returns but just by taking these simple
one dimensional measurement several of
them at a time and knowing the map and
taking its movements it's able to
localize exactly where it is and that's
sort of a hallmark of particle filtering
you start off with a big unknown set and
eventually a whole bunch of particles go
away because they are just totally
inconsistent with the measurements you
get so when they get multiplied by P of
Z given X the likelihood of that
measurement is so small that it
diminishes that particles weight a lot
and the next time you sample and we said
this is then remember a very low weight
particle sometimes don't get sampled at
all so what happens is only the samples
that are near the parts of the sensor
measurements that are consistent survive
and you keep iterating also remember we
had the two lumps for a while there
because I wasn't sure whether it was
this one or that one because it didn't
have enough information to know yet it
wasn't until it went inside that room
that it had that information and this is
sort of the inherent advantage of
particle filtering over say a Kalman
filter that has a single hypothesis for
those of you who may be heard of multi
hypothesis tracking where you you end up
having multiple hypotheses one way of
thinking of particle filters is it gives
me just a uniform and easy way of doing
multi hypothesis tracking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
