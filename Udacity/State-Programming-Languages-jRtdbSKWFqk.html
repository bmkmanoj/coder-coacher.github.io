order to figure out whether an
expression is true or not or what it
evaluates to we're going to need to keep
track of the values of variables with my
which might change with assignment
statements so we're going to track the
current state of the world is x1 or is
x2 we don't know yet is the King of
France bald or not we're going to have
to find out it's a question that can be
answered empirically by looking at the
state of things so to figure out what an
expression like X plus 2 means when
we're doing our interpreting when we're
writing our web browser we're going to
need to keep around some notion of the
values of variables the state of the
world and we're going to do that with a
mapping from variable names like X 2
values in Python dictionary style that
might be something like X currently has
the value 3 this mapping is called the
state and this is a super important
concept in programming languages it's
kind of like asking what's the current
temperature depends on the current state
of the world and it may change over time
we'll need a lot of bookkeeping to keep
track of it so as we hinted earlier a
fairly direct way to do this would be
just to use a Python dictionary that
map's strings variable names to values
if we had something like this we could
easily evaluate x times y in this
context in this state and determine that
it's true for this state right now x is
2 right now Y is 3 2 times 3 is 6 so the
value of this expression is true if this
is the state of the world now later we
may want our environment to be a little
more complicated than just a single
Python mapping so we're going to
introduce an abstract function to query
it so we'll just make a promise to
ourselves we're going to write a
function called environment look up
where you pass in an environment
probably a dictionary but we may make it
more complicated later and a variable
name and you get the answer out so if
this is our environment II calling
envelope of this environment II and
asking for the variable Y gives us back
the value 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
