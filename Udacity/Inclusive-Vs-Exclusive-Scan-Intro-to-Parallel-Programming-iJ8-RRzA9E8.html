flavors of scan the one I just presented
is exclusive scan the output at each
location is a function of all the
elements that came before not including
the current element so let's see what
the output would be if we do a some scan
on this eighth element input array so
this is straightforward to compute and
let's just keep in mind the output here
is the sum of all elements that come
before it but not including it inclusive
scan is defined slightly differently
whereas exclusive scan summed up all the
elements that came before and didn't
include the current element inclusive
scan instead sums up all the elements
before and including the current element
so let's see what the answer is here and
so an inclusive scan this element is the
sum of all elements up to and including
the current element now we're not really
covering applications of the scan
primitives in this lecture we'll do
these in the next lecture so it's not
immediately obvious why you might need
both flavors but what you'll find is
that some algorithms are best expressed
using an inclusive scan others prefer
using an exclusive scan it's likely that
if you use a library that contains scan
primitives you'll have access to both
flavors fortunately it's fairly
straightforward to convert between them
if you need to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
