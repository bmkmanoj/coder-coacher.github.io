this let me go to attendee new filled
formula total spent yep return type
currency probably makes sense yep
alright so we want to add our formula
and I'm trying to figure out how to do
this like you know 50 times tickets sold
or a hundred times ticket sold but it
depends on the ticket type yeah so
before this we've been dealing with
pretty simple formulas where it's just
addition or multiplication but in this
case we're adding a little bit of
conditional logic where we're trying to
figure out if it's one value do this if
it's another value do this so let's go
to the advanced formula tab and then
look at some of the functions that we
have available to deal with that kind of
stuff on the right hand side we have all
the different functions you have
available if you click on that little
pick list you can even change it to
functions on specific things in this
case it'll be a logical function we want
because we're logically trying to figure
out if one thing or if the other so
immediately it's like if statement makes
sense right but if you didn't know what
you needed you could Google it or go to
the forums all that's totally fine way
to find it what does this part mean the
if logical test value of true value of
false so that's a little sample of the
syntax of how to use the if statement
and what the logical test means is you
provide it some sort of function that
will be true or false like so you type
equals VIP exactly okay and so if ticket
type is VIP it'll do this first do the
first thing which is like a hundred
times the ticket number sold number sold
and then if it isn't VIP then it'll do
the second parameter okay
so 50 times to get sold yes so that
would be the general mission so that's
what I do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
