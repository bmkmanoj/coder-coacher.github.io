my answer so I'm gonna select this line
and I'm actually gonna use the Python
IDE to figure out the kind of the
structure of this document here we are
in the IDE I'm gonna paste in that first
line so I pasted in that first line it's
in a variable called reddit front we can
go ahead and run length on it see it's
26 thousand characters okay so the first
thing I'm gonna do is import JSON and
then I'm going to convert this this
document into JSON using the loads
function and the JSON module so now I've
got this big dictionary J and it's got
all this stuff in it actually that
wasn't very useful just bring it
everything so let's look at J dot keys
we can see there are two keys here kind
and data data is almost certainly the
one we want let's look at that another
bunch of stuff let's look at the keys on
this this has just four keys after
before children and mod hash children is
going to be the one we want the other
ones are just simple little variables so
let's look at children now we're
starting to get somewhere let's look at
the keys of this it's a list so it's
probably a list of links which is kind
of what we were expecting let's look at
one of these okay again a bunch of crap
let's look at the keys for the first
element in the links or in this
children's list we can see that it has
kind and data so let's look at the data
for this guy wow we're starting to get a
little bit closer let's see what the
keys are for this guy
aha perfect and we can see that UPS is
actually in this so if I were to call up
so we can see that it is the integer of
the number of opps on this link so
that's how I found this so looking at
our total JSON document we're gonna look
at data we're gonna look at children and
then for each of the children we're
gonna sum up the ups and if I were to
change this 0 to a 1 to find the second
element in the list we can see that we
get another variable I'm gonna take this
piece of code with me into the IDE and
we're gonna write our function to add up
all of the apps okay here we are in the
IDE and what we want to do is we want to
sum up all of the up so I can say sum
and I'm gonna say C data ups for C in
data children basically what I'm doing
is I'm iterating over the list data
children which we know is a list for C
in each element in that list I'm gonna
look up data ups on that object C and
then we're going to sum it up using the
Python built-in function sum and I'm
just going to return that let's give
that a run ah
J's not to find that means I didn't load
the actual string of the reddit front
page in JSON
into a JSON object so let's do that
let's run that again there we go now we
see our answer a hundred and three
thousand nine hundred and seventy eight
simple enough and what I wanted you to
accomplish there was just learn how to
you know load this into JSON and then
manipulate the data structure a little
bit and you can see it's just like
manipulating any Python data structure
because JSON maps very cleanly to what
we already have been working with in
Python which is dictionaries and lists
and integers and floats and that sort of
thing so pretty handy there you are now
