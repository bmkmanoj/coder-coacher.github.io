would I want to reduce factors first
well what if I wanted to find three
tenths x 512 I could draw a diagram of a
candy bar and split up the pieces before
I can split up in the tents and then 12
but that's kind of a lot of work and I
know I just really need to multiply the
two fractions multiplying these two
fractions together I get 15 / 120 but
now I have to figure out if i can
simplify this and how to simplify this
fraction this can be frustrating working
with large numbers so let's make our
work easier and simplify our fractions
first I know ten can be written as 2
times 5 and 12 can be written as 3 times
4 remember any number divided by itself
makes one like 4/4 mix 15 / 5 mix 1 it
doesn't work 40 but we should keep this
in mind when we're simplifying here i
have 3 divided by 3 so that makes 1 and
5 divided by 5 so that also makes one
now I can just multiply my new murders
so i have 1 times 1 which is one and i
have 2 times 1 times 1 times 4 or i have
2 times 1 times 1 times 4 which i know
that's just really 2 times 4 or 8 so 15
/ 120 is really the same thing as 18 I'm
showing you this longer method so you
can really see why we can cancel factors
you can do it ahead of time and this is
what it would look like I know five and
ten share a common factor of five so i
can divide them both by five 5/5 mix 1
10 / 5 mix 2 3 and 12 also share a
factor of 3 so 3 / 3 mix 1 and 12 / 3
mix for now I multiply just like before
1 x 1 is 1 and 2 times 4 is 8 so either
way I do it this long way or the shorter
way with cross canceling I get one
eighth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
