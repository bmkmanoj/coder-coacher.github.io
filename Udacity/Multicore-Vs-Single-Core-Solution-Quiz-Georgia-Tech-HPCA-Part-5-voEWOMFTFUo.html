multi core versus single core quiz this
is what we had in the old technology in
the new technology one of these cores is
going to be half the size and half the
power so we had the option of either
replacing that with a better core that
occupies the whole area gets a small IPC
but consumes slightly more power and
then the question is if we do consume
the whole power budget of the chip which
is a hundred watts how much can we
increase this frequency and with that
frequency what is the overall speed up
versus what we had in the old technology
the other option was just put the two
cores that we can now fit on the chip
each now gets us the same IPC as the
single core did and together they
consume the whole power budget of the
chip at two gigahertz so the question is
what's the speed up versus the old
technology with the two core approach
the first thing we need to figure out
here is how much can we raise this
frequency here so that we get to 100
watts well we are allowed to increase
the power from 75 watts to a hundred
watts that's a factor of 1 point 33
remember that the dynamic power is
proportional to voltage squared times
the frequency itself and that we have to
increase the voltage in proportion to
frequency so if we are spending power to
increase the frequency we have to
proportionally get both the voltage in
the frequency up and that means that we
will be spending power in proportion to
the cube of the frequency that means
that the frequency that we can operate
on is cubic root of 133 times the old
frequency and this is equal to 1.1 so
our new frequency is 1.1 times the old
frequency the old frequency was 2
gigahertz that means we can achieve 2.2
gigahertz when we increase the power x
factor of 1.33 the speed-up we achieve
versus the old technology will be the
speed up we achieve because of a shorter
clock cycle time and that speed up is
1.1 times
so we are 1.1 times faster now in terms
of clock frequency times the speed up we
achieve because our IPC is better and if
we divide 3.5 and 2.5 we get a factor of
1.4 times the speed up we achieve
because we have fewer instructions but
because we are executing exactly the
same code that speed up is one we don't
speed up really so our overall speed up
is just this and it ends up being one
point 54 now let us look at the two core
option we have the same IPC as before
but we now have two chords that are
doing that so we are executing twice as
many instructions as before at the same
frequency and at the same power so the
speed up versus the old system here will
simply be too we are operating at the
same frequency splitting the same work
into two pieces and each of the pieces
is now done at the speed where we were
doing only one of the pieces so overall
we are getting a speed-up of 2 as you
can see two cores are achieving a better
speed up relative to the old system than
a fancier core which means that if we
indeed do have programs that can use the
two cores effectively then this is the
better option then improving the core
and consuming the chip area that way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
