rotation here's a simple example again
let's look at this and now have the same
corner in this instance is appearing and
another image with rotation now in this
case if we were to go through the whole
process in computing the details that
would actually let us do the ellipse
which basically would have the
eigenvalues and stuff like that again
we're not doing this directly but we
actually look at second moments which
allows us to get to similar information
for this point and this point the
eigenvalues should be the same the size
of the eye the ellipse that we're
looking at should be the same but what
should not be is of course the rotation
its orientation has changed from this to
this but the eigen values remain the
same
since our is only dependent on the
eigenvalues of the ellipse it basically
suggests that the corner response
function r is invariant image rotation
so this object can beat rotated
completely as long as these values are
the same we should still get the same
our function and with thresholds and
stuff we'll still get the same point and
in fact that's what would suggest that
these two corners of this image would be
identified in both the pairs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
