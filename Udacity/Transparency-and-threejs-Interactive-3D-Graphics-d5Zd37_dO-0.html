transparency that mostly works to sum up
all the opaque objects are rendered
first with z-buffering on blending is
then turned on for the transparent
objects that follow blending takes extra
time for the GPU to compute so it's
turned on only when needed
finally the transparent objects are
sorted by their distance along the view
and are rendered and back to front order
if the camera or objects are moving this
sorting has to be done every frame this
algorithm is in fact with three jeaious
implements you make an object
transparent by setting its material
there are two parameters to set the
opacity is the Alpha value used for
blending
you must also set the transparent
parameter to be true this transparency
scheme usually works fairly well in
practice
but there are still quite a few problem
cases one problem is interpenetration
here's a demo showing one transparent
block moving through the other give this
demo a try move the camera around and
use the slider to position the block the
dot in the center of each object is what
is used to measure its distance along
the direction the camera is viewing once
you're done with the demo you'll then
answer a question as to what's going
wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
