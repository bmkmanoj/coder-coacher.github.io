reason is from a 2,100 square foot home
that's clearly smaller than this one the
price has decreased it's gone down do we
believe that in general between a 2100
sphere at home in 2003 a few nights ago
at home the price should go down do we
actually believe in the scatterplot like
this the functional relationship between
size and cost goes like this
or do we instead believe it should go
like this and the deviations from that
linear graph is what's called noise now
noise might not be the best term but
it's a term to test Asians use it might
be that one of them has a great view the
next one has an old house
this one has costal axis which makes it
more expensive
this one really requires a new kitchen
there might be factors that really
affect the house price beyond this the
size but if those factors aren't
included to a statistician that's called
random noise but coming back to my
original question I think we don't
believe the red curve so let's talk
about bar charts as one way to alleviate
the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
