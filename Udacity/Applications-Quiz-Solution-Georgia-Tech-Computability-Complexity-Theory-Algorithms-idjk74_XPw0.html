roommate problem we make a vertex for
each individual and we add an edge
between two vertices if the two
individuals are compatible we find a max
matching and match edges become
roommates this is a great application of
maximum matching but more likely than
not there will be an odd cycle of
compatibility meaning that the graph is
not bipartite this changes the nature of
a problem significantly the taxi problem
on the other hand is clearly bipartite
we model the taxis with one set of
vertices and the customers with the
others and we want to find the minimum
total pickup time we can imagine having
edges between the taxis and customers
finding a matching here and adding up
all of these times the problem here is
the existence of the costs which demand
a different solution from just finding a
maximum matching assigning professors to
classes is a bipartite matching problem
one side of the partition is the
professors and the other is the classes
and we include an edge if the professor
is qualified to teach each class a
maximum matching exclusion then will
allow us to teach as many classes as
possible hopefully this will be all of
them the situation with organ donors and
patients is analogous we add an edge if
the patient will accept the organ and we
match as many organs to the patient as
we can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
