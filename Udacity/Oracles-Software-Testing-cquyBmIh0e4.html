Oracle's and we've really probably have
deferred this topic for too long so
Oracle's are extremely important for
random testing because if you don't have
an automated Oracle that is to say if
you don't have an automated way to tell
if a test case did something interesting
then you've got nothing and in fact
Richard Hamlett in his sort of
well-known article on random testing
said that random testing has only a
specialized niche in practice because an
effective Oracle is sought them
available and this is something that I
don't actually agree with and what we're
gonna see is that sometimes you have to
use some imagination but really there
are potentially quite a few Oracle's
available and almost always we can make
something work even if it's just a weak
Oracle like watching out for crashes so
what I'm gonna do is organize the
Oracles that are suitable for random
testing into a collection of categories
and so we're going to start off with we
coracles and weak Oracle's weak Oracle's
are some of the ones that are most
useful in practice but I'm calling them
weak because they can only enforce
fairly generic properties about the
software under test so the most
important weak Oracle is just detecting
whether or not the application crashed
what a crash usually really means is
that the system owner tests violated
some rule that the hardware imposed like
for example memory accesses have to be
aligned or that the operating system
opposed like for example the application
isn't allowed to try to write to memory
that's owned by the kernel and a
response to this violation the operating
system has decided to terminate the
process in which the software under test
is contained
so the second most useful be coracle is
violation of a programming language rule
so in Python if you try to access an
element of a list that's out of bounds
and if you don't catch the resulting
exception then your Python program will
get terminated that's an example of the
violation of a language rule killing an
application and serving as an Oracle
that tells us basically that something
went wrong and basically most any
programming language has a number of
rules like this and the stronger those
rules are the more effective of an
Oracle the programming language runtime
can serve as and one of the reasons why
C and C++ applications crashed so much
is because the language is an extremely
weak enforcer of runtime rules and so
basically all of the enforcement falls
upon the operating system and the
hardware itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
