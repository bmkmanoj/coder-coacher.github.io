our whole graph area look a little bit
cleaner since our x-values new trains
from negative 5 25 on this portion of
the axis that we've drawn each of these
grid lengths needs to count for one so
when we step from zero one step over we
need to label that one two three and so
on and you see we get to five on the
positive edge of the axis counting in
the negative direction we have the same
scale so we have negative 1 negative 2
and you can see I even made a mistake
when I was drawing these axes I made our
x-axis one longer than it needed to be
which doesn't really hurt us so I'm
going to leave it as is I apologize for
my lack of perfection here and when the
y direction we need to be able to go
from positive 10 all the way down to
negative 20 we have five boxes up here
and 10 boxes down here that means we
need to count by twos with each step of
the graph so maybe from 0 up one box is
going to actually be stepping to in the
Y direction and then down at the same
scale again now again the point of
creating these scales and these limited
lengths for either axis is really just
to make our lives easier a little bit
when we're graphing the x and y values
for this graph do extend actually all
the way from negative infinity to
positive infinity we're only going to
graph part of that infinitely long line
in particular the part that shows these
values on this graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
