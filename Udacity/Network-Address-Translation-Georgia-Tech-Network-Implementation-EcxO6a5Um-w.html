the same private IP address space let's
suppose that we have two networks these
networks might be for example homes or
they might be larger networks in regions
of the Internet where ipv4 address space
is scarce for example in developing
regions
what NAT allows these networks to do is
reuse the same portion of Internet
address space for example a particular
special private IP address space is one
92168 slash sixteen other private IP
address space is specified in RFC 3130
now obviously these two networks
couldn't coexist on the public internet
because routers wouldn't know if they
got a packet destined for an IP address
in this space which network the packet
should be sent to what a NAT or a
network address translator does is take
the private IP addresses that are behind
the NAT and translate those IP addresses
to a single globally visible IP address
now to the rest of the Internet network
one appears to be reachable by a single
IP address two zero three one seven
eight one dot one in network two is
reachable via a single distinct global
IP address one 33.4 1.5 now a host back
here say one nine two one six eight dot
one dot ten might send a packet towards
a global internet destination now the
key behind NAT is that this packet has a
source port and the NAT is basically
going to take that source IP address and
port and it's going to translate it into
a publicly reachable source IP address
and port and the destination will remain
the same that packet will make its way
to a global destination and the reply
will make its way to the globally
reachable IP address on the
corresponding port now in that packet
with that particular destination IP
address and port reaches the net the NAT
has a table that knows the mapping
between that public IP address and port
and the private one that it rewrote to
generate the corresponding public IP
address and port so it can simply now
rewrite the destination IP
of this packet to the corresponding
private address and port nets are
popular on broadband access networks
small or home offices and VPNs there's a
clear savings in ipv4 address space
since there can be many many devices in
one of these private networks and yet
all of the devices that are behind the
net only use up one public IP address
the drawback of course is at the
end-to-end model is broken and we talked
about the end-to-end model in a previous
lesson and let me just remind you how
NAT breaks it if the NAT device failed
in this instance for example the mapping
between the private source IP address
and port and the public source IP
address and port would be lost
thereby breaking all active connections
for which the NAT is on the path it's
also asymmetric under ordinary
circumstances it's rather difficult for
a host on the global Internet to reach a
device in a private address space in
network 1 or network 2 because by
default those devices in these private
networks do not have public globally
reachable IP addresses so not both
breaks end-to-end communication and it
also breaks bi-directional communication</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
