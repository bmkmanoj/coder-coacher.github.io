we want to separate out these tags from
the words that will be displayed on the
screen breaking up words like this is
actually a surprisingly common task in
real life for example ancient Latin was
often written or inscribed without
spaces in this particular set of letters
sonatas populist correo de manos is
inscribed on the arch of Titus which
I've doodled over here is a column but
what can you do arches are apparently
beyond my power I know it has just
become an arch those labels never lie
Roman inscriptions like this were
written without spaces and it requires a
bit of domain knowledge to know how to
break this up Senate and the people of
Rome that inscription was made quite
some time ago similarly in many written
asian languages they don't explicitly
include spaces or punctuation between
the various characters are glyphs in
this particular japanese example and
both my handwriting and my stroke order
are very very poor have pity some amount
of domain knowledge is required to break
up a no from yama that mountain finally
even if you're not familiar with asian
languages or ancient latin you might
have seen the same sort of thing in a
much more modern guys in text messaging
some amount of domain knowledge is
required to break this up into I love
you even though no particular spaces are
given so we will want to do the same
thing for HTML to break it up into words
like Wollstonecraft and wrote that will
appear on the screen or this special
left angle bracket slash maneuver that
tells us that we're starting and end tag
this special word in the middle that
tells us which tag it was and then this
closing right angle bracket so once
again for this HTML fragment we want to
break it up into this first word the
start of the closing tag another word
the end of the closing tag and then
another word we're going to need to do
this to write our web browser in order
to interpret HTML and JavaScript we're
going to have to break sentences down
into their component
words to figure out what's going on this
process is called dun da-dun lexical
analysis lexical here has the same route
as lexicon like a dictionary this means
to break something down into words and
you'll be pleased to note that we're
going to use regular expressions to
solve this problem so here I've written
another one of those decompositions we
might have broken an HTML fragment down
into these word like objects but this
time you're going to help me out by
doing the problem in Reverse so in this
multiple multiple choice quiz I'd like
you to mark each one of these HTML
fragments that would decompose into this
sequence of five elements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
