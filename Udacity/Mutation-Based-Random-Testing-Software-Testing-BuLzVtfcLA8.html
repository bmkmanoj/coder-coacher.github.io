and love of the input domain for some
software under test and if we think
about what the generative random tester
is gonna do what's probably really gonna
do is cluster them in some part because
it's very hard to cover the actual full
space of inputs but in any case they're
going to be spread out over some part of
the region what a mutation based random
tester is gonna do is start with some
known input and what its gonna do is
randomly modify it and so it's gonna end
up within two test cases that in some
sense are kind of in the same
neighborhood as the original input so
this is our mutation based random tester
is going to be able to access points
like this we start with a different
input it's gonna be able to get points
like this and so what's happening is
we're exploring interesting parts of the
input domain and it could be that we
could have never reached this part of
the input domain using any kind of a
generative random test case generator
that we have time to make so this
thethis approach is extremely useful an
extremely valid but on the other hand
it's generally limited to exploring sort
of a region of the input space that's
close to the starting point one thing
that you should be asking yourself right
now is what are the operators that we
use to mutate Frant to mutate test cases
to create new random test cases and so
let's look at that a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
