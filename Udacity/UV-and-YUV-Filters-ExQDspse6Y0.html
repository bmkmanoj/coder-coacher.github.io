filter the image cut off yuck all right
you know the first thing that happens is
you realize you've got all of these
white pixels why is that well because
they didn't have a huge amount of V but
they still had a reasonable amount of
that why all right so how would you
filter out these bright pixels well duh
you would just reduce the requirement on
the luminance we're not going to allow
all of the Y pixels anymore instead will
filter we might say well we're going to
allow the luminance of just I don't know
zero to 150 let's say and so that would
eliminate so here we are on the same
right that so that would capture all of
these pixels all right so now if we use
that right we include the Y value of
zero to 150 we get a much better
selection of the red pixels and this is
just to show you comparison that it's
just easier to do this on the in the y
UV space than the RGB space the only
reason this is easier is because we're
using boxes right because there's a
linear combination of RGB that'll give
you almost pure linen to give you y UV
if you could orient your boxes they
would end up being the same filter but
if you're trying to limit the boxes they
would be straightforward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
