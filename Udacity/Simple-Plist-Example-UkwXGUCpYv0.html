those concepts that take practice to
fully grasp and this playground i've
demonstrated some really practical
examples for using each but before we
look at the code let's take a look at
some plist and json files so i'm going
to go over here to the resources folder
and let's start by looking at the
students dot p list so if we look here
at the top we notice that this contains
an array and within the array we have
dictionaries
now for each dictionary we have key
value pairs representing some things
related to students so we have a key
name that maps to a string value in this
case the value is Sean we have an age
key that maps to a number value in this
case 57 and we have a school key that
map's to another string in this case the
University of Maryland
each of these dictionaries could easily
be converted into a simple struct that's
what this first code example does so
here at the top of the file we defined a
student struct with a name and age in
school these next lines of code are
critical this line here creates a path
represented as a URL that tells us where
the students pea list is located then
this next line of code takes that path
again that's represented as a URL and
loads it into an array and we're calling
this a student's array now some of the
code that's going on here you haven't
quite seen yet but you can probably make
sense of it it uses classes which are
similar to structs and they have their
own functions like URL for resource that
belong to them we'll get to classes
later for now I just want to focus on
the task at hand which is working with
plist and json data now another thing I
want to note is the reason that we're
loading this into an array instead of
maybe a dictionaries if we go back to
the plist file we can see here at the
top that the root of this plist file is
an array and not a dictionary so that's
key and the next lines of code we loop
through the students array and we check
for those key value pairs name age and
school and if each of those key value
pairs exists then we create a student
struct and we append it to our students
strokes array then at the bottom I have
this simple
use case where we print some information
about each student
now this printing is pretty trivial but
imagine if this student data was loaded
from the pilas fall into the students
trucks and then we displayed it in some
slick looking user interface that would
be pretty sweet and you'll start
building towards doing things like this
as you start building apps from scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
