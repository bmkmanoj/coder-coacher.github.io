applications with access to the
underlying hardware it does so by
exporting a number of services at the
most basic level these services are
directly linked to some of the
components of the hardware for instance
there is a scheduling component that's
responsible for controlling the access
to the CPU or maybe there even multiple
CPUs the memory manager is responsible
for allocating the underlying physical
memory to one or more qur'anic
applications and it also has to make
sure that multiple applications don't
overwrite each other's accesses to
memory a blog device driver is
responsible for access to a blog device
like disk in addition the operating
system also exports higher-level
services that are linked with higher
level abstractions as opposed to those
that are linked with abstractions that
really map to the hardware for instance
the file is a useful abstraction that
supported by virtually all operating
systems in principle operating systems
integrate filesystem as a service in
summary the operating system will have
to incorporate a number of services in
order to provide applications and
application developers with a number of
useful types of functionality this
includes Process Management file
management device management and so
forth operating systems make all these
services available via system calls for
examples here's some system calls in two
popular operating systems Windows and
UNIX I will not read through this list
but notice that although these are two
very different operating systems the
types of system calls and the
abstractions around those system calls
these two OSS provide are very similar
but process control creating a process
exiting a process waiting for objects
creating files etc</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
