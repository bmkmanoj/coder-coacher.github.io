have all our coordinates in the cameras
frame of reference what we now want to
do is to find a box in this space to
contain everything we're going to render
it's sort of like defining the size of a
stage as noted before the orthographic
cameras definition is to give a left
right top bottom near far set of values
to define this box these six numbers
define the corners of a rectangular box
in the view space of your camera the
first time I explained it we made a box
and then oriented it in space what's
happening as far as the matrices go is
the reverse we first orient the world to
the camera's view of things then define
our box with respect to the camera
in practical terms we usually make the
left and right be opposites along with
the top and bottom the near value is
often zero though can be any number the
idea is that the view matrix moved
everything in the world to be placed
relative to the lens of our camera
creating the orthographic camera itself
makes a projection matrix the Box
defined by the projection matrix is then
in front of the camera and symmetric
around its view axis this box called the
view volume in fact performs a
projection we're not just defining a box
we're saying take everything in this box
and project it onto the plus Z side of
the box
and make an image you may have been
wondering why are we looking down the
negative z-axis this is done because it
makes for a right-handed coordinate
system for the camera the Y Direction is
up exits to the right giving a Cartesian
coordinate system for the image formed
to keep things right-handed the z axis
must be pointing toward the viewer
meaning we have to look down the
negative z axis that said 3j s thinks
about the orthographic camera is going
in a positive direction so the far value
is specified as a distance along the
negative z axis our chain of matrices
adds this projection to the front in
other words the projection is applied
next when applied a coordinate will get
a new value in this projections frame of
reference this frame uses what are
called normalized device coordinates or
NDC for short these NDC coordinates are
in the range negative 1 to 1 for x y&amp;amp;z
we'll talk more about this transform in
a minute but the point is is that
whatever is inside the box will have
coordinates transform to this new range</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
