conformity social psychologists also
look at social factors that pressure us
to act in certain ways and here we're
talking about social norms now social
norms are rules of acceptable behavior
that are imposed on us by our culture
and norms actually vary by culture for
example maybe you can think of a social
norm that's specific to your culture for
example when I was younger I was living
and working in Tokyo and I was very
unfamiliar with the Japanese culture but
there was one social norm that I noticed
right away that was different from the
way I grew up and that was that the
Japanese kept their shoes outside of
their door perhaps you can think of some
social norms and talk about those on the
forum now what I realized later is that
the Japanese kept their shoes outside of
their house not only for practical
purpose such as keeping the house clean
but also for spiritual purposes but now
let's go back to Lauren and look a
little bit more specifically at
conformity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
