quite difficult though so let's look at
what you might have tried to do to
answer that question so let's do some
experiments so we'll try making a simple
set and we'll initialize a to be the
result of set 1 2 3 and now I can see
the value of a it's a set containing
those three elements the first kind of
experiment we want might do to figure
out if something is mutable is try and
assignment this is the kind of thing we
could do with a list if this was a list
assigning to index 0 would replace this
value in the set but when we try that
with a set what we do is get an error it
says that said object does not support
item assignment that might suggest that
set is immutable if we think of other
things that we've done that don't
support assignment when we had a string
we got the same error message and we got
that error message because the string
was immutable but just because it
doesn't support item assignment doesn't
mean there might not be another way to
change it let's think about other ways
we might change objects if we had a list
we could change it by doing a penned
that mutates the value of the list
adding a new element to the end of it
can we do that with a set well here's
our set again let's try if we can do
append to the set and we also get an
error message it doesn't have a way to
do append so experiments don't tell us
everything that we need to know at least
not these ones from these experiments
that looks like set may not be mutable
we haven't found a way to mutate it but
that's certainly not enough to conclude
that it's immutable so maybe we need to
do more than just these experiments and
let's look at what we can find by doing
our search again and see if we can learn
more about sets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
