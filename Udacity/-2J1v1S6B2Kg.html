highly related to the conservation of
area and phase space I'm going to
introduce that notion in a second solve
us that also conserve that area are
pretty good at conserving the energy not
exactly but almost exactly for
simplicity I'm looking at a one
dimensional system the position has one
dimension just a single number the
velocity has one dimension just a single
number phase space has the coordinates X
and V and physicists actually used the
momentum which is mass times velocity I
don't want you to be confused so I stick
to a velocity for every point in this
phase space we can look at its temporal
evolution given a value of x given a
value of V we can solve the system of
differential equations and something is
going to happen about that point and
another point and another point you
start from that initial condition the
given X the given V and look at what
happens to this X and that we and look
at what happens to position and velocity
the trick now is to look at infinitely
many initial conditions at the same time
a complete some area in phase space this
is what we are talking about let's look
at all of these initial conditions
what's going to happen with them where
is the evolution going where is the
differential equation taking us in this
way we see an evolution of area in phase
space this set of initial conditions
will after say one second end up here
and after another second maybe end up
here and so on and so on an area in
phase space remains constant
that's called Yuval theorem
why does the area in phase space stay
constant as it evolves let's look at the
first equation the position changes with
a rate of the velocity so
if you wait for a small time and look at
where we're ending expert increase a
little here increase more here more here
and so on depending on V and this motion
does not depend on X it just depends on
V so our initial area will be deformed
into this which is the same area simply
use this part glue it to that part and
you see that the blue parallelogram has
the same area as the purple rectangle so
the first equation alone would not
change the area if you look at the
second equation on its own the rate of
change of the velocity depends on X and
on X only so if this velocity is changed
by that much also this velocity will
change by that margin that velocity will
change by that much the rate of change
does not depend on V it just depends on
X so we could have a different rate of
change here but it has to be the same
for all velocities and maybe there's a
different rate of change here and again
it has to be the same for all velocities
so our purple rectangle is transformed
into something that may look like this
and that still has the same area as the
original purple rectangle head to see
that simply take this slice and push it
down and take this slice and push it
down and so on and so on so each
equation alone would not change the area
if it continuously applied these rates
of change together we also have no
problem fill it X evolved for an
infinitesimally short amount of time and
then we let V evolve for an
infinitesimally short amount of time and
then it's the turn of X again and so on
and so on that's going to work if we
apply the first equation for an
infinitesimal amount of time and then we
apply this second equation for an
infinitesimal amount of time the area
stays the same then we apply the first
equation again and so on and so on
if we step through this in
infinitesimally short
steps that's going to work the problem
is when we apply both equations at the
same time and do not use infinitesimally
short time steps then it's going to
break and that's precisely what the
forward Euler method does you can see
one solution to that problem you apply
the first one for a finite time step
then the second one for a finite time
step then the first one and the second
one and so on
one after the other that's going to work
that's going to conserve face space area
this leads to the conservation of that
area and solvers which have the same
property are called symplectic sometimes
people also use the terms geometric
integrators we are going to build the
simple most one of these and have a look
at the long term behavior and there's
something to note all of this works
because the force neither depends on
time nor on velocity if the force was
influenced by time or velocity that
would most probably break this nice
behavior homework one is going to show
the evolution of phase space in action
producing some nice diagrams</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
