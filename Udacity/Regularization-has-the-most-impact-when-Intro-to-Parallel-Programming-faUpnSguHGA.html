good case for regularization the load is
mostly evenly distributed so there is
some regular sort of average case that
you can shoot for that will be
relatively easy to predict and then
occasionally you'll have outliers and
you can do something about them such as
dealing with them separately and another
algorithm or on another processor as we
discussed before so i would consider
this a good case for regularization it's
likely that we can come up with a
regularization strategy here that'll
work on the other hand when the load
varies wildly and it's not really easy
to predict what is the average case you
have no idea when you start a process
how how long it's going to take or how
many items you'll have to process then I
would say this is not an easy case for
regularization which is really sort of
just restated in the final bullet
obviously for regularization the whole
goal is to is to extract regular
parallelism from irregular parallelism
and so for that point you'd kind of like
to be able to know what is regular so if
you can predict where and how load
imbalance is going to take place at
runtime then you can structure the
application to deal with the load
balancing on the spot so when load is
relatively evenly distributed it's
almost regular already and dealing
separately with occasional
irregularities is likely to work if the
load varies wildly then it's harder to
know what to regularize to and it's much
easier to regularize the workload if you
can predict what that workload is going
to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
