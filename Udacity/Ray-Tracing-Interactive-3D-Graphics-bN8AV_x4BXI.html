local illumination models where an
object is affected by a light and the
result is sent to the eye light comes
only from well light sources no light is
reflected from other objects there are
many more light paths that can be
tracked one rendering technique that can
simulate these is called ray tracing
we've seen how the GPU sends each object
triangle in turn to the screen and
rasterizes it ray tracing instead fires
rays from the eye through each pixel
objects are tested against each ray the
closest object found along Ray's path is
the one that's used to compute the Rays
color contribution you can think of each
ray from the eye as rendering a single
one by one pixel one way to find the
closest object for this pixel is to send
every triangle down the pipeline and
attempt to rasterize it using the Z
buffer to keep track of the closest
object this is perhaps the slowest way
ever to perform ray tracing in reality
researchers and practitioners have spent
huge amounts of time creating and tuning
algorithms to rapidly find this closest
object along the Ray where rasterization
gets some of its speed is from the fact
that a single triangle usually covers a
bunch of pixels various intermediate
results can then be shared when
processing the triangle at its simplest
ray tracing can give the same result as
rasterization each ray from the eye
finds the closest object along it the
effect of light on the surface is
computed and the result is displayed
however that's just the starting point
for ray tracing for the light to surface
paths we've made one obvious
simplification for basic rasterization
objects don't block other objects in
other words no shadows are cast in ray
tracing adding basic shadows is trivial
shoot a ray from the surface to the
light if there's something in the way
the light is blocked and can be ignored
since all computations happen in world
space we can avoid many of the precision
problems found in rasterization
techniques such as shadow mapping
classical ray tracing also offers us the
ability to create true reflections and
glass effects for shiny surfaces we can
spawn a new ray in the reflection
direction whatever this ray hits is what
is reflected in the surface and so can
be factored into the raids final color
its radiance let's say our sphere is
actually glass instead of simple
filtering we can also spawn a refraction
ray and see where it hits when it
encounters the other side of the sphere
and exits we spawn yet another
refraction ray in the reflection ray we
can continue to spawn Ray's until we hit
some limit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
