we start factoring we should remove the
greatest common factor first nine is the
greatest factor that goes into 9x
squared + 36 y squared so i can factor
that nine out of my expression and I'll
be left with x squared minus 4y squared
so the first term is a perfect square
since x squared equals x squared and the
second term is also a perfect square
since 2y squared is 4 y squared we can
factor this inside parentheses using a
plus B times a minus B when I write the
factored form I want to remember to keep
my GCF my greatest common factor that
stays on the outside of the other
parentheses so here's our factored
expression and in this case we have
three different factors one of them
being the GCF of these terms you might
have thought to factor this as 3x plus
6y times 3x minus 6y there's a common
factor of three in this term so we can
factor it out there's also a common
factor of three in these two terms so we
can factor a 3 out from this parentheses
as well so I have 3 times x plus 2y
times 3 times X minus 2y and we can
easily see by distributing we'd wind up
with these parentheses back from before
we know the order of multiplication
doesn't matter so I can just multiply
the 3 times 3 and then list my other two
factors this would have been another way
to get our same result if you want to
avoid removing common factors between
pairs of terms then it's best to factor
out the GCF first if we do that then we
won't need to do this in the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
