create some events inside of your
organization this doesn't require a lot
of permission seeking what this requires
is is really an understanding for the
problem some small-scale experiments to
try to solve the problem and then some
data that you can share and so I love
this because it uses the model in the
small you create a small event you have
some language around it are you deliver
that that event backed into your
organization and this will start to
affect the structure I guarantee you if
you lead with the language of change the
structure will not give way so it's very
very hard to get the kind of agency that
you that you need to do the whole thing
when you haven't started with even the
very basics so often times people feel
when it when I share this the first
response is oh man I've got it I got to
do something what I really want to do is
I want to convince people I want to get
them to change their attitude well
attitude changes is good but it's hard
and it's maybe the least effective in
terms of how we can change how we can
move behavior so my favorite example of
this is I wanted to become a marathon
runner so I went out and I bought the
shoes and i bought the outfit and and I
really developed this strong attitude
that I'm going to be awesome and then I
sat on the couch and I ate lucky charms
and I watched a lot of marathons in my
new shoes and my new running outfit what
changed was my attitude but what didn't
change was my behavior and so the event
helps to shape two things it provides
language to talk about it but it
actually gives us a vision of what good
looks like and it gets us started I
think it's BJ Fogg who talks about this
if you want to be a runner you need to
hire a running coach you might need
shoes to like you might need a cool
outfit that the first thing you do is
you need someone who's going to show up
at your house and take you running and I
think the same idea works inside the
organization find some small area of
improvement they
you that you can do do it and then share
that result with the organization I
wouldn't go big or broad and I wouldn't
spend a lot of time trying to convince</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
