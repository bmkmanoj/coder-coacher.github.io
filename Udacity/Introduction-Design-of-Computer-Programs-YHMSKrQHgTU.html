spread this lesson is going to be about
tools now we Homo sapiens fancy
ourselves as tool makers we think that's
what distinguishes us from the other
animals and in the physical world we've
invented lots of tools these general
ones like screwdrivers and pliers you're
probably very familiar with and some
very specific tools look at this one you
may not know what this does but look how
nicely it fits into my hand or look at
this one what do you think this one does
if somebody can tell me on the forum
what this one does I'll send them as
well prize or look at this one the
surgeons forceps now these have been
refined over the years and now we can
refine them to the point where they
serve as a as a third hand it's got this
trick where I can attach it on and now I
don't have to put my hand on it anymore
because it's got a little locking
mechanism so our tools get better and
better over time now there's a saying
that a poor craftsman blames his tools
and I was thought that all that meant
was he shouldn't complain you shouldn't
whine but I realized it means more than
that it means that the tools become a
part of you and if you're a good
craftsman then the tools are a part of
you and you know what to do with them
and so you're not going to end up
blaming your tools and that's what we're
going to learn in this lesson about
software tools we're going to learn
about some general software tools about
some very specific software tools and
specifically we're going to talk about
two we're going to talk about first
language now language is perhaps Homo
sapiens greatest invention our greatest
tool and in computer programming well a
computer program is written in a
language but a computer program can also
employ language as a tool to do its job
the other tool we're going to talk about
his functions of course you've been
using functions all along but we're
going to talk about new techniques for
using functions and learn why they're
more general and malleable than other
tools so see you in the lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
