that the first example of recognizing
someone's picture from a bunch of tagged
photographs is definitely a supervised
classification example this is something
that Facebook does all the time when it
does recognition on the photos that you
upload there another popular one is
recommender systems like Netflix and
Pandora they look at the stuff that they
know that you like already and they try
to figure out what the features of of
those things are those movies or those
songs and it recommends more movies or
songs that have similar features to you
fraud is probably not an example of
supervised classification and that's
because we haven't really defined what a
weird-looking transaction is we don't
have an example of what that might mean
so there's ways that you could still do
this but this would be an example of
unsupervised learning and we'll talk
about that a little bit more later in
the class
another thing that's usually
unsupervised learning is clustering so
in this example we don't know what the
types of students are we might not even
know how many different types were
looking for there's still ways that we
can approach this problem but this isn't
an example where you have a big bank of
training data where you already know the
correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
