means you decided that you are ready to
take this course and in which case i'll
say it again welcome to educational
technology i'm really glad to have you
here but before we get started with this
course there's something that's very
important to understand this is a course
about educational technology but it's
also very much an experiment in
educational technology I know about the
courses online that have a lot of
discussions or are built around projects
but I don't know of any that go quite as
far as we're going to go this is really
an experiment to see what educational
technology can do we're going to try
some things in this course that will
fail miserably we're also going to try
some things that work out really well
and that we should implement in other
courses going forward part of your role
as a student in this course is to give
us feedback on that what's working
what's not what should we fix in which
we carry on into other courses that's
part of your participation in this class
the learning goals of this class or to
learn about what educational technology
can do and so you need to give us
feedback on what educational technology
is doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
