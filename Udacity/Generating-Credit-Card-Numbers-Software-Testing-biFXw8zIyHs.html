this input validity problem let's works
towards a situation which is going to
lead towards a programming problem for
you where you have to solve this kind of
problem and a specific problem that
right to look at is generating valid
credit card numbers and so you might ask
the question why would we care about
generating valid credit card numbers and
the assumption here is that you are
working on some software under test
whose input domain is valid credit card
numbers and so your sis your software
under test it's probably doing something
like processing payments and its output
is going to be something like completed
transactions so now how are you going to
test this well one thing you're going to
do is collect some credit cards that you
have and that your friends have and so
you'll have a variety of MasterCard and
American Express and other kinds of
credit cards you're going to run it
through your payment processing system
and you're going to see if it works
after you finish doing about the
question you have to ask is have you
shakin all the bugs out of your code and
the answer is probably not so we're
going to want to do is randomly generate
valid credit card numbers and use that
to test the payment processing system
and so to get a new farther here what
we're going to have to do is take a look
at the structure of a credit card number
so here's how those work so there's some
number of some number of digits at the
start of a credit card number so let's
say six the constitute the issuer
identifier what this means is that for
example all of the American Express
cards issued by a certain company are
going to share an issuer identifier the
next set of digits let's say eight of
them is going to correspond to the
account number for this credit card and
then finally at the end or a check digit
and this is computed algorithmically
from the preceding numbers and the
function of the check digit is to serve
as a validity check for a credit card
number so if I if I'm entering my credit
card into a website or if I'm swiping my
credit card and the magnetic strip has
gotten corrupted it's fairly likely that
if any of these digits are wrong the
check digit is going to catch it and the
the credit card number can be rejected
rapidly and algorithmically rather than
actually having to submit this thing to
somebody who can process the payments
and forcing them to reject it when the
account number or the issuer identifier
fails to look up correctly and so the
check digit is computed using something
called Lunz algorithm so this fellow
loan was a guy who worked for IBM during
the middle part of the 20th century and
in 1960 he patented Lunz algorithm which
is simply a method for calculating this
check digit it's been used ever since in
applications like this let's look at how
to use Lunz algorithm to calculate a
check digit so what we're going to have
is a sequence of numbers and this will
work for any number and other two cases
if there's an odd number of digits we're
going to do one thing and if there's an
even number they'll be a slight
variation if there's an odd number of
digits we're going to do is
go through the digits and take every
even-numbered digit and multiply it
times two so the odd digits we're going
to leave alone and the even ones we're
going to multiply times two the next
thing we're going to have to do is see
if any of the resulting numbers are
greater than nine if so we're going to
subtract nine and some so some numbers
going to result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
