unconsciousness coma for instance in
fact the coma is brain activity so
you're not dead but it's just one step
up from being dead
for instance my brother back in the 90s
was involved in a very serious accident
he was riding his bike home from work
and a woman who's driving a car turned
right into him didn't see him and he hit
the windshield he went into a serious
coma very deep coma for two weeks and
then for about six months
he was vegetative his eyes would open
but he was still really quite
non-responsive so during this time he
went from near-death to a very gradual
awakening of consciousness in fact I
kept wondering what was he aware of was
he aware of anything could he hear his
could he think could he remember we just
didn't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
