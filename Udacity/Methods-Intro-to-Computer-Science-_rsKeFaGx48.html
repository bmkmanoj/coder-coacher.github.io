we did here works okay but it doesn't
really give us what we wanted with types
we want types to be generally useful we
don't want to have to manually add all
the attributes every time we create a
new instance we want them really to be
part of the type so the way to do this
is to add code to the class definition
itself remember we define the class and
defining a method is just like defining
a procedure the difference is it's done
inside a class this syntax is the same
so let's try moving our display
restaurant procedure into the restaurant
class so here's what we had before we've
just moved this inside the class so now
it's indented as a block inside the
class I'm going to make one change to it
since now it's inside the restaurant
class we don't really need to have the
name restaurant as part of it so I'm
going to remove the restaurant there and
I'm going to also add a doc string as
just good programming practice that all
display does is print out some
information about the restaurant so now
let's try that and we're going to
actually be in for a surprise turns out
it's actually quite a pleasant surprise
but let's see if you can follow along
what happens so let's try that and we
can see that there is a display
attribute that was defined as part of
the restaurant object because this
definition inside the class and we can
see what it is is a method doesn't tell
us too much about the method but it is a
method and let's try and call it and it
takes one input will pass in McDowell's
we're going to see that we didn't
actually want to do that so here's what
happens that we actually get an error
and the error we get is that it says it
takes exactly one argument but there
were two given hmm I don't see two
arguments I only see one well this is a
shortcut that we get with methods and
the shortcut we get is the first
argument is actually this one it's the
one before the name of the method so
here's what's going on here if we have
an object followed by a dot followed by
an attribute which is the method and we
pass in parameters what that really
means is that we're calling this method
with the first parameter already bound
to this object so there's a little bit
of magic which is that the parameter
already bound to the object but
otherwise is just like a normal
procedure call so let's look more
closely at what the value of the
McDowell's display attribute is it's a
bound method and that means it's already
got its first input bound and it's bound
to the object that was created so this
is the restaurant object if we look at
McDowell's that's exactly the object
that it's bound to these values here
don't really mean anything other than
that they allow us to uniquely identify
objects so we can see that it's bounded
the same object as the name McDowell's
is and now if we call it we only need to
pass in no parameters since the first
parameter is the one that's already
bound and now we still get an error we
get an attribute error because our
object has no name attribute we need to
give it one and now when we call the
display method we add an attribute to
this object we didn't change the objects
so display is still bound to the same
object we created which now has a name
attribute and now display prints out
