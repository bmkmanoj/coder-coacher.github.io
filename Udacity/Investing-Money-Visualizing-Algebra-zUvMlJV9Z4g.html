equations using substitution and
elimination let's see how we can use
those skills to solve some more
interesting problems let's try one with
interest you invest $10,000 in two funds
one of the funds pays at seven point
five percent and another Fund pays at
eight percent you earned a total
interest of seven hundred and
eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents so
how much money did you invest at each
rate maybe you lost your tax forms or
maybe you don't have your bank
statements either way you can use
algebra to help figure out how much
money you invested at each rate when
creating a system of equations we know
that we need two variables x and y this
question actually indicates what
variables we should use we're looking
for how much money was invested at seven
point five percent and at eight percent
so that's going to be our two variables
I'm going to go ahead and let X be the
amount we invest at seven point five
percent and why be the amount we invest
at eight percent using these two
variables what equation could you write
involving the amount of money you
invested you want to use an amount plus
an amount should equal your total amount
write that equation here and remember it
should involve x and y</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
