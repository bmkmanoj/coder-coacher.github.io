at Udacity I started working on the
Udacity app for a deadline we had of
shipping the app the day of Google i/o
and so I joined the company about five
weeks or so before we had to ship and so
moved mountain view and work late and
shipped the app with a small team the
way I familiarize myself with the
codebase was really more getting
acquainted with the Udacity api's more
than the Android code most of the
Android code is pretty straightforward
in terms of Android development but the
way in which you fetch data from Udacity
it was quite different and so that's
where there was a bit of a learning
curve the activities in the Udacity app
are pretty straight for they're grouped
of course logically by the activity you
normally do on the site or in the
classroom so we have the notion of a
catalog for instance we have individual
details for courses and those are their
own activities same thing for our
authentication you have activities for
authentication or viewing your
enrollments pretty much everything you
can map to an activity that you do in
the Udacity classroom map student
activity and Udacity yeah so we use
intents throughout the app pretty much
everywhere so whenever you transition
between like let's say login to the
catalog or to your enrollments those are
all using explicit intents so it's
saying specifically I know I want to
transition from this activity to the
next one and these are maybe arguments
or additional parameters can be useful
when loading that new state so we use
very few implicit intents in the app
just because of the nature of it we
don't really have a lot of dependencies
on like I don't have to scan a barcode
or take a picture or things that would
have a dependency outside of myself
there is one place so that we use
implicit intents and it's for sending
support emails so if you're having an
issue with the app or you have an issue
with your account or app of course
there's no what email client you use or
how you how to send an email so we use
an implicit intent to generate that
response so you can send a support
ticket when I want to make a button
interactive for my layout of course when
you have in your activity I would have
to find the view that maps to that
button and then once I find it I can set
a listener a click listener on it so
that I can take a specific action on it
if I want to so that could be firing
maybe a new activity or that could be
performing a network whole like
enrolling a student and of course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
