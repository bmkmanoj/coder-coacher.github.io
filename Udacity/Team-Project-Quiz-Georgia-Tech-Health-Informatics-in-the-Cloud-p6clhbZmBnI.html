as you'll learn later on kearny hrs are
typically deficient in the ways they
collect and display clinical data
although we'll discuss some innovative
approaches to data capture the
visualization challenge is still largely
unsolved the team project is your
opportunity to solve it your four-person
team will develop an approach and submit
it for review you will then develop a
web app based on that approach and
submit it along with a short paper
describing your thinking and what you
feel you've achieved the projects will
be evaluated and graded by the target
end user actual physicians it will be
due at the end of the course and will
count for half your grade will ask each
of you for some background data so we
can assemble four-person teams with the
right mix of skills I'm telling you
about the project now and suggesting how
you can begin to do some reading to
familiarize yourself with current
thinking and work please don't wait
until later to start doing this while
this project may appear to be simple to
some of you I can assure you that it is
in fact quite challenging doing it well
will require careful thought analysis
and design as well as coding skills the
sooner you start the better you will do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
