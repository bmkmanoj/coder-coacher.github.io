we know the truth values of various
predicates in a sentence then we can
compute the truth value of the sentence
as a whole but a sentence may contain an
implication so that raises a question
how can we compute the truth value of an
implication this table gives us a truth
value of implications a and B are
predicates and here is a implies B to
see the truth value of a and B note that
when a is true and B is true then we
understand a implies B is true this is
as usual when a is true and B is false
this implication cannot be true so this
is false and if a is false then it
doesn't matter with the bees true or
false this will be implication will be
trivially true so it can be a little bit
weird to talk about the truth value of
an implication sentence what we're
really saying here is whether or not
this implication actually holds true so
let's take three different implications
to see this first let's think of the
implication feathers implies bird all
birds have feathers and only birds have
feathers so we know that if an animal
has feathers then it is a bird that's
true on the other hand let's take the
implication if scales then bird lots of
animals with scales aren't birds and in
fact no animals with scales or birds so
the implication scales implies birds
would be false for a third example let's
take the implication flight implies bird
if we have a penguin flight is false but
the penguin is still a bird so flight
can be false and bird can still be true
meaning the implication can still be
true here on the other hand if we have a
cat flight is false and bird is faults
so the implication you can still be true
so in this case if flight was false we
can't actually make a determination on
whether or not the animal is a bird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
