powerful tools they will empower you to
build complicated projects with ease
they also help teams to get up and
running quickly all while maintaining
code consistency and quality before we
begin I do want to stress two things
first is that we'll be taking a deep
dive into some pretty advanced
JavaScript language features and
programming concepts this course builds
on web tooling and automation JavaScript
design patterns and object-oriented
JavaScript to really get the most out of
the material make sure you're
comfortable with these topics discuss in
these courses check in the instructor
notes for links to these courses most
importantly make sure you're comfortable
working with JavaScript objects
especially how prototypal inheritance
works functions how lexical scope works
enclosures with a data hiding
capabilities that they provide the
second thing I want to stress is the
importance of both watching and working
along with me throughout the course
don't just sit back and watch the videos
but take an active role walk through the
code with me and make sure you actually
temp the quizzes and challenges yourself
if you stick with it and carefully work
through the code I know you'll come out
with skills you can really be proud of
this is a challenging course so if you
feel like you're starting to get
overwhelmed in some of the videos stop
seriously sometimes all it takes or
something to just click is just to take
a break go for a walk around the block
do something totally different to clear
your head while I was making this course
it felt like I walked around the block
every single day so ready to get going
