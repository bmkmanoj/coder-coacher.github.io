mind I have to decide what variable I'm
going to use for the angle I'm going to
let a equal the measure of the angle
next I have to remember what supplement
and complement mean if you recall the
supplement of an angle I'll write it as
s is equal to 180 minus the measure of
the angle so here we have the supplement
is 180 minus the measure of the angle
the other thing we have to remember is
complement the complement of an angle is
90 degrees minus the measure of the
angle so I have the measure of the angle
as a the supplement is 180 minus a and
the compliment is 90 minus a now we can
try to turn the words into an equation
the supplement of the angle s measures
which means equals 30 degrees more so
that's 30 plus twice its complement I
know that s equals 180 minus a and I
know that the compliment is 90 minus a
now I can solve this equation for a the
first thing I need to do to solve this
equation is to distribute this 2 so I
have 180 minus a equals 30 plus 2 x 90
is 180 and 2 times negative a is
negative 28 the next thing I want to do
is combine these like terms 180 plus 30
is 210 I need to get all my variables
onto one side of the equation and I'm
going to do that by adding to a to both
sides of the equation when I add to a to
both sides of the equation the left side
I have 180 negative a plus 2a gives me a
and that's going to equal to 10 the next
thing I need to do is subtract 180 from
both sides and i get a equals 2 10 minus
180 which gives me 30 so the measure of
an angle whose supplement measures 30
degrees more than twice its complement
is 30 degrees I think we've had enough
of word problems for now let's move on
to something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
