navigating by landmark html5 introduced
some new elements which help us to find
the semantics of a region of the page
rather than of a single interactive
element these are main this represents
the main content of a page typically
there should only be one main element
since otherwise it raises the question
of which one is really the main main
header this is either a page banner like
it is here or else a grouping element
for any introductory content at the
start of any type of section photo
similarly a footer may be either a page
footer as it is here and contain
information about the page or site or
maybe your footer to a particular
section of a page with extra information
about that section nav this represents a
section of a page that links to other
pages like the top nav bar auto parts
within the page like a table of contents
article this is for self-contained
sections of content like a blog entry
news article or forum post a handy test
for an article is whether its content
would make sense in another context such
a cross posting a blog post to several
different blogs section this is a
completely generic section of a document
or application since it doesn't really
give much of a clue as to what is
content might be we typically include a
heading inside as well and aside an
aside to represent any content which is
tangentially related to the content
around it in the context of an article
like this one this might be a little
pull out or sidebar or in the context of
a page it might be a page sidebar
containing some extra navigation or
information about the page an aside will
often be rendered as a sidebar but for
example in our responsive layout you
might fill an aside below the main
content for small viewport sizes there's
a very good chance that your stylesheet
already contains classes like header
navigation and so on for example you've
got a header section which has a
particular color theme and a bottom
border to delineate it from the rest of
your site and you might want links in
your navigation section to look
different for links in the rest of the
site using semantic elements
provides a more terse way to express the
same information while also potentially
providing more information for
screenreader users while these elements
don't have any default styling beyond
just having display block by default you
can use your site stylesheet just as you
would for a class name to select for
these elements to make them fit your
site's design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
