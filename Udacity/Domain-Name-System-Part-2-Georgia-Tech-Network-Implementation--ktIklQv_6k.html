see can be rather slow a particular DNS
query might thus require round trips to
multiple servers that are authoritative
for different parts of the hierarchy the
blue server is authoritative for the
route the purple server is authoritative
for dot edu and the red server is
authoritative for got apdu now supposing
we wanted to save the extra time and
trouble of these round-trip times this
local resolver would typically have a
cache it stores the NS records for each
level of the hierarchy as well as the a
records and each of these answers would
be stored or cached for a particular
amount of time each one of these replies
has what's called a time to live or a
TTL that indicates how long each of
these answers can be saved before they
need to be looked up again caching
allows for quick responses from the
local DNS resolver especially for
repeated mappings for example since
everyone is probably looking up domain
names such as google.com it's much
faster to keep the answer in cache so
given multiple clients trying to resolve
the same domain name the answers can all
be resolved in a local cache some
queries can reuse parts of this lookup
for example it's unlikely that the
authoritative nameserver for the root is
going to change very often so that
answer might be kept or cached for a
much longer period of time a typical
time might be hours or days or even
weeks the mapping for a local name such
as wwg edu on the other hand might
change more frequently and thus these
local TTLs
might need to be smaller now the most
common type of DNS record is what's
called an a record which Maps an IP
address to a domain name but there are
other important record types as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
