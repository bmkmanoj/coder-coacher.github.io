dictionary as our cache we're going to
use a and B as the key to this cache so
I just made a variable here called key
which is just a couple of a and B and in
Python you can use the tupple as a key
in a hash table
not all hash tables work this way but
the dictionary is built into Python how
am I really convenient so the first
thing we do is we say if key in cache
and if so R equals cache key which
basically looks up that value in the in
our cache if it's not in the cache we
run complex computation we set cache key
key to equal R and then we return R so
let's see how this this runs okay so if
I were to call cached computation of the
inputs 5 and 3 we see the value 8 prints
out ok and it pause for half a second
but you'll just have to believe me
let's let's add some extra information
here so we can see how long it's taking
to run ok the first thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to store in a variable
called start time the current time if
you call time time using the time
library here this will return the
current time in seconds that's just our
starting point and then we'll actually
print our cast computation like we did
before and then I'll print how long it
took to compute that and so I'm doing
here as I say print and I'm printing the
string the first computation took % F
seconds % F is just like percent s
except it's will print a number
formatted a little bit better and I'm
going to print the current time minus
the start time which will basically give
us how many seconds this this
computation took the run so let's give
this a run ok and we see the first
computation took just over half a second
and that makes sense because we sleep
for half a second and otherwise we're
just adding two numbers which doesn't
take very long at all let's go ahead and
run this a second time and see what
happens if we run it twice in a row ok
so I just copied and pasted these lines
and we're going to run them the second
time so we're gonna restart the start
time and then we're going to run the
same computation again with different
numbers and we're gonna print how long
it took to run so let's give this a run
ok so now we see we printed out two
things print out the result both times
the first time the computation took 0.5
seconds and the second time when we had
a cache hit when we ran through this
piece of code here the computation took
point 0 0 0 0 1 1 second
which is substantially faster so if we
had to run this computation a lot let's
say we're returning the front page of
ASCII Chan and we didn't want to do that
database query over and over again and
we cashed in we could get a substantial
speed improvement now who knows how long
it takes to actually run to the front
page of ASCII Chan we'll get to that in
a little bit but this is this is the a
general algorithm and you should get
familiar with you know this algorithm
because you'll be using it a lot you
know there's lots of different ways you
can cache things lots of different types
of caches and all sorts of things but
the algorithm is always the same check
to see if something's in the cache if it
is return it otherwise compute it store
it return it so good job if you got that
and let's move along to a real-world
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
