operators do this is actually doubling Y
by moving at one position to the left in
binary this is having Y or rounding down
and having Y for X and you may recall
that this percent sign is the modulus
operator so what this is saying is take
X divide it by 2 and tell me what the
remainder is if it's 1 then do this so
what does it mean for a remainder to be
1 it means that it's an odd number so
whenever X is odd it adds Y to Z then no
matter what it doubles Y halves X and
goes back to the loop and continues
doing this until X is 0 so unless this
is obvious to you this may seem a little
bit magical again why would this
actually be equivalent to naive why
would this actually be computing
multiplication let's just make sure that
it does first let's print Russian of oh
I don't know 14 comma 11 we'll run that
see what it gives us 154 all right so
that is in fact 14 times 11 but we're
gonna need to step through and try to
understand why that works out the way
that it does so if we give Russian the
input 14 comma 11 it's going to assign
these two X&amp;amp;Y and start off Z at 0 so
let's take a look at that now it's going
to go through the while loop and on each
iteration it's going to check to see
whether X is odd or even and if it's odd
then it's going to add Y to Z so we
start off at 14 which is not odd so what
does it tell us to do it tells us to
double Y and have X so we get down to 7
22 so Z remains 0 now that we the next
time through we see that X is odd so we
add y into Z mixed into 22 we have X and
double Y and in this case having and
rounding down so that gets us a 3 and a
44 so the next time through the while
loop we see that X is 3 which is odd so
that tells us to add 44 into Z giving it
a total of 66 then we have X rounding
down and double Y go back up to the top
of the while loop we see X is odd again
so we add y into Z then we have X
rounding down and double Y at which
point X becomes 0 and it returns the
value of Z which lo and behold is 154 so
it seems to have done the right thing
what we've really done here is we've
added several values of Y each of the
times as X is counting down each of the
times X becomes odd we add those
together so ends up being the sum of
those three numbers so you have to admit
that's kind of cool right it's somehow
doing the equivalent of we're
10 times 11 but not the way we would
normally do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
