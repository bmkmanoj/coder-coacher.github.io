we'll talk about the greedy approach
what I'm showing you here is the state
of the routing table at the source node
which is 14 and the key that I'm looking
for let's say is for and therefore in
the greedy approach I would assume that
the key K that is K being for will be
stored at a destination whose node ID is
for and what this table is showing is
the routing table at the source and in
particular the entries that you have
here where you have a valid entry those
are the nodes that are reachable from
node 14 so from the source node 14 I
know how to reach node number 13 I know
how to reach node number three I know
how to reach node number 20 and 5 I
don't know yet how to reach node number
four because that's not in my routing
table at this point of time the
inclusion in the greedy approach is if
I'm looking for a particular key K in
this case k is for then I know that the
node that is likely to have that key K
in this case for is going to be the node
whose ID is also 4 and so this is my
desired destination but what I'm going
to do in the greedy approaches get asked
close to the desired destination in the
load ID namespace if I look at the state
of my routing table I don't know how to
get to 4 which is my desired destination
but I know how to get 25 which is close
to the desired destination in the
namespace of the node IDs so what I'm
going to do is ask this guy because I
know how to reach him and he's close to
my desired destination do you have a way
of getting to destination number 4 and
my hope is that he may know the route to
get me to the desired destination and
I'll be done in getting the key value
pair that I'm looking for that's the
idea in greedy routing take the minimum
number of hops to get to the desired
definition by using information that is
available in my user level routing table
that has information about which are the
nodes that are reachable from me
directly so the objective in the greedy
approach to routing is reaching the
destination with the fewest number of
hops that's the key so in other words
I'm optimizing my own look up this me
first approach we know can lead to
congestion in particular the tree
saturation that I mentioned earlier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
