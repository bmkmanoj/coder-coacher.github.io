a bunch of triangles so if we let each
side length or each of these distances
that we're looking for be the hypotenuse
of a right triangle then we can as we've
done so many times before use the
Pythagorean theorem to find the length
of that side conveniently since we're
using graph paper made up of these
little tiny squares we have right angles
all over the place that made drawing
these right triangles super simple if
you look at the opposite ends of one of
these side lengths we can just draw
lines along the lines that already given
to us by the graph paper until intersect
to help us form the right triangle then
we just need to figure out the length of
each of these legs for each of these
triangles let's look at like a bee as an
example for how to deal with the other
three triangles on here we need to find
out the length of either of the two
shorter legs in order to find out the
hypotenuse so we could just count one
two three four five six seven seven is
the length of this side do the same
thing for this side this is five and
looking at this modified version of the
Pythagorean theorem we can just say that
the length of a B this hypotenuse is the
square root of seven squared plus 5
squared simplifying that gives us the
square root of 74 once we find the
lengths of the legs of all the other
right triangles calculating their
hypotenuse is also easy and so a long
last here are our final answers the
length of a B is the square root of 74
bc square root of 180 CD is the square
root of 40 and DA is the square root of
130</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
