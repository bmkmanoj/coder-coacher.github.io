example of two quantities that we could
very easily relate to one another with
an equation where one of the quantities
depends on the other quantity and think
about the relationship between those two
variables a little bit more so let's say
that we have a candy machine for which
there is a set price for candy so if I
put one kind of coin in the candy
machine it gives me a certain amount of
candy so in this case the input is the
amount of money that you put into the
candy machine just like for Athena with
her soda machine the input was the money
that she put into the soda machine and
the output here is the amount of candy
that comes out of the machine just like
the number of sodas was the output for
Athena earlier so which these two
statements do you think makes the most
sense for a given amount of money put in
there's more than one possibility for
the amount of candy that the machine
will dispense or for a given amount of
money put in there is at most one
possibility for the amount of candy that
the machine will dispense think about
how this machine works and how you think
that input and output should be related
to each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
