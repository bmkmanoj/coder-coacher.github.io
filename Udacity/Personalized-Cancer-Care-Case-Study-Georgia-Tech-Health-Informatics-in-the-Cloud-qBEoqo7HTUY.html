more complex family of diseases than
previously thought and that the results
of treatment in any individual patient
depends on their particular genomic
proteomic and metabolic pathways other
personal factors and on similar factors
in the cancer given the high mutation
rate in cancers there's usually more
than one cell type essentially more than
one cancer in each patient traditional
chemotherapy is a metabolic poison that
selectively targets rapidly growing
cells and works because cancer cells
divide more rapidly than normal cells
however our bone marrow hair cells and
the lining of the GI tract also grow
rapidly and are attacked by the
treatments leading to side effects that
can be awful more recently we've
developed mechanistic treatments that
have far fewer side effects because they
selectively attack metabolic pathways in
the cancer if it has the specific
pathway that the treatment targets these
are very expensive treatments and
precious time is lost if they don't work
without an analytic tool it's hard to
know which patients will benefit from a
therapy this research was aimed at
developing a predictive model to assist
physicians and selecting the right
mechanistic drug for each patient it's
based on a comprehensive model of known
cancer biochemical pathways a small part
of which is shown here the blue boxes
are the components and the red circles
are their reactions with each other the
researchers report then when genomic
data from the patient and from the
primary cell types in their cancer
including cancer stem cells if possible
are fed the model has successfully
predicted the efficacy of treatment it's
now being commercialized biol akris a
startup company in Germany where the
research was done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
