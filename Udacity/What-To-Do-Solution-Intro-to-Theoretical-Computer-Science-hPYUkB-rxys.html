immediately are viable options depending
on the situation so it's always a good
idea to do research on the problem that
you're working on because many problems
that occur in practice have occurred
elsewhere before so it's likely that
there will be some research on this
problem and that can help you a lot
potentially of course you can also try
to show and P completeness for your
problem because if you manage to show
this then you know your problem is going
to be hard this is not an excuse to give
up right away but you basically just
know what you're dealing with it's
always a good idea to discuss the
problem you're working on with friends
and experts of course because they might
have a new insight that helps you and
finally settling for a suboptimal
algorithm and we're going to talk more
about this in later units can sometimes
also be a good option if the stakes
aren't high so for example Alice working
on vertex cover if her company is happy
with installing a few more monitoring
devices than the absolute minimum then
she can possibly find another algorithm
or just maybe even solve it by hand if
she wants to in this unit we're going to
focus on this aspect here showing you
how you can prove NP completeness for a
problem we have already done this a
couple of times but it's worth to
practice this technique and then how you
can do some research on your problem so
I'll give you some example problems that
often occur in practice so that you know
the names and when you come across them
then you'll have an easier time to find
out more about the problem that you're
trying to solve</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
