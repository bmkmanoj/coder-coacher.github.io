integration testing and system testing
is a testing technique called
differential testing and a differential
testing what we're doing is taking the
same test input delivering it to two
different implementations of the
software under test and comparing them
for equality differential justice is
extremely powerful in the case where we
have multiple versions stress testing is
a kind of testing where a system is
tested at or beyond its normal usage
limits and is probably best described
through a couple of examples so for
example with a square root function that
we were talking about earlier we might
test it with very large numbers or very
tiny numbers for an operating system we
might test it by making a huge number of
system calls or by making very large
memory allocations or by creating
extremely large files for web server we
could stress test it by making many
requests or even better by making many
requests all of which require the
database to communicate with its
back-end stress testing is typically
done to assess the robustness and
reliability of the software under test
and finally we have what might be my
favorite kind of testing random testing
so in random testing we use the results
of a pseudo-random number generator to
randomly create test inputs and we
deliver those to the system under test
and sometimes we're just feeding raw
random bits to the software under test
but very often this can be much more
subtle and more sophisticated than just
throwing random bits at the software and
random testing is very often useful for
finding corner cases in software systems
and the crash me program for Linux and
other UNIX kernels that we talked about
earlier is a great example of a random
tester and we'll talk about more
examples later on in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
