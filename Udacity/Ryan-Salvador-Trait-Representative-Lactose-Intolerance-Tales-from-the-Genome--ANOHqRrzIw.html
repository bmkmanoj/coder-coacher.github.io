but I'm from Maryland and I am lactose
intolerant for everybody out there who
doesn't know what lactose intolerance is
tell us briefly what being lactose
intolerant means and briefly it means I
can't have milk or other dairy products
without experiencing some discomfort I
say discomfort and can you elaborate a
little bit under discomfort typically
mean its digestive discomfort so it's
gas bloating diarrhea that sort of thing
is anyone else in your family lactose
intolerant yes my younger sister is but
I have a brother who is not and my
parents or not okay um so do you do you
have any experience with this being a
genetic trait like dude does this run in
your family being lactose intolerant I
actually don't know because most of my
family lives in the philippines and they
don't drink cow milk they have the they
drink powdered milk and all this and not
dairy products because it's not as
popular there so it wasn't until I
discovered I was lactose intolerant that
I learned anything about it and when did
you discover that you're lactose
intolerant I would say that would be
about two or three years ago so really
that late in life on yes but they when I
found out I was lactose intolerant it
kind of explained some things from when
I was younger because there are times
like when I would have dairy products
and I'd be fine but then there's times
if I had too much at felt I felt a
little gassy but when I discovered I was
lactose intolerant it kind of made sense
that if I was young and overloaded on it
it made sense that then I would feel
discomfort I see so when you were young
though you felt like you could have
normal amounts and you were okay right
it wasn't until graduate school until
yeah about two years ago that I
discovered I was lactose intolerant and
I think it's because that's when it kind
of just when it really kind of shut off
right right how did that make you feel
to sort of discovered this about
yourself well like I said it kind of
made sense to me because it explained a
lot of things about why I'd randomly
feel sick some days and why wouldn't
other days and just depended on
breakfast but it was kind of annoying to
find out mostly because I knew it would
have to I'd have to either change my
diet or write other things so what are
the kinds of foods you actually
to avoid if you are lactose intolerant
person if you're lactose intolerant and
you're not taking any type of supplement
then you basically have to avoid
anything that has an appreciable amount
of dairy products in it so obviously I'm
not going to be drinking straight milk
ice cream pizzas with a lot of cheese on
it taco tacos American style tacos
burritos all those things cake
cheesecake so what you're saying is that
there's a lot of food restrictions yes
it is a there's a lot a huge part of the
diet that is has dairy products in it
and so discovering the octos atomic
eynde of makes it more difficult to get
that sorted so do you find yourself in
situations I guess social situations
where you see if food come out you're
like oh gosh you really want that and
you're like oh gosh I can't eat it yes
especially I do ok I do try to carry
around lactase pills lactase enzyme
pills but if I don't have them then yes
if someone's like let's go out for ice
cream I go oh I guess I can't yeah if
there's pizza especially if people you
know at the last minute want to get
pizza or certain go out for dinner and
we haven't decided if they just like
just pizza I cut I have to go ahead I
can't really eat that our people
receptive to this when you tell them
like if you tell a group of friends or
even new people hey I'm like us and tell
her you know can you know can we do
something else can we get something else
or people normally receptive yes
especially in California actually
because in California a lot of people
are no people with various dietary
restrictions or own different diets and
so it's definitely hasn't really
affected my social life it just means
that we do something else you mentioned
lactase pills what exactly is a lactase
pedal and where do you get it how much
does it cause I lacked a spill is just a
little pill about and a little less than
an inch big by a quarter inch that is
just a number of units of lactase enzyme
so lactose intolerance means my body
doesn't produce lactase anymore which is
the enzyme that breaks down lactose
sugar into two different triggers so
this pill I eat it I always buy the fast
act pills so I can just eat it with my
first bite of food and it kind of
dissolves and has to break down all the
sugars
my stomach and so I take that with my
first bite of dairy and then I'm usually
good for about 45 minutes before I have
to take another one well how much do
they cost um I would say it's about ten
cents of pill so a 120 would be about
twelve to thirteen dollars at safeway
for example Wow so it's over the counter
and you think it's a good deal I think
it's a good deal because you know
especially since I'm lactose intolerant
I've cut down on the amount of dairy I
have incidentally so it means that if
I'm controlling it a one box 128 that's
120 servings of dairy products that's a
lot of dairy yeah and you know I
switched out the milk i buy for the one
that already is lactose free so that
means I don't have to take a pill every
time I drink a glass of milk is this a
tree you would ever want to change about
yourself at all definitely I just feel I
mean being lactose intolerant just means
I can't live my same life and eat the
same amount of eat the same foods and do
the same things I want to but I just
have to spend more money to do it
because I by the lactase lactose free
milk and I by the lactase pills to
supplement other meals are there any
advantages to being lactose intolerant
the only advantage I would think is if
you're trying to die it like if you're
trying to lose weight you're not going
to be eating the deep-dish Chicago style
pizzas or the burritos if you're lactose
intolerant because even with lactase
pills that might just still be too much
dairy to consume at one time so I mean
that's the only advantage in otherwise
it's just kind of like I said it's an
annoyance in your life so do people ever
tease you about it like do your friends
ever like you know we'll say nicely t
sure I can't imagine somebody like
teasing teasing you well actually the
last time I came here I walked in and
they're like hell you're Ryan you're
lactose intolerant and then people are
eating racing oh I guess you can't have
that but yeah I mean it's just light
hearted things it's just like I've got
my pills doesn't matter things like that
have you ever gotten your own personal
genetic information done from a company
like 23 me yes I have and did what did
that tell you about you being lactose
intolerant did it can
firm this or it confirmed I have the
genotype that is likely lactose
intolerant because since lactose
intolerant can also depend on
environmental factors like your your
actual gut bacteria that breaks down the
lactose it means I have the tendency to
be lactose intolerant but it doesn't
mean I am the only way you can confirm
that you are is that kind of know that
you are you said that you found out you
were lactose intolerant relatively
recently did you have the personal
genetic information before after you
knew that I was afterwards it was after
okay so I knew I was lactose intolerant
then I got the 23andme and it said yes
you have the genotype that is likely
lactose intolerant okay I said well yes
you're like yes correct it's like when I
you know you see the 23 music you are
likely you likely have brown eyes and I
look in the mirror and I go yes yes you
are correct 23 mini so you say the
lactase pills work the ones you take you
you say they're fast-acting and then you
take one and you're normally good for
like 45 minutes are there other types of
lactase pills out there sure there's
another type of lactase pills that's
more slow-acting and they're generally a
little cheaper but that one you have to
take about half an hour in advance of
eating any dairy and so for that kind
that means you have to kind of plan
ahead what you're eating where's since I
don't like that with in terms of
planning my meals often times I'm just I
take just the fast act pills because it
allows me to make quick decisions on
food and can you take two of your
fast-acting ones that wants to last
longer does that not work um I don't
know about it lasting longer but if I'm
eating a large thing of dairy so like
ice men sioned before the deep-dish
Chicago style pizza I'll take two I'll
take two at that first bite because I
know it's a lot to process so taking two
at once would help what would you say if
you could give advice to somebody who
let's say we're talking to Ryan three
years ago before he found out it was
lactose intolerant and he you know just
discovered that you're lactose
intolerant what advice would you give
that person I think the first advice
would be to test your limits on lactose
tolerance so I can have a bite of ice
cream or one nacho with cheese or what
that won't bother so like knowing your
limit on what you can have
about any kind of supplement is useful
and also to just make the decision
whether you're going to change your diet
or by the pills or some kind of
combination of both just kind of figure
it out or and looking to lactose free
alternatives to milk or they even have
lactose free ice cream now but it's very
expensive so it's like is it worth it to
buy the ice cream so you don't have to
take pills or do you want to take pills
every single time you eat ice cream sort
of thing it's kind of just decide all
the different ways to manage your large
chest and tolerance and figure out which
way is the best for you can you're
lactose intolerance get worse over time
or have you noticed you know that you
become even more intolerant now that you
use maybe the lactase pill um yes I
would definitely say I've become more
lactose intolerant since I discovered it
when I discovered it I still could have
a single serving of dairy and not
experience symptoms but now it's to the
point where I can't even have a full
serving of dairy so I can't have an
8-ounce class of lack of regular milk
without experiencing some symptoms so
yeah I think definitely it's been I've
been more lactose intolerant over the
time but I don't know what causes that
if it's just the fact that my body is
producing less and less and less and
that's a gradual thing or if it has
anything to do with supplementing it or
not having normal lactose so but I'm not
sure well thank you for coming in and
chatting with us yeah thanks for talking
on I don't get to talk about this day
