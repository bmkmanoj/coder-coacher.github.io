operations on vectors the first
operation we will describe for vectors
is addition one way to visualize the sum
of two vectors is to lay them end to end
the arrow formed starting at the tail of
the first arrow and ending at the head
of the second arrow gives the overall
total amount of change by the two
vectors this new arrow is the sum of the
first two vectors in addition to this
geometric interpretation of vector
addition we have a numeric
interpretation given the first two
vectors as a list of coordinates we can
add the two vectors by adding the
corresponding coordinates of each vector
since this first vector is 1 2 and the
second vector is 3 1 their sum vector is
4 3 notice that if we lay out the
vectors in a parallelogram shape the
some vector connects the points or both
chains of vectors start in this case the
origin and where the chains both end we
can subtract vectors in addition to
adding them here is the geometric
interpretation of vector subtraction
consider the vectors vnw both emanating
from the same point what vector would we
need to add to w in order for the sum to
be V we represent this geometrically by
drawing an arrow from the head of W to
the head of V this vector is what we
call V minus W since W plus the vector V
minus W equals V numerically we can
compute the difference between two
vectors by subtracting their
corresponding coordinates so taking this
vector to be 1/3 and this vector to be
5-1 their difference is -4 2 this is
reflected in our drawing since the
difference vector represents a change of
4 units to the left and 2 units up this
time if we look at our parallelogram
formed by X&amp;amp;Y notice that X minus y
connects the heads of the two initial
vectors in our chains if we reverse the
direction of this arrow will obtain Y
minus X another important
operation on vectors is scalar
multiplication in this case a vector is
multiplied by a number which we call a
scalar the term scalar is suggestive of
the word scale which is fitting because
the geometric interpretation of scalar
multiplication is to scale the size of a
vector multiplying a vector by two
doubles its length multiplying a vector
by one keeps it at the same length
multiplying a vector by one half cuts
its length in half we can also multiply
a vector by a negative number this
reverses the direction of the arrow
points in addition to possibly growing
or shrinking the vector numerically
scalar multiplication is computed by
multiplying each coordinate of the
vector by the scalar so two times the
vector 1 2 equals to 4 and negative 1/2
times the vector 3 2 1 equals the vector
minus 3 halves minus 1 minus 1/2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
