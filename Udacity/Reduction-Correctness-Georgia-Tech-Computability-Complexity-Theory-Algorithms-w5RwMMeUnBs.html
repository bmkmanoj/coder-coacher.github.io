reduction with the following theorem
consider a bipartite graph G and The
Associated flow Network F which we just
constructed the edges in G which have
flows of 1 in a maximum flow obtained by
ford-fulkerson on F constitute a maximum
matching in the original graph G to
prove this theorem we start by observing
that the flow across any edge is either
0 or 1
any augmenting path will have a
bottleneck capacity of 1 remember all
capacities are 1 so we'll always event
flows by 1 but 1 is also the maximum
flow that can go across any edge the
conservation of flow then implies that
each vertex is in at most one edge that
we return on the left-hand side we only
have one unit of capacity going in so we
can't have more than one unit of
capacity going out so each vertex on the
left-hand side will be included in at
most one edge and similarly for the
right-hand side we have at most one unit
of flow going out so we can have at most
one unit of flow going in which implies
that every vertex on the right will be
involved in that most one matched edge
in our output this means that the set of
edges in the original graph that have
flow 1 in the flow network constitute a
matching is it a maximum matching well
if there were a larger mapping it would
be trivial to construct a larger flow
just give those edges flow one in here
and connect them with Vout flow values
of 1/2 the source and the one on the
right with flow values of 1/2 the same
so yes it must be a maximum matching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
