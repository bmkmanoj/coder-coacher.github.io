for every visible item however many you
can fit onto the screen it'll also
create a couple in either direction to
make sure that we can scroll without
seeing a flicker as a new view is
created and populated then it creates
new items just in time so it's next in
line to be visible to the user so the
user never scrolls the bottom of the
list for this view will never request
that view from the adapter but this is
really just a half-measure
as you can see if the user keeps
scrolling we could potentially just keep
adding new views even if they disappear
off the top of the screen eventually
that's going to lead to the same impact
in memory use and performance as if we
had just created all of these views
directly at the beginning the solution
is recycling each view as it Scrolls off
the screen allowing it to be reused when
we need to show another item as it moves
into view at the top or bottom so rather
than having to create and then hold in
memory each item of the list as it comes
into view we only need to do the
creation step for the number of visible
items and a couple on either side then
whenever a new list item comes into view
we just update the data displayed in one
of the items in our recycle bin the
result less memory overhead smoother
scrolling and less view management you
have to do yourself
this same recycling behavior is
implemented across all adaptive you
descended classes such as gridview and
listview which also introduces the
reason that the adapter isn't built
directly into these controls themself by
keeping them separate your adapter
defines how to display each element of
the underlying data while the adaptive
view implementation itself is
responsible for controlling how each of
these elements is laid out be it a list
or a grid in these particular instances</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
