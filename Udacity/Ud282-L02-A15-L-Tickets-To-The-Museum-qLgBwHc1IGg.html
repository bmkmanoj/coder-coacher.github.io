have been nice to have an automated
discount let's build a program that
calculates the correct ticket price for
entrance to this museum the ticket price
should generally be ten dollars per
person but also include a discount so
that it's only five dollars in three
cases one for young people aged 15 and
under two for older people age greater
than 60 and three if you're a student of
some sort like you then you also get the
discount so how can we build a program
like this first let's keep track of our
ticket price by declaring it as a
variable and we'll give it an initial
general value of 10 which we can change
to our discount price of five in our
code in a bit then to tell if someone
qualifies for a discount we'll also need
variables that keep track of someone's
age and whether or not they're a student
I've chosen to represent age as a whole
number as an int and whether a person is
a student or not can be either true or
false so that will be a boolean so let's
say we have access to the value of these
two variables but we don't exactly know
what their value will be now let's
consider our first discount condition
that someone is 15 years old or younger
we basically want to turn this into an
if statement where our test condition
checks if age is less than or equal to
15 and if that's true we execute code to
give this person a discount and set our
ticket price to five dollars so to write
our first test for ages 15 and under as
a boolean comparison we'd say if age is
less than or equal to 15 then if this is
true inside our if we want to set the
ticket price to our discount value of 5
and at the end of our code I want to
print out the value of ticket price for
us to see now if we run this code and
the age variable is less than 15 say 10
years old we'll pass our if test
condition and our ticket price will be
set to five then we'll print this value
out but if our age is greater than 15
like 25 we don't enter our if statement
and our ticket price will remain our
initial general value of 10 and that
value will print out our other two
discount conditions will be checking if
someone's age is greater than not
greater than an equal
to 60 years old and if a person is a
student let's complete those checks in
the following quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
