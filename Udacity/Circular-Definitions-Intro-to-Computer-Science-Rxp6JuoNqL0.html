first thing we should think about is
well can we give a base case right all
of the other recursive definitions we
had we had a way of stopping so we had a
base case right with factorial we said
we're going to predefined that we know
the value of factorial when the input is
zero we know that the value is 1 we're
not going to define it in terms of
factorial we're gonna know its value we
did this for palindrome we said
palindrome we have a base case when the
input string is the empty string it's
pre defined as a palindrome we don't
have to do anything else and we did this
for Fibonacci where we had two base
cases but for all these definitions we
had some starting point that was not
defined in terms of the thing we're
defining and that's why it was a good
recursive definition because we have the
base case we don't have one here so
let's try to invent one let's suppose
that we made our base case so if we're
going to fix this what we need to do is
is invent a base case maybe that will
solve our problems so let's try an add a
base case so suppose we assume we know
the popularity of Alice and sadly Alice
is not very popular her popularity score
is a 1 no so that looks like a base case
right we defined the base case for
factorial for 0 for palindrome for space
let's pick Alice as our base case now
and that works like this for the
mathematical definition for the Python
code what we would need to do is add the
base case as an if statement so we'd
insert a line here that says if P is
Alice return alice's popularity score
which is our base case which is 1 so
this looks more like the recursive
definitions we've seen now we have a
question see if this actually works so
the question is would this definition
work the possible answers are only if
everyone is friends with Alice only if
no one is friends with Alice only if
from every person in the network there's
some way that you can follow links that
eventually reaches Alice only if there
are no cycles in the graph so there's no
way to start from one person and end up
at the same person by following
friendships by following friendship
links and the final choice
is know that there's really no situation
where this definition works well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
