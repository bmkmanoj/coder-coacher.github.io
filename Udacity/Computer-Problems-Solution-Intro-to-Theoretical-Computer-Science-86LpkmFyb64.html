computer problems so let's just check
the three rules first one given an essay
by student that is definitely a finite
string using a constant number of
symbols so rule one here is okay does
that sa have at least 10,000 characters
well the output is saying either yes or
no so that is easily fulfill about and
of course the answer here is also
objectively correct you can easily count
the number of characters and say yes
it's at least 10,000 or no it's not so
this is definitely a computer problem
the second one of course well the output
would still be a finite string because
you could say depending on the grading
system ABCD or 1234 of course the output
is not objectively correct because
different instructors tend to sometimes
at least disagree on the grade that and
si deserves so this is not a computer
problem although they have been attempts
for automated grading which is just
weird to say the least does the essay
contain any misspelled words now this is
a tricky one so the input again is
finite the output basically just says
yes or no or it can even specify the
word the problem is that it's sometimes
very hard to say if something is a
spelling mistake I'll give you one
example consider for example this
sentence here he was attacked by a rat
at first sight this sentence adhesive
I've written it in the correct way does
not contain any misspelled words but
actually it could contain a misspelled
word because what if the author actually
had meant to type he was attacked by a
bat that sentence by itself might make
perfect sense but he you could still
have simply mistyped this word here
although of course your computer has a
spell checker even you might have
noticed that the spell checker sometimes
is wrong because it sometimes just
cannot figure out in which context
you're saying your sentence and even if
it were a very very strong computer in
this example here you cannot objectively
determine if this is the right answer it
can be dependent more or less totally on
the author this problem here is actually
not a computer problem in the way that
it stated here but this was a bit of a
tricky one so I hope you're not
frustrated if you didn't get that but it
tells you that sometimes you have to
watch out very carefully with these
rules they sound very simple but
actually there's some tricky details
hidden in here so let's go to the next
set of problems
two integers what is there some that of
course is a very classic computer
problem the integers are given as
numbers 1 2 3 4 5 the output is a number
that's also fine it's finite and adding
is something where you can definitely
have a definitive and objective answer
does the smaller integer divide the
larger one yes absolutely a computer
problem the answer is yes or no and you
can objectively say if the answer is
correct or no this one down here is not
a computer problem and actually it's not
a computer problem for two reasons one
reason which is a bit technical is the
RAM computer or a normal computer
doesn't really have true randomness a
normal computer generates numbers that
seem like random using an algorithm but
that is not random but as I said this is
a bit technical I think the main reason
why this is not a computer problem is
that it's not possible once you have the
answer to actually know if this answer
is correct so if the number was indeed
generated at random so let me give you
one example so for example I have the
number 7 and 10 and now I say that I
have randomly generated a 9 which lies
between the two you have no way of
checking if I really generated this
number using coin flips or throwing a
dice or if I just made that up or maybe
if I use an algorithm that always
outputs a 9 so there's no way to
determine from an output if that output
has really been generated using a random
process and that is basically also the
same reason why this one here is not
correct of course you can kind of
determine the likelihood if this is a
very long string of zeros and ones you
can say well this looks more or less
like a random string or not random
string but actually if the string is
generated choosing uniformly between
zeros and ones any string is as likely
as any other strings so so it's not
possible to objectively check the answer
here so for example if I say I generated
a string using a number of coin flips
and I have heads heads heads heads heads
heads heads heads it might not look
random but maybe I was just lucky at
that moment now the final answer here
and if you got that right without
checking this answer video then you're
almost a master of theoretical computer
science because this again is a quite
tricky one in my mind I will tell you
that this is
not a computer problem why is lab not a
computer problem you can enter square
root of 5 into your computer usually you
do it like this into google for example
and it will tell you that the square
root of 5 is 2.2 3606 798 but that is
actually not the correct answer for
example if i enter it into another
calculator or web page that has more
digits and that will tell me that it's
actually not six seven nine eight well
actually 2.2 360 6606 797 749 978 96 96
409 1736 68 m and so on the square root
of 5 is an infinite string if i ask a
computer to calculate the square root of
52 within a certain precision say i want
the first 10 digits or so then it is a
computer problem but just asking a
computer to calculate the square root of
5 in this way is not correct but why am
I nitpicking you here like this well the
thing is this Infinity's will play a
very important role here in this unit
when it comes to problems that no
computer can ever solve this is why it's
very important to make sure that the
input is finite and the output is finite
so if you do not make the screw or
phrase the question here very precisely
then some of the results will change or
not be correct so it's very important to
ensure finiteness and later in this unit
you will see why it's so important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
