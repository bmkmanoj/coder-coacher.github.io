principles that one has to keep in mind
as an OS designer in designing operating
systems for parallel machines the first
principle is of course cache conscious
decisions what that means is you only
pay attention to locality exploits
affinity to caches in scheduling
decisions for instance and you want to
reduce the amount of sharing of data
structures if you reduce the amount of
sharing of data structures you're
reducing contention so limit the amount
of sharing to system data structures
we've seen this when we talked about
different synchronization algorithms we
talked about how we can reduce the
amount of sharing of the system data
structure so that we can limit the
amount of contention that's important to
do and the other thing that you want to
do is you want to keep the memory
accesses local to every node in the
multiprocessor as possible and basically
what that means is you're reducing the
distance between the accessing processor
and the memory already the distance is
pretty big when you go outside the chip
and access the memory over here but the
distance is even more if you have to
traverse the interconnection Network and
reach into a memory that is on a
different node of the multi processor so
keeping memory access local is another
important principle that you want to
adhere to in designing operating system
for multi processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
