situation with a prior a test there's a
certain sensitivity in a certain
specificity when you receive say a
positive test result what you do is you
take your prior you multiply in the
probability of this test result given C
and you multiply in the probability of
the test result given not C so this is
your branch for the consideration of you
have cancer this is your branch for the
consideration if no cancer when you're
done with this you arrive at a number to
know combines the cans apophysis with
the test result both for the cancer
hypothesis and did not connect cancer
hypothesis now what you do you add those
up and then normally don't add up to one
you get a certain quantity which happens
to be the total probability that the
test is what it was this case positive
and all you do next is divided or
normalize this thing over here by the
sum over here in the same on the right
side the divider is the same for both
cases because this is your cancer branch
in on cancer range but this guy doesn't
depend on the cancer variable anymore
what you now get out is the desired
posterior probability and those add up
to 1 if you did everything correct as
shown over here this is your algorithm
for Bayes rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
