outputs the procedure almost writes
itself especially since we already know
the code that we wanted to execute
before we define the procedure so I'm
going to write the procedure by
modifying the code here so first what
we're going to do is make a little space
erasing the code that's not part of the
four lines that we want to turn in the
procedure so now I've I haven't modified
the code at all what I have is almost
exactly what I need for the body of the
procedure this is what we want to do
what we need to do is modify that to get
in the inputs and turn it into a
procedure so to make it a procedure we
need to use the DEF name syntax so we're
going to define the procedure get next
target so now we need our parameters the
parameters are the inputs to the
procedure and we decided what the input
should be is the web contents that's a
string giving the contents of the
webpage and that's what we had in the
variable page so we can call that page
again here that's what we're passing in
as our input and now we have the body of
the procedure the code is exactly the
same as the code we have before but this
time instead of page being whatever it
was here page is whatever we pass in as
the input of the procedure and we can
change the name of page it sort of makes
sense to change that name this code
works no matter what we pass in doesn't
have to be a web page any string that we
pass in this code will find it so it
makes more sense to give it a slightly
more generic name we'll change the name
to s if we change the name of the
parameter well everywhere that we use
page now we don't have the value of page
what we have is the value of s which is
the name of the parameter so we'll
change all of those two S's as well so
we're almost done there's one big thing
we have left to do and that's how do we
get the outputs right we said what we
want the outputs to be is the URL and
the value of n quotient we need some way
of getting those back and the way to you
do that is to use return returns a
special construct in Python so we have
the keyword return followed by a list of
all the things that we want to return
from the procedure so what we return is
a list of any number of expressions so
created by commas we can have 0 return
expressions that would mean there's no
output and it actually is useful to have
procedures with no output sometimes
that's not true if we just think of
procedures as things that map inputs to
outputs but procedures can also do other
things they can do what we call side
effects and what side effects are things
that we can see but that aren't the
outputs and an example of a side effect
would be well if we printed something
out we would see that result happen we
see everything that happens when the
code in procedure runs but we wouldn't
get it as an output so in this case we
do want to have outputs from get next
target we want to return results so we
know how to continue and we decided what
the output should be are the value of
the URL so we want to find the string
that's the next target and the value of
the end quote so we know the position
where it was found so let's see if you
can figure out how to finish the return
statement and your goal is to figure out
the code that we need after the return
to finish this procedure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
