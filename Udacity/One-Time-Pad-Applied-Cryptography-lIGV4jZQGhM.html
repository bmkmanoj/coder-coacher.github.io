understand one-time pads so Alison
body--the have agreed on a perfectly
random key and that Alice will send Bob
to answer the question are you taking CS
3 day 7 as either the single character Y
or the single character n this will be
encoded using the string to bits
procedure which takes in a string and
gives you a list of bits and the results
of string to bits y is 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 and
there's a row for n is 1 0 0 1 1 1 0
Mallory knows nothing about the key are
the message but she intercepts the
transmission between Alice and Bob and
intercepts this sequence of bits and
Mallory wants to cost trouble between
Alice and Bob so she wants to make Bob
hear the opposite of what Alice said so
if Alice sent a y Mallory wants Bob to
hear an N if Alice sent an N Mallory
wants Bob to hear oh why so what should
Mallory send instead of the original
message that she intercepted and your
answer should be in the form of 7 bits
each of which is a 0 or 1 so once you
understand the answer to this I want to
encourage you to join an open discussion
question which is is there a way to
solve this problem without using
anything other than a one-time pad is
there a way for Alice and Bob to
communicate correctly the answer to this
question and know that it can't be
altered in transmission and still
preserve all the privacy properties of a
one-time pad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
