let's look at some creation tips for use
case diagrams the first tip is that when
you define a use case use a name that
communicates purpose it should be clear
what the use case refers to by just
looking at the name of the use case
second tip is to define one atomic
behavior per use case so try not to put
more than one specific scenario into a
use case why because this will make the
use cases easier to understand and
better suited for the rules that we just
discussed to define test cases to do
planning to define an architecture and
so on and so forth define the flow of
events clearly so again do it from the
perspective of an outsider an outsider
should be able to read the description
of the flow of events and understand
exactly how the system works or how the
specific piece of functionality works as
we suggested for the class diagram
provide only essential details so there
is no need to provide all the
nitty-gritty details about the use case
just provide enough details so that the
use case is complete and understandable
and finally even though we didn't cover
that there is a way to factor common
behaviors and factor variance when
defining use cases so I would encourage
you to look at how to do that for
example by looking at the additional UML
documentation and to try to factor out
these common behaviors and variance
typical example would be assisting the
requires logging like the one that we
just discussed will probably require an
initial login step for each use case it
is possible that instead of describing
the same steps or same sub steps for
each use case you can factor that out
and create a use case that you then
include in your own use cases as I said
we didn't cover this for simplicity but
feel free to further read about UML and
to see how you can actually factor out
behaviors and factor variance which can
be very useful in practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
