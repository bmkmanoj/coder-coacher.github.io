I've created a small app to show you how
you can manipulate images here we have
an image inside a card view with a label
composed of a couple of text views below
the card view are a series of radio
buttons with different transformations
and scale types you can apply to the
above image the default scale type for
an image is fit centre it skills the
images to fit inside the view while
keeping the aspect ratio if axes don't
match the empty space is distributed on
both sides of the image either the top
and bottom or the left and right fit
start and fit in also scale the image to
fit inside the view but they align the
image so that the unused space appears
before or after the image fit XY scales
the image to use all the space in the
view even if the aspect ratio changes in
other words unless your image has an
aspect ratio that closely matches your
view using fit X Y might be a bad idea
we have 3 Center options Center Center
crop and Center inside sinner displays
the image centered in the view with no
scaling at all in this case the image is
larger than our view so we only see a
small portion of it Center inside
attempts to Center the image in the view
and we'll scale it down to fit if the
image is smaller than the view it won't
scale it up and the extra space will be
evenly distributed around the image if
the image is larger than the view center
inside will look similar to the results
of fit Center sooner crop scales the
image so that both the width and the
height exceed the dimensions of the view
it centers the image and then crops
everything that was left around it but
not in view it can make an already great
image more impactful if none of those
options fit your needs you can select
matrix and build a matrix composed of
translations scaling and rotation for
this major
I scaled the X and the y axes in half
and translated a hundred pixels in each
direction last but not least there's
this radio button here there isn't a no
scale type this is my not so vague way
of saying don't use ill sized images for
your views or add large padding's it
makes your images look lower quality
whatever you choose play around with
images of similar quality and size to
what you'll use in your production app
to see what works best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
