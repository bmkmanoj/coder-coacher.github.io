as follows only for logging into a
workstation the username and password
are used and of course they have to be
securely communicated to the server over
insecure links we'll see how that is
done but the key point is that username
and password is only used for logging in
once a user is logged into a workstation
at that point onwards for the rest of
the login session the intent is to use
ephemeral IDs and ephemeral keys for all
the subsequent Venis device
communication recall that Venus is the
process that resides on the virtual work
station acting as a surrogate for the
user for file caching and vices of
course the server that is living inside
a secure environment and thus Venus vice
communication happens over insecure
links that's where we're going to use
ephemeral IDs and keys so this gives
rise to three classes of client-server
interactions the first interaction is
logging in imagine you're a student and
you're doing a course project what is it
that you're gonna do you're gonna walk
up to a workstation and log in
presenting a username and password to
the workstation and this username and
password is going to be used as the
basis for the client-server
communication that lets you authenticate
yourself to the server
now once you've authenticated yourself
to the server what are you going to do
well you want to do a course project and
for that course project you probably
need to download some files from the
server and that requires that Venus that
is running on your workstation establish
an RPC session with the server in order
to fetch the files that you need to work
on for your course project that's the
second class of client-server
communication establishing an RPC
session
now once you establish an RPC session
then you can request the files that you
want as a user as a student you want
certain files to be accessed during this
RPC session you bring those files and
once you're brought in the files that
you want you can close the RPC session
work on your project locally on the
workstation and once you're done with
completing whatever work you needed to
do you may establish a new RPC session
to upload the results of your work back
into the file server so the three
classes of client-server interactions
are logging in which happens exactly
once for the entire login session and
RPC session establishment which may
happen several times during the time
that you're logged in to a workstation
every time you decide oh I want to fetch
a new file oh I want to store this file
back into the server the third set of
interaction is the actual file system
access during the session once this RPC
session has been established by Venus
with Vice then you as the user you may
want to work on a particular file you
may open a file at that point Venus will
go using this RPC session and fetch the
required file and cache it locally for
you to use it and later on if you close
the file at that point Venus may commit
the changes that you made to the file to
the central file server again so that's
the kind of file system operation that's
the third class of client-server
interaction and for both RPC session
establishment and for the actual access
to the file system during an RPC session
we want to use ephemeral IDs and keys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
