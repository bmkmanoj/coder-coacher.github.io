Network consists of among other things a
directed graph G and we will disallow
antiparallel edges to simplify some of
the equations this is not a serious
limitation as we'll see we'll
distinguish two special vertices in the
graph a source typically labeled s this
is where whatever is flowing through the
network starts from and a sink typically
labeled T this is where the flow ends up
we call all other vertices internal to
keep our equations a little simpler
we'll assume there are no incoming edges
into S or outgoing edges from T
associated with every pair of vertices
is a capacity which indicates how much
flow it is possible to send directly
between two vertices we'll assume that
these capacities are always non-negative
integers this will make some of the
arguments easier and it's not a serious
limitation in fact the Laster algorithm
we see will overcome it also note that
if there is no edge in the graph then
the capacity is defined to be zero
that's the flow Network the flow itself
is a function from pairs of vertices to
the non-negative reals clearly then it
must be non-negative and it can't exceed
the capacity for any pair of vertices
also we require that between any two
vertices at least one direction be zero
it doesn't make sense to have flow going
from one vertex to another only to send
it back again
lastly we require that flow be conserved
at every internal vertex we define F n
to be the flow into a vertex and f out
to be the flow out and we require that
the to be equal so for example in this
node here I have four plus two coming in
and I have five plus one going out these
are both six so we say that flow is
conserved at this vertex intuitively
this just means that internal nodes
can't generate or absorb any of the
stuff that's flowing those are the jobs
of the source end of the sink the
overall value of the flow is defined as
the flow going out of the source or
equivalently
the flow going into the sink</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
