pull out one link it had a where clause
that looks something like this let's
talk about how we can make this a little
bit fancier so instead of just saying ID
equals 2 let's change this let's change
this constraint a little bit I've
changed the clause to be instead of ID
equals something to submitter ID equals
5 okay so I've added an N Clause so
select star from links where submitter
ID equals 5 and votes is greater than 23
and this is a perfectly legit sequel
query and allows us to you know be even
more expressive
we could change this a little bit even
more we could change this and through an
or for example and this would return us
all of the links that were submitted by
user 5 or all of the links who have more
than 23 votes and so you can see sequels
fairly expressive and you can use and
and or and you can use equals and
greater than or equal to and you know
less than and all sorts of and all sorts
of cool stuff and already you can see we
can ask fairly sophisticated questions
