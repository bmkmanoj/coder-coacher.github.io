following way come back to some
operations allocates exactly one item in
the output for each true input and zero
items in the output for each false input
this is useful of course and compact as
a really common operation but more
generally we can do a compact like
operation where the number of output
items can be computed dynamically for
each input item let me offer a graphics
example to show why this might be useful
the input to most real-time computer
graphics pipelines is a set of triangles
some of these triangles might appear on
the screen and some might not and so we
generally test to see if each triangle
is visible or not before we pass it down
the pipeline for later processing this
is a compact operation we compact an
input stream of triangles some of which
are visible and some are not into a
smaller output stream where all
triangles in the output stream are
visible and we know how to do this with
compact now here's the more complicated
problem what if a triangle intersects
the boundary of the screen or window for
example this triangle here or this
triangle here in this case we apply an
operation called clipping where we cut
the triangle with the boundary and then
triangulate the resulting shape so for
this triangle for instance we're going
to convert it to this triangle right
here this triangle has left behind a
trapezoid and so we only want to deal
with triangles so instead we triangulate
this trapezoid and send two triangles
down the pipe now we have a situation
where we input a set of triangles and
each triangle can produce 0 1 or
possibly many output triangles and we
want to output the resulting triangles
in a dense array here's a good geometry
quiz question for you has really nothing
to do with course material but it's a
pretty cool question nonetheless what is
the maximum number of triangles that can
result from clipping a triangle with a
rectangle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
