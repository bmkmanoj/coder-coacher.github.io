to fill in the blanks such that if we
execute this code and print the list P
we get the output one two three we have
to find the initial values of P and then
we update each entry and P once and only
once so although this says p 0 and this
says p 0 and this says p 0 this p 0 is
actually different value than these 3
it'll helped us think through it if we
actually label so we'll say this is the
first one the second first second and we
know everybody's on the final values
this equation equals 1 this one equals 2
this one equals 3 so let's do a little
algebra I'm going to rewrite these on
the side to make it easier to read with
just this equation there's nothing we
can do all we know is that the initial
values of p 0 and P 1 have to add to 1
we can't get any more specific than that
so unlike the first equation we can
actually simplify this a little more
remember that we know the final values
of each entry so we can actually
simplify this to just say 1 plus P of 2
equals 2 and with a little algebra we
know that P 2 equals 1 in our last
equation we can just quickly glance at
it and see that the final value of p 0
plus the final value of p 1 equals 3
what we're given that the final values
are 1 &amp;amp; 2 so all we're saying is 1 plus
2 equals 3 which doesn't help us very
much so what did we learn we know the
last value has to be 1 and we know the
first and the second values have to add
up to 1 we can't do anything from here
this is all the information we have and
as long as we satisfy those two
constraints this entry plus this entry
equals 1 then we'll get the correct
answer so to sample solutions would be 1
0 1 and an equally valid one is negative
