at our data age and friend count across
the categorical variable gender usually
color a shape tend to be aesthetics for
representing such changes over a
categorical variable but what if we
looked at age and friend count over say
another numerical variable for example
we might notice that since users are
likely to accumulate friends over their
time using Facebook that Facebook tenure
is important for predicting friend count
tenure or how many days since
registering with Facebook is associated
with age the first people to start using
Facebook were college students as of
2004 and 2005 I was lucky enough to be
part of that group and joined the site
on February 3rd 2005 as a result I've
amassed more friends over time and have
over 1200 of them on the other hand 14
year old users have had less time to
accumulate the same number of friends
one way to explore all four variables
friend count age gender and tenure is
using a two-dimensional display like a
scatterplot and we can bend one of the
quantitative variables and compare those
bends in this case we can group users by
the year that they joined so let's
create a new variable called you're
joined in our data frame this variable
is going to hold the year that our users
first joined Facebook in this next
programming exercise you're going to
create this variable you're joined and
put it inside the data frame you need to
make use of the variable tenure and use
2014 as the reference here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
