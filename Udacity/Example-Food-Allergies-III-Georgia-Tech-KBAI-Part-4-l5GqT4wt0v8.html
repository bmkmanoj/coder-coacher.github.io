third example comes along and the green
outline of this example shows that this
is a positive example of the concept
because this is the positive example of
the concert we must try to generalize
the most specific model so a
generalization of the specific concept
that includes this positive example is
shown here here the meal was breakfast
hiddy meal was lunch so we can
generalize over any meal here today was
saturday here it was Friday so we can
generalize over any day of course we
could have also generalized to just
friday or saturday but for simplicity
will generalize over any day similarly
for breakfast or lunch generalized to
any meal but at this stage there is
another element to the processing we
must examine all these specializations
of the most general concept and see
whether any one of them needs to be
pruned out the pruning may need to be
done in order to make sure that each
specialization here is consistent with
the positive examples that are coming in
so in this case if we look at the first
specialization here which says I am
allergic to breakfast at any place on
any day this cannot be a generalization
of this particular concept put another
way there is no way that this break fast
here can include can cover this positive
example which deals with lunch but yet
another way the only way I can move from
breakfast to any hair would be if I
generalize but in this direction i can
only specialize therefore this must be
pruned out as we prune this first
concept out we're left with only two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
