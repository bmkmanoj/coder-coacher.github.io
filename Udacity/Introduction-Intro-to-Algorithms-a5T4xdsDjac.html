215 you could call this unit putting
things in order or who's your 17th best
friend so by now you might not be
surprised that I actually have a magic
trick worked out that's actually in this
case relevant to the topic at hand so in
this magic trick I'm going to put a
bunch of animals in order with your help
so here's some data I have it stored as
a Python structure at the moment call it
animals it has 11 animals in it
alphabetized dog to sparrow and I've
gone on the internet and looked up the
speed how fast each of these animals is
its weight approximately in kilograms a
life span how long they tend to live and
how big their brains are measured in
grams I did not go and measure these
animals brains so a pretty common
operation in social network analysis and
lots of other problems is to be able to
put items in order so in this particular
case we have a bunch of animals we'd
like to put them in order but there's
lots of different dimensions on which to
order them so what we're going to do is
we're going to look at a linear
combination of these numeric features
and you're going to pick for me the
weights the positive weights to put on
each of these different attributes and
then we're going to take a sum in fact
I've got the code right here for you to
look at so what I'd like you to do is is
run this code on this data and what you
do is you call importance rank on this
data set the animals and you give it the
weights so I gave it a weight of one for
the speed point for for the wait to for
the lifespan and point one for the brain
mass and so if you were to run it with
these weights it would actually compute
a score for each of the animals and then
print them out in sorted order but I
want you to give your own weight don't
use mine because that wouldn't be very
tricky with it anyway you want just as
long as they are not negative or zero
what the program is going to print out
are the numbers 0 through 10 for the 11
different animals and I want you to make
a note of I don't know let's say the the
fourth highest in the list the one
that's associated with the number three
and I want you to make note of which
animal appears in this
chin and mark the corresponding circle
and what makes this a magic trick is
that I the algorithm using the running
time is so fast that it's big theta of
negative n that is to say i can compute
the answer to this question before
you've asked the question so i have
already run this I know what answer
you're going to get but now you need to
run it to make it so and let's see if
you're right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
