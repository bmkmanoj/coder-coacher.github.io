can figure out either through
experiments or logic alone but probably
you'll want to do some experiments how
default parameters work and why there's
certain pitfalls to using them one issue
some people have with the provided list
append method is it doesn't actually
return it it's a really common mistake
to assign to pee the result of P append
in this case well P append modifies the
value of P but it doesn't return the
list p it returns none so after this the
value of P will be none which is
probably not what we wanted there are
lots of situations where we might want
to use a pen in this kind of functional
way we might want to pass in the result
of appending to a new function so I'm
going to try to define a function that
does that so I want to function my
append that behaves like this if we call
it with just one parameter it'll create
a new list containing that as the only
element if we call it like this passing
into parameters the first one being
orange the second one the result of my
pen tap well then what we would like to
get is a list containing the elements
apple and orange this will allow us to
write code in a fairly compact way so we
could try to define my appendix this
using a default parameter this seems to
almost work go here will call my append
as shown above and we do indeed get the
list apple orange as desired but there's
something really broken about this code
and I want to see if you can figure out
what it is you may need to do a few
experiments to figure that out but it
should all make sense what you think it
through here the choices the default
parameter is initialized an empty list
but default parameters can only be none
the second choice that the default
parameters initialize when the function
is first called and then that same value
is reused each time the third choice of
the default list parameters initialize
when the function is defined and that
same object is reused for each call see
if you can figure out which is the
reason this code doesn't behave as
desired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
