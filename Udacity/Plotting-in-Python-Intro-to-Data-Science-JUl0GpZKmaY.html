encode information into your
visualization and how to make an
effective visualization but we still
haven't yet discussed how you can make
graphics like this short of drawing them
with pen and paper there are a number of
packages for plotting in Python one of
the most popular is matplotlib for this
course however I'd like to go over
plotting music of a Python library
called ggplot which very closely
recreates the syntax used in ARS ggplot2
library if matplotlib is so widely used
why should we use ggplot well I'd like
to use this package for a few reasons
first what it produces is a bit more
aesthetically pleasing than matplotlib
second it's an implementation of a
pretty neat concept called the grammar
of graphics which basically claims that
there's a grammar involved in composing
graphical components of statistical
graphics the Gigi and Gigi plot actually
comes from grammar of graphics it also
plays nicely with the pandas dataframes
we've been using in this course to
quickly summarize the ideas behind the
grammar of graphics plots convey
information through their aesthetics
such as exposition or y-position
the elements in a given plot are
geometric shapes such as points lines or
bars some of these shapes can have
aesthetics of their own such as their
size or their color you can think of
creating plots in ggplot through the
grammar of graphics as adding layers to
our plot the first step in creating a
graphic is always to create our plot
which is essentially going to be our
canvas this can be done by calling
ggplot data
aes x bar y VAR data here is going to be
a panda's data frame and x bar and y bar
are going to be columns in that data
frame so what we're doing here is saying
let's make a GG plot the data source is
going to be our data frame and the
quantities that were interested in
plotting our X bar and y bar this might
be district and number of odd haron
Ruhlman --tz-- or position and number of
players something like that
so what we've done here is we've made
our GG plot we've said that the data
source that
we'll use as handes data frame and that
the variables that we'll look at our X
bar and y bar this might be district and
number of Aadhaar enrolled if we were
using our odd hard data or team and
total number of players if we were using
our baseball data something like that
okay so so far that we've said that
we'll have a plot which is mapping X bar
to the x axis y bar to the y axis but we
haven't said yet what type of geometric
object is going to represent this data
so if we add plus G on points to this
statement we'll create a scatter plot if
we also add plus G on line of the
graphic we'll connect all these points
to each other with lines now say that we
wanted these points to have a particular
color we can pass color equals coral
into G on point and also passed color
equals coral into G M line and after we
do that both the points and the lines
will have the color coral this is the
second step of making a plot in ggplot
that is choosing which type of geometric
objects will represent the data the
final step here is going to be adding
some label so that our plot will have
some context like a title or an X label
or a y label this can be done much in
the same way that we added the points
and lines to our plot we can add a GG
title to title our plot an X lab which
will be X label to provide an XL and a y
labs do the same with the y axis now all
I have to do is perceive this entire
command by print and I'll produce a plot
in Python
why don't you try implementing these
ideas to create a graphic of your own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
