let's go ahead and use it in practice so
what we're going to do is when we were
in our write form function when we print
out values that came from the user we
want to make sure they are escaped so
we're going to call it on everything
that came from the user so we've called
our escape HTML function on each of
these variables that came from the user
and so now when we when we render the
form back to the user we'll have these
new escaped versions of their input okay
so here we are in our browser let's go
ahead and enter some broken text well
enter the same broken text we entered
before starting with a quote and uh you
know what they're just normal stuff for
here and now when we submit our form we
get our an error message and our HTML
isn't totally broken
remember the escaped versions of strings
render as as the unescape versions in
the form so in reality our HTML said
ampersand quote ampersand less than and
percent greater than ampersand less than
BR you know you get the picture but when
the browser renders it it looks totally
normal now we've got our air-handling
pretty solid you can type in all sorts
of garbage into these fields and we get
an error message and when then you type
in the correct answer it says it worked
so let's type in the correct answer and
now that we've got the error case
handled pretty good let's handle the
success case a little bit better so we
type in a valid date and we click Submit
and we get our success message but this
page has one of has a major limitation
the first is that we can't link to it if
we try to link to this page if we share
someone if I want to say hey you know to
my friend you know look at look at how
good I am at entering dates and here's a
URL to prove it I can't share this URL
because if I share it
he just gets an empty form and you know
he doesn't get to see how good a job I
did so let's submit this again the other
problem this page has if I want to
reload it my browser says this you know
hey do you want to resubmit this form
that's because we're reloading a page
that was drawn with a post and if you
read load a page that's drawn with a
post the browser says hey should I do
that post again that's what this dialog
box is
and know just about all of your browsers
will have some message that basically
says that same thing do you want to
resubmit this form if you click continue
it runs our application again and it
draws this message again that's not
quite the behavior we want this is
annoying for a couple reasons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
