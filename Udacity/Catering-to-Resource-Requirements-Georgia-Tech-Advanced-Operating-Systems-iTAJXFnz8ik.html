include time on the CPU the memory that
it needs for holding its instructions
and data and peripheral devices that it
may have to access during the course of
its execution
and so on now are the resource
requirements of a program known to the
operating system before you launch it
well yes and no the operating system
knows enough about the program at the
time of launch so that from the disk it
can create a memory footprint for this
application so for instance on your
favorite platform when you click on an
icon what is going on is a piece of the
operating system called the operating
system loader is reading in that this
resident image of that application and
creating a memory resident image of that
application so this is what is called a
memory footprint and the memory
footprint of the program contains the
code that needs to get executed on the
processor global data that it might be
accessing the stack that is needed when
the program is making procedure calls
and the heap which is the dynamic memory
that it might be needing during the
course of its execution so this is what
is called the memory footprint of the
program then that's what is created by
the operating system loader at the point
where you click on an icon once a
program starts running can the
application ask for additional resources
at runtime of course this is exactly the
service that is provided by the
operating system for example if the
application needs more memory it can
make an operating system call and
similarly if it needs to make a
connection to access a web server it
makes an operating system call the
operating system then performs the
service on behalf of the application and
the application can then continue with
whatever it needs to get done that's how
an operating system caters to the
resource requirements of applications so
in other words
in addition to catering to the initial
requirements of an application at the
point of launching it the operating
system is also the broker through which
a running application can request and
get additional resources during its
execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
