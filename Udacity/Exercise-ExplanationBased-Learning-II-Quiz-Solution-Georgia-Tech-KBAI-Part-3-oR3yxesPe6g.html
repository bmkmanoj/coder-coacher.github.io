of these concepts would allow us to
complete the previous proof the oven
mitt or the wooden spoon the definition
of oven mitt tells us that it protects
against heat because it limits heat
transfer so using oven mitt we can
complete this proof
however the wooden spoon allows us to do
that too by just bypassing the thick
sides and being made of clay all
together the wooden spoon definition
told us that if it has a handle at
protects against heat we already knew
that the object had a handle so using
that definition we know that it protects
against heat while ignoring the thick
sides and it's made of clay so either of
those would actually let us complete
this proof there are a couple of other
points to note about this exercise an
important question in knowledge-based AI
is what knowledge does one need it's not
a question of putting in a lot of
knowledge into AI program instead the
real question is in order to accomplish
a goal what is the minimal amount of
knowledge that the air agent actually
needs let's see how this applies here
the goal was to show that the object is
a mug instead of putting on a lot of
knowledge the agent starts asking what
do we need in order to show that the
object can protect against heat what do
I need in order to show that the RF is
stable and then it goes about searching
for that knowledge the second point to
note here is that depending on the
background knowledge available the agent
would opportunistically build the right
kind of causal proof so if the agent
knows about a wooden spoon we'll put
this proof if on the other hand the air
agent knew not about the wooden spoon
but about the oven mitt then it would
use this particular proof which proof
the agent will build will depend upon
the precise background knowledge
available to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
