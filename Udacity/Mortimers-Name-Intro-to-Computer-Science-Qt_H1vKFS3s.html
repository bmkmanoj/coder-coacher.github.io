discerning Mortimer so there's a lot of
interesting and somewhat surprising
stuff going on here so I hope when you
solve this if you did it by an
experiment you tried to find a general
rule instead of just seeing what the
result was if you didn't do that yet try
it now see if you can figure out a
general rule for why we end up with this
result then come back for the
explanation which will follow so here's
what's going on here so we have this
class hierarchy and when we have
multiple base classes the order in which
they're listed matters so we listed
discerning bear first that means the
discerning black bear will inherit the
nit method from discerning bear what
happens in the new method of discerning
bear is we call super passing and
discerning bear that means ignoring
definition the super bear and calling in
it looking just at this part you would
think well that means we're going to
call the baronet method and that's what
would normally happen if we just started
with a discerning bear that's not what
happens though what we get when we have
super discerning bear self well remember
the first class we pass in here means
ignore that class but the next class in
the hierarchy if we look at this is
actually what we got here the super here
will call the nit method for the black
bear now the super of the self object
with black bear now is going to be bear
and we'll get to the bear in it so this
is kind of surprising this is one of the
dangers of using multiple inheritance
that it becomes pretty tricky to
understand what some code means</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
