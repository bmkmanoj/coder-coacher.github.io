other domains rather than just input for
instance it can be used to simplify
changes let me illustrate this for
instance it can also be used to simplify
changes to your code when would such a
thing we need well simple situation this
is you and this is your major web
hosting service you're building your
infrastructure on lots and lots of
third-party open source libraries and
since you want to keep your service up
to date with respect to security patches
and everything you have to update these
libraries on regular intervals so you're
getting patches that is large changes to
a code base on regular intervals this is
the same as upgrading the libraries to
the newest version and the changes
between versions that is the patches can
easily contain ten thousands of source
line here comes a new patch h3 also with
tens thousands of source code lines all
of a sudden your infrastructure fails
after applying the patch what is the
cause of the error this is an instance
of a problem that's more generally
called yesterday my program worked today
does not why you change something as a
result of the change something no longer
works and you want to figure out what is
it in that change that makes the program
go wrong again we can use Delta
debugging to simplify this assume the
patch that causes the failure can be
broken down into several sub patches for
instance these ten thousands of changed
lines would be in different locations of
the program and each of these locations
that means a separate place to patch or
a different sub patch the idea would now
be that may be a subset of these sub
patches would already suffice to create
the error in other words we would
simplify the patch to find a minimal
subset of the patch that creates the
failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
