analytics track of your app the next
thing is to programmatically create the
tracker however we want to make sure
that we only have one tracker running
each time our app is running it's
possible to have multiple tracker
objects all sending data to the same
analytics account which would result in
inaccurate data you might end up with
the same hits been counted multiple
times for example let's say the user
goes to the main screen in your app and
presses the what's for dinner button the
app will take them to the show dinner
screen but let's say you've got three
analytics trackers running they'll each
report a hit to analytics for the show
dinner screen and you'll end up with
three screen views being reported when
really you only had one we don't need to
save the tracker in between a pin
vacations but we do need to make sure
that when the app is running we have
only a single tracker instance so to
make sure that the tracker is created
only once for each app invocation we're
going to use the application object it's
really very simple and i'll show you how
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
