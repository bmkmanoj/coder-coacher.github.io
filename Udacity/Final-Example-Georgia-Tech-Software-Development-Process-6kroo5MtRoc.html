examples with a system that you may also
know bash and in case you don't bash is
a UNIX shell written as a free software
replacement for the traditional bourne
shell also called sh so what I'm showing
here is the descriptive architecture of
the command component of - so is the
architecture as implemented of the
command component of bash and the
component is the one here sort of
highlighted in gray and what you can see
here these names are the sub components
of the command component and if you look
at this architecture to design problems
of the component can kind of jump at us
the first one is the lack of cohesion
within the component so if you look here
you can see that only a few connections
exist between the sub components and
having a low cohesion is not only not a
good thing for a design the second thing
that we cannot is the high coupling the
components are stones of connections
with other components that are these
edges that are leaving the components
and going towards other parts of the
system so basically this component has
low cohesion and high coupling which is
exactly the opposite of how a good
design should be given the structure it
is clear that anytime you change this
component you might need to change a
bunch of other components in the system
and of course when changing other
components in the system you might also
need to change the commands component as
well and along similar lines to
understand this component you probably
need to look at many other parts of the
system which is also less than ideal and
one important point here is that with
all these examples I'm not really trying
to criticize any specific system what
I'm trying to show instead is how
complex software architectures can be
and how much they can degrade over time
and this is true for most systems not
just the ones that I showed you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
