the way that we compacted an array of
input elements was to compute the
address for each of the input elements
to be written into the output array and
then we would scatter these input
elements using these scatter addresses
into the output array we've computed for
instance that element 21 would be
scattered by address five into output
location five we're going to have the
same goal here with merge but we're
going to use a different algorithm and
our algorithm is going to rely on both
of the input arrays being sorted so
let's take a little bit of a closer look
so mentally we're gonna think about
assigning one thread per input element
in each of the two sorted lists so in
this example we're going to merge two
sorted sequences of four elements each
so we would launch eight threads each of
which would be responsible for one input
element so the goal of each thread is
just like the compact example to
calculate the position of its element in
the final list and then scatter that
element there so to start with let's
figure out what we're trying to do what
we're going to ask you to do is fill in
the scatter addresses for these two
sorts this is a very useful and common
thing that you need to be able to do as
you're building a parallel algorithm
understanding the scatter pattern that
will let you get to the final answer
since you're going to generate a dense
sorted list of eight elements the
scatter addresses in these eight boxes
are going to be the numbers from 0 to 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
