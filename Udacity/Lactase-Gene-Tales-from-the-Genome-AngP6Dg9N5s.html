about how a genes expression is
regulated so let me get this straight
the main difference between a brain cell
and say a stomach cell is just the
expression of a gene exactly the shiiin
expression pattern is analogous to our
recipe again we're going to be looking
at how a cell decides to add a cup of
sugar versus a tablespoon of sugar
versus no sugar at all well let's go
back to our lactose metabolism example
which the main ingredient is the lactase
gene if we start to all across the human
genome for the lactase gene
we'll find it here on chromosome 2 now
let's zoom in on chromosome 2 just a
little bit and we can see what what we'd
imagine it would look like remember I'm
showing the non duplicated chromosomes
here because this is what they mainly
exist as in the karyotype here we're
looking at the duplicated chromosomes
which is why they look like x's but here
they don't you have two chromosome twos
one for mom one from dad chromosome 2 is
the next the largest chromosome in the
whole genome at approximately 243
million base pairs long the lactase gene
is located approximately halfway along
chromosome 2 remember you've got two
copies one a moms chromosome and one Oh
dad's chromosome if we were to zoom into
this region on chromosome 2 to look
further at the lactase gene we'd see
that it's actually composed of about 17
exons spanning more than 50,000 base
pairs of DNA after transcription and
splicing removing all the introns that
can be found in this gene we're left
with about 6,200 nucleotides of an mRNA
copy of the lactase gene now if we take
a look at that lactase mRNA we'll see
that between the start and the stop
codon including the start and stop codon
we have five thousand seven hundred and
eighty four nucleotides of information
now based on what you've learned so far
I want you to tell me how many amino
acids would be translated by a ribosome
using this mRNA sequence here we have
five thousand seven hundred and eighty
four nucleotides including the start and
stop codons and everything in between if
you need help answering this question
it's probably because you need to go
back and review some material in lesson
three if you think the genetic code will
help you answer this question you can
find in the instructors notes below go
ahead and put your best number answer
