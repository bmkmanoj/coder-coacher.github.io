that Tesla is the most misspelled word
in computer graphics so give it a good
look and think of doubling every letter
that you can when you spell it yes two
L's looks weird to me too but that's how
it works and I forced myself to spell it
correctly the word Tesla is from the
Greek word Tesla which means a small
stone in a mosaic in English breaking an
object into polygons of any sort is
called tessellation in computer graphics
a curved surface is often represented by
triangles by placing points on surface
and connecting these together for
example a geodesic dome is one
tessellation of a sphere such as the
biosphere in Montreal when it comes to
making surfaces the GPU understands only
triangles to draw any polygon we break
that polygon into a set of triangles
this process is naturally called
triangulation usually we use the
existing vertices of the polygon
when performing triangulation the major
rule is that when we add an edge it has
to be entirely inside the polygon
triangulation is particular form of
tessellation here's the same pentagon
tessellated in a fairly arbitrary way
with new vertices added inside the
pentagon and connected together once
upon a time some older graphics hardware
from the 1980s supported objects such as
polygons or even more complex objects
for example in videos first chip the
env1 supported ellipsoid as basic
primitive graphics hardware
manufacturers quickly came to realize
that the triangle is a fine building
block for almost everything we want to
draw for example one problem with a
quadrilateral is that the surface is
poorly defined if all four points are
not in the same plane a triangles three
points are by definition always in the
same plane and so have no such problems
by the way the graphics coprocessor I
used it's develop on in the late-1980s
cost about $35,000 at the time it was
perhaps at best one one-millionth as
fast as the fastest GPUs are nowadays
and only the price of a BMW</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
