around for more than 30 years it used to
be hard-coded into older GPUs from the
early 2000s it's easy to evaluate and
somewhat intuitive to control one
technique worth mentioning with this
reflection model is that you can give
the specular highlight a different color
than the diffuse components for example
if the specular component is given a
white color the object looks more like a
shiny plastic if both the specular and
diffuse components are multiplied by the
same color the material looks more
metallic however this classic reflection
model is not energy balanced you'll
notice as I change the shininess that
the material looks smoother but overall
the amount of light reflected becomes
greater if you think about it this makes
a lot of sense here's the blinn fong
equation again you take n dot H and take
the maximum between that and 0 and then
raise that to the power shininess the
graph of the angle between N and H
versus the specular intensity is like
this clearly the area under the graph
for cosine squared is smaller than for
cosine so the amount of energy coming
from the surface will be less as you
increase the shininess cosine cubed has
even less overall energy as the
shininess goes up the area under the
curve goes down to changes give a better
result one that's both more plausible
and easier to control one idea is to
attenuate the specular term by the
lumber shin fall off in other words just
like diffuse make the specular term drop
off as the angle of the light to the
surface becomes less straight on and da
tell the other idea is to make these
narrow or curves be higher giving them
roughly the same volume in 3d this idea
is captured in the last term as
shininess increases this last term also
increases when combined with the
lambertian term this new equation gives
a reasonably balanced result here's the
original blin Phong equation you can see
with the shininess of 3 its overall much
brighter than a shininess of a hundred
by energy balanced I mean that changing
the shininess does not noticeably change
the amount of energy reflected from the
surface you can see the effect by
running the demo that follows by the way
this demo puts all its shaders inside
the JavaScript program itself if you
want to look at an example of how that's
done using the lambertian NL term also
eliminates a serious problem with
specular fall off you may have noticed
it yourself with the basic blin fog
model here's a view of the model with
the low shininess and the light coming
up from behind it the diffuse term drops
off smoothly but the specular suddenly
drops to zero giving a pretty bad
result by using the lambertian drop off
the specular term now fades properly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
