instruction finally writes its result
this result is 12 we mark now this
instruction as done and the value of 12
will be broadcast under the name of Rob
tool so now these instructions here are
waiting for their inputs and this one
here matches that you know I'm waiting
for Rob to value so it captures it here
this is the first operand that we are
waiting for the second operand was
already there since a while ago so this
instruction which is the Rob for
instruction is no longer waiting for
anything it can actually dispatch in
this cycle 13 and in cycle 14 the fourth
instruction begins executing none of the
other instructions are waiting for Rob
to so this concludes what happens when
we broadcast the value in cycle 13 for
the Rob 2 instruction what now happens
is again in cycle 14 we begin executing
this multiplication and because it has
begun executing in this cycle this
reservation station is already free it
was freed when we dispatch in the
previous cycle so I'm gonna note that
this multiplication of 12 and 13 which
gives us 36 is gonna end up in Rob 4
eventually here but it's not gonna be
done until 10 cycles from cycle 14 so
it's gonna be in cycle 24 that we try to
write the result these two instructions
still are waiting for Rob 4 and Rob 5
instructions and this happens beyond
cycle 14 so in cycles 15 16 etc nothing
really happens in fact not will happen
until we have another broadcast of a
result and the results we will broadcast
eventually are gonna be in 42 and 24 24
comes first so let's see what happens in
cycle 24 in cycle 24 the fourth
instruction will broadcast the result
this is the multiplication here so it
what's going to happen is the value of
36 is going to be broadcast under the
name of Rob for this instruction is
waiting for Rob 4 so it's going to
capture the value of 36 and Mark that we
are no longer waiting for this operand
this is
production actually now doesn't wait for
anything anymore so in cycle 25 the
subtract is gonna start executing
meanwhile our Rob for instruction gets
marked as done basically this value of
36 that was broadcast also gets kind of
deposited here and marked as done in the
Rob and this kind of concludes what
happens with this multiplication
instruction as far as pre commit stuff
is concerned it cannot commit yet again
because it we need all of these to
commit before it can commit so it's
still gonna be at least cycle 43 before
we consider committing anything in the
cycle 24 however the Rob 5 instruction
will be dispatched and it will begin
again executing in cycle 25 so let's
just move to cycle 25</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
