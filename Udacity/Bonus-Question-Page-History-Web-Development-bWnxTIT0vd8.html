bonus problem to this final this is not
required but if you do you'll be
eligible for a higher level of
distinction in the class and again will
enumerate all that in the instructor
comments so this bonus problem you may
have seen this link in the demo I gave
is to add a page history to each page so
this history link implement this so when
we click this history link the URL
changes to underscore history and then
the URL in this case were on the front
page flip to slash and we can see all
the previous versions of a page remember
in the original demo the problem I just
had it's a welcome to final and then I
edited the page to say your task is to
build a wiki I'm just including the
first hundred characters or so of a page
I can click on view of either of these
links to view older versions of the page
this is the most recent version if I
want to edit a page I can still click
Edit
notice how the URL changes to underscore
edit so if I had this other statement
and I click Save you can see the page is
updated and if I were to click on
history you can see that there's a new
version at the top here so this is this
might be a little tricky but for those
of you can figure it out this is this
would be a really good exercise let's go
back to that other URL we were looking
at before new page this was the page we
added in the first part of the
assignment if I were to click history on
this page we can see that this also has
two versions the original version I made
here's a new page and another version
that had some HTML in it now you can see
here of course in the history page the
HTML is escaped and when we view the
HTML is unescape causing it to behave
exactly like HTML we are not going to
test on that because it's up to you to
decide on your wiki whether or not you
want to trust your users not to put on a
bunch of garbage in your page or not you
know that's a that's a decision you can
make as a website owner and we won't
grill you on it but of course editing
the text area forum should escape things
properly if they're in there so they can
be edited properly and that's all we've
got so when you have that working submit
your URL here and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
