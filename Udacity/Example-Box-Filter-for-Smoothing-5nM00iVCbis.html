this let's start applying it to doing
filtering on averaging for images I'm
going to show the simple example using
the classic image of peppers I'm showing
a black and white image 5 by 12 by 512
by 512 image resolution I'm going to
apply a average filter now this time
around I'm not gonna apply a 3 by 3 but
a 21 by 21 neighborhood kernel okay so
that's important to note that we've been
playing around with just by three by
threes but these can be quite big and
that's one of the things I want to show
you here this is a5 512 512 by 512 image
and I'm not gonna apply a kernel that's
21 by 21 this is the output of that
process basically if you notice the
whole image is quite blurry what has
happened really is at each and every
point we've basically replaced the value
by the average of the neighborhood in a
12 by 12 21 by 21 neighborhood now all
of a sudden if you notice all the sharp
edges are gone remember when we looked
at images and the histograms and stuff
like that there are lots of peaks and
valleys and these types of images well
by blurring it using a filter we've
gotten rid of a whole lot of really
sharp Peaks next to each other therefore
this image now looks a little blood also
noticed the edges this is what I was
referring to earlier because what we're
doing is we adding information some of
the information will be lost and in this
case to do a 21 by 21 about 10 pixels
were added on all three sides and of
course the average of this does degrade
information at the edges just to
showcase this the box filter basically
if you were to look at in the same
height map configuration we've looked at
would just be a flat box like this and
I'd have a shape and again in the image
form are the same values across the
whole sub image that we have again this
is a 21 by 21 the intensity is the same
for each and every one of them in this
case I would assume would be you know 1
over 1 over 21 and this would be my kind
of the kernel what it would look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
