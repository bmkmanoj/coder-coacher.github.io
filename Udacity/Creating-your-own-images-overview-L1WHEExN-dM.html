running pre-made images in this case
engine X it's time to learn how to build
our own images is the best practice
we're not building our application with
doctor no instead we're taking a binary
that could have come from our continuous
integration pipeline then we use docker
to package our application as a
container image and do that we'll use a
docker file dr. files are text documents
that contain all of the necessary steps
for building an image from the command
line a docker file when used with the
docker build command automates that
process by executing these command-line
instructions to build the resulting
image let's look at one of ours really
quick aside docker files are always
named docker file that's because when
the doctor build command kicks off the
command that uses our docker file to
create an image it also creates a
context of all the files in our
directory and its sub directories the
build Damien will then search for a file
called docker file although in practice
it's best just start with an empty
directory as context and keep your
docker file there in that directory you
only need to add the files necessary for
building your doctor image okay so let's
pull up our docker file after running
the cat command you can see the entire
docker file for our hello image each
line and a docker file starts with a
command this docker file just uses for
the from maintainer ad and entry point
commands by the way docker files can
have comments and they start with a
pound sign just like bash comments you
can use comments to make your life as a
maintainer easier and to make it easier
for the people trying to decipher your
docker files quick question do you think
Kelsey didn't use comments and writing
this docker file because this is a
really really simple docker file or
because his comments are so profound
that many programmers decide to retire
after reading one you decide moving on
the first command in a docker file is
the from command this tells docker which
base image to build our new image on top
of these days it's always best to use
alpine Linux as your base because it's
small it has a package manager and it
allows you to debug your containers in
production Alpine is also used by
default for all the official docker
images we could optimize and use the
scratch base image which amounts to know
but then you lose the ability to do
basic debugging like pinging from inside
of your container besides if we're using
the same base image docker only has to
pull that once so we're only pulling
that five megabyte cost once per machine
next we have the maintainer command that
just tells us that kelsey is the author
and maintainer of this image following
that you'll see the add command which
takes a file or directories from our
host machine and adds them to the file
system of the container to specify
location in this case we're copying over
the hello bin from our continuous
integration or go build earlier into our
container image finally entry point this
that's our container run is an
executable so when our container starts
it's going to run the hello app there
are more commands you can put into a
docker file and you're probably see some
of them in the wild before our course
this is everything you need to know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
