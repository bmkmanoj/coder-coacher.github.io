really tricky especially if you don't
have a good place to start but it's a
lot easier if you have the help from
someone like a genetic genealogist and
today we're lucky enough to be joined
remotely with CC more a genetic
genealogist hi CeCe hi Matt how are you
I'm doing pretty good uh you know we're
pretty excited to be learning all about
this ancestry and human evolution and
we're really curious at this point you
know what is it that a genetic
genealogist does a genetic genealogist
uses DNA testing in conjunction with
traditional genealogy research in order
to learn more about our roots how far
out do you go in a family structure is a
genetic genealogist are you interested
in you know up to grandparents and maybe
second cousins or do you build out
farther than that do you connect whole
families kind of just give us some idea
of how far out you go well we're
interested in our family trees as far
back as we can go so with why DNA
testing which has been used in genetic
genealogy much longer than autosomal DNA
tests like 23andme we're looking way
back we could be looking back into the
1400s even because as you know the Y
chromosome changes very slowly therefore
a father and son will probably have an
identical Y chromosome and maybe a
grandparent and a great grandparent a
second great-grandfather on that direct
paternal line so we've used these
surname studies to go many many
generations back centuries back with
autosomal DNA we're not looking quite so
far back because of the recombination
however when we first started using
autosomal DNA for genetic genealogy we
were told that it was only going to work
maybe five generations six generations
back and especially with our adoption
DNA research we have proven that it
works much further back we're able to
identify ancestral couples a couple
centuries ago actually in these trees
and the way we do that is for instance
if an adoptee knows nothing about their
biological heritage we would take all of
their family trees of their DNA matches
so everyone who's willing to share at
23andme or family tree DNA or ancestry
DNA
and we would start comparing those trees
looking for commonalities and
intersections among their matches trees
since they don't know anything about
their family tree and if we see a
certain ancestral couple over and over
and over and over we can be pretty sure
that that's probably one of their
ancestors as well and if not their
ancestors certainly in an ancestral line
one of their branches of their family
tree would have that ancestral line in
it and we've used couples very far back
like late 1600s 1700s and been able to
build down to the present time that
takes a lot of work believe me and we
wouldn't just do it with one couple we
would do it with various couples build
their descendants down to the present
and try to see where there's
intersections between the descendants
from those ancestral couples and if we
can do that which we sometimes can we
can sometimes solve these adoption
search cases without a close relative
match if we get second cousin or closer
we can almost always solve it if we're
only working with third cousins fourth
cousins fifth cousins and more distant
it takes a lot more work but it has been
done great Cece has been a pleasure
chatting with you I hope you'll join us
again maybe in the discussion forums for
our course that would be great I'd love
to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
