saw is generalization generalization is
a relationship between a general class
which we normally call a superclass and
the more specific class a class that
refines the superclass and that we
normally call subclass it's also known
as an is a kind of or is a relationship
because we can say that the subclass is
a superclass and it's expressed with the
solid line with a big arrow and at the
end so let's see an example of that in
this case I'm going to indicate two of
these kind of relationships the first
one involving the registration user and
a student and the second one the
registration user and the professor so
basically what we're showing here is a
typical case in which the registration
user is a more general concept than the
student and the professor so both the
student and the professor are
registration users so there is an is a
relationship
the professor is a registration user and
the student is a registration user and
therefore we can indicate that using a
generalization relationship in our class
