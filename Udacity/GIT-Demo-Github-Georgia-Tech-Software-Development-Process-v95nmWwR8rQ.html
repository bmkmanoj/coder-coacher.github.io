beginning of the class we talked with
John about github where github is a git
hosting website and John told you all
about it for this class we will be using
github as our git hosting let's see how
github works in practice and let's see
some of the common features offered by
github this is what we'll do in the
third part of this get demo what I'm
showing here is the github website and
as I said github is a git hosting
website and you can create an account on
github by simply signing up on their
website and because we already have an
account that we're simply gonna sign in
to see what kind of functionality github
offers are we gonna specify our username
and password and as you can see on the
github website you can use this menu up
on the right to create a new repository
or change the account settings let's
click on our user profile and here you
can see some statistics for our user for
example we can see statistic about our
contributions in our repositories so now
if we go to the repositories view we can
create a new repository we can give it a
name that's calling my repo we can
provide the description for the
repository if we want we can initialize
the repository by adding a readme file
and even though we're not doing it right
now
if you can see up here you can also add
a license here on the right and it
allows you to choose from a set of
predefined licenses and you can also add
a git ignore file which in case you
don't know what that is it's a very
convenient file that will automatically
exclude from the repositories file that
should not be added so if you remember
in the lesson we said there are things
that you should not add to the
repositories for example the write files
so here using this menu you can pick the
type of project as well for example Java
project or PHP project or many other
kinds of projects and github will
automatically add that file for you but
let's keep that for now and simply
create our repository and that creates a
repository that contains the readme file
because that's what we decided to do and
it also allows you to edit the readme
file by clicking on it it will bring up
an editor and here you can write you
know for example initial readme for your
project and you can add your commit
message up there and then you can commit
the changes to your readme file the site
also provide
many other features like for example
creating issues poll requests adding and
editing a wiki and also you know
defining other characteristics and
settings for the repository now if we go
to the repository you can see that we
also get the HTTP link for the
repository so this is the URL that you
can use to clone your repository if you
remember with the git clone command
that's the URL that you can specify so
let's try to do that and clone that
repository so we're gonna copy this URL
to do that we're gonna execute git clone
and specify the URL that we just copied
and you can see that the project was
created was cloned locally and if we go
under my repo which is the name of the
repository you can see the the readme
file that we created on github is here
so if we create a new file which we're
going to call a gained new file just to
be clear then we can add it committed
specifying as usual a commit message so
at this point we can push our lot'll
changes to the remote github repository
and because the github repository is
password protected we have to specify
our login and password and of course if
you pass the wrong password github is
not going to let you in so let's try
again let's try to get the password
right this time I'm going to specify
again my login and my passport at this
point that push is successful and my
changes are actually pushed to the
master which is the github repository to
double-check that let's go back to the
github repository and as you can see
that the file that we added new file is
there as expected and of course there's
many more things that you can do on the
github website so I strongly encourage
you to go and try out things but the key
message here is that github is a git
hosting website where you can get an
account and create your remote
repositories</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
