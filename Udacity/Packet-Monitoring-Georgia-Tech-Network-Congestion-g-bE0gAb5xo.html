see the full packet contents or at least
the packet headers that traverse a
particular link common ways of
performing packet monitoring that you
may have tried yourself include TCP dump
ethereal or Wireshark and in some of the
exercises you'll get a chance to explore
packet monitoring with one of these
tools sometimes packet monitoring is
performed using expensive hardware that
can be mounted in servers alongside the
routers that forward traffic through the
network in these cases an optical link
in the network is sometimes split so
that traffic can be both sent along the
network and sent to the monitor even
though packet monitoring sometimes
requires this expensive hardware on very
high speed links what you do when you're
on TCP dump or Wireshark or ethereal is
essentially the same thing your machine
acts as a monitor on the local area
network and if any packets happen to be
sent towards your network interface the
network interface records those packets
now on a switch network you wouldn't see
many packets that weren't destined for
your own mac address but on a network
where there's a lot of traffic being
flooded you might see quite a bit more
traffic destined for an interface that
you're using to monitor so the
advantages of packet monitoring is that
it provides lots of detail you can see
timing information and information in
the packet headers unfortunately a
disadvantage is that it's fairly high
overhead it is very hard to keep up with
high speed links and often requires a
separate monitoring device such as the
monitoring card that we've shown here
what if we are happy with a little less
detail then packet monitoring can
provide but we can't afford its overhead
in that case there is actually another
approach that we can use called flow
monitoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
