the third one you could certainly argue
that there's a better case for the first
one but that would be pretty
disappointing the reason that we trust
this key is not because it's signed by
verisign and in fact it actually is
signed by verisign when we look at that
certificate we see that it is signed it
was issued by verisign and it does have
a certificate signature and we could
verify it against this public key but
that would be verifying it against the
same key that the certificate describes
that's what's called a self-signed
certificate well this doesn't convince
you of anything anyone could generate a
certificate like that in fact you can do
that you can generate one yourself if
you're using a Mac you have openssl
built in and use that to generate your
own self signed certificate but it
doesn't prove anything so the best
answer here is that while we trust it
because we've got it from some trusted
source and we protected it and we know
that it's valid how that works in a web
browser is there's a set of certificates
that are built in you can download more
but you have to be careful if you
download them you need to know that
they're secure if you look in your
browser setttings you can see all the
certificates that are built in and
there's actually quite quite a lot of it
not not all these were always built in
so so all the ones that are listed is
built in were built in they came with a
browser and we can see that there is one
for verisign actually several for
verisign that were built in and these
are trusted only because we think we got
the browser from a trusted source and it
had these certificates built in we can
look at one of these certificates you'll
notice that they're rated as different
classes what it means is mostly that
someone was willing to pay more to
verisign to get a higher class
certificate if you pay more they do a
little more identity checking to say
that you're probably the one who's
asking for the certificate but all the
certificate proves is that verisign
granted it to you and decided that the
person that they granted a certificate
that said I'm google com probably had
some affiliation with Google the higher
the class the more you have to pay and
the more work very soon does to validate
that so if we look at one of these
certificates we can see the root
certificate that's built in this is the
root of trust we're trusting this
because it came in the browser and
you'll notice that these have quite
long expiration dates since these are
used to sign all these other
certificates if they expire all the
certificates they signed would break and
that raises the question of what happens
when there's a bad certificate and there
have been several well-publicized
incidents where verisign or other
certificate authorities accidentally
granted a certificate to someone who
wasn't actually representing the company
that they asked for a certificate from
revocation lists are one way to deal
with that that you can have a list of
well these are signed certificates that
aren't actually valid if those are kept
up to date and the browser always checks
them well then you could have a
certificate be revoked even though it
was signed this is a pretty painful
solution to this problem though requires
always updating this list it means that
the time between update you're
vulnerable if there's a bad certificate
and requires a lot of extra work for the
browser to validate a certificate the
best solution of course would be never
to grant a certificate without
validating that identity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
