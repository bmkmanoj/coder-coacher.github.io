okay
drift is the error that happens that it
accumulates over time that basically
what happens is you've got this dynamic
model that's making a prediction and
you've got its sensor observation model
etc and you're really caught with two
choices okay and both of the choices are
lousy choice one is I stick to my target
model right I really believe the model
and I never change it like it's apparent
so it's called diffusion the problem
with that is what happens if the object
is changing all of a sudden you know it
goes in the trees shadows things look a
little different and I didn't update my
model so almost every tracker does some
form of model update the problem with
that is when you do model update you run
into a situation like this okay so this
was actually taken from the tracking
people paper although this was they were
explaining how not to do tracking so
they've got this little box that's stuck
on the middle of the ice skater and each
time they're updating something about
the description and eventually the box
slides down and what's not shown here is
it might get stuck on the background
markings in the in the rink and so
what's happens you keep changing change
and all of a sudden more of them are of
the target model came from the rink then
came from the skater so as the skater
leaves the model stays right there and
this is the the problem with adaptive
tracking and so all real tracking in
order to fight drift always has this
balance between how quickly or how much
do I change my model versus how much do
I keep what I had from before and you
might ask well how come I didn't see any
of this in all that Bayesian stuff that
you did the reason is I gave you the
sensor model P of Z given X and I really
didn't tell you how it behaves
generically or I should say all the time
I just we in fact all we did was we
generally gave the algorithm P of Z
given X might be how well do I match the
pixels well but if the pixels are
changing I have to change my sensor
model so that's the place in the
algorithm where
notion of how well do I hold on to my
old model versus change it that's the
place where it stays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
