coded photography coded photography is
really going to get us into depths of
trying to now create different ways of
looking at the coded patterns the
aperture in this instance how we can
control it and how can we embed that
information to allow the camera to be
able to see additional bits of
information that will actually allow us
to capture images some of this should
remind you of what we did when we talked
about the light field camera right in
the light field camera we wanted to
capture more information than just the
pixel information on the sensor we
wanted to capture more information about
the light field that would allow us to
now generate newer images so the
question now is can we actually do a lot
of this and again we touched on it a
little bit when we talked about the
light field cameras by controlling this
how can actually capture a novel image
representation that would allow us to do
more than a standard image with we've
looked at how to do this with projector
camera systems for lighting control so
the coated exposure basically kind of
says is we want to be able to control
light that enters a camera in time by
using different types of exposure
controls coded aperture then actually
also impacts how much light goes and
remember aperture is the opening the
size we can control this this one we
control the amount of light goes in
overtime this one we control the amount
of light going by the size of the
aperture of course we can control the
illumination as we know about how to do
with among other things with
controllable projectors we can also do a
lot of control right on the sensor
itself of the camera an example of that
that we have actually kind of scene also
is when we talked about the camera
itself we looked at the bare sensor
which was actually doing coded
information remember the bear sensor
basically was coding how RGB was
captured at the sensor and then allowed
you to read it off with that code itself
helping us figuring out how to get the
right color at the pixel level so coated
photography is basically the concept now
how can we actually learn more about how
we can code these things selves and put
them on the image representation that
will allow us to showcase newer forms of
images we'll see examples of what we
mean about that in a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
