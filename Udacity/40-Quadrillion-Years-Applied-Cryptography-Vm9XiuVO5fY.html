is hard it's supposed to challenge
provide some motivation and see if
anyone can solve it and this particular
challenge was posted in Martin Gardner
scientific america column in an article
that he wrote in August 1977 that was
introducing our essay to a wide audience
the technical paper on our essay was
published shortly after that in 1978 as
part of this article he asked for Ron
Rivest to come up with a challenge and
this was the challenge that was
published in this article that given the
public key and any and here we have n is
129 digit number and the intercepted
ciphertext figure out what the message
was and that can be done by factoring n
and Ron Rivest estimated that factoring
n would take about 40 quadrillion years
and it turned out this was a little bit
off the actual time was 17 without the
quadrillion years and it was shown by a
team led by Derek Atkins in 1994 that
these two numbers multiplied together to
produce the N in the challenge so for
the quiz the question is what does this
mean the fact that Derek Adkins and his
team were able to break n into these two
factors this is kind of a silly quiz but
I hope you'll think about it anyway some
of the answers are more serious than
others it could mean that RSA is
fundamentally broken can mean that the
magic words are squeamish ossifrage it
can mean that RSA keys need to be longer
than 120 nine digits for good security
or it could mean that time flies when
you're factoring so 40 quadrillion years
actually seems like 17</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
