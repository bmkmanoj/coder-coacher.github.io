cybersecurity how is the task of
securing our system is going to be
addressed by us what are the things that
are available to us so one way you can
reduce vulnerability is by basically
following some design principles that
are good for security and when they're
more secure they're fewer
vulnerabilities and less likely to be
compromised
so complexity is always the enemy the
Wells table studies that show whether
it's bugs or performance related things
or whatever it is
those increase with the complexity or
size of lines of code for example so one
way to reduce vulnerabilities is what we
call this economy of mechanism should be
a small set of mechanisms that your
system fundamentally relies on so avoid
complexity keep it simple keep it small
chances are that you're gonna have fewer
well and we'll do that now the design
principle is failsafe defaults failsafe
default always say when somebody may or
may not need access to some sensitive
data you deny it if they really need it
at that point you can allow it so
default should be deny and failsafe
default is that the thing is protected
access is controlled complete mediation
says your system should never allow
someone to bypass that monitor the
monitor has to mediate before and
someone is able to gain access to the
resource idea is that someone who's
there to enforce that accesses are those
allowed by policy you have in place then
you can't bypass it and that's the
complete mediation requirement a lot of
people don't believe that you can get
security by obscurity so if someone says
well we are secure because no one knows
how we do something well don't count on
that or have somebody smart can reverse
engineer and learn most of it so open
design is good because we're not
counting on somebody you're not finding
out how we do things an extremely
important design principle is what's
called lease privilege so in systems at
any time essentially when you running an
application or a program you have the
privilege to be able to access a set of
resources let
Flula says you should only have
privileges for resources that you
absolutely need and nothing more
it's a damage containment idea if
something were to go wrong what you can
harm is the set of resources for which
you hold privileges we said people are
the weak link when it comes to security
and that is because you perhaps expect
people to do something that doesn't come
natural to them so psychological
acceptability says you know don't ask
people to do that doesn't put excessive
burden on them so there are a number of
these design principles actually they
come from a classical paper that is
called design principles for secure
systems you'll have a link to that paper
at least read the design principles
section out of that paper and for each
of these principles we should understand
how does it enhance or improve
