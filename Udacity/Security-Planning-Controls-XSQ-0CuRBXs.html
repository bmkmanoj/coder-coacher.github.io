address this question of what sort of
controls make the most sense you know
given our assets and given our threat
posture and so on so what are some of
these controls so first thing that you
have to worry about is identity and
access management this should come as no
surprise because you've been talking
about authentication that tells us who
is making a request for any kind of
resource we have in the system and then
we have access management so identity
access management is a buzzword you hear
all the time access management basically
says if somebody is making a request for
resource do they have permission to
access that resource so credentialing is
essentially deciding that person is
we're not going to worry about what you
need to show up with to show who you are
and based on that they're going to
create an account for you and they're
going to decide what kind of access
should be granted to you using passwords
then for example you may have password
policies you know how long the password
has to be how frequently it has to be
changed we talked about George tech
policy for example some places may have
multi-factor authentication for example
they may require that you you have a
token in addition to a password and
things like that then we have our assets
we are talking about we have networks
and we have hosts servers and desktops
and so on so we have to have defenses
for those as well so we may have
firewalls who control what comes into
our network or are what I leaves our
network we may have intrusion detection
and prevention systems to to look at the
traffic their network level then look at
network traffic or post activity and so
on and decide if there is something
suspicious that may be going on another
controller solution we may require is
that people have antivirus systems
running on their machines people talk
about their effectiveness and question
how good they are but having this is
there's not going to be one solution
that takes care of everything or one
control that takes care of everything
they all sort of help you increase the
level of assurance as we say that you
are secure and so this we may require
these if people access our system the
networks from outside we may require
that we have a
VPN solution virtual private network
solution if they bring your own devices
that meant necessitate something else we
know that the software we're talking
about systems and controls so the
software we run on our systems may
vulnerabilities may be discovered and
patches may become available and when we
talk about controls I think we're
talking with Sir technological controls
these examples of course password
management or identity management
firewalls and so on sort of look like
those but another control is how do we
educate our users so this could be for
example some sort of periodic thing you
run we've seen many companies for
example to educate their employees so
they don't fall for phishing attacks
monthly or they have these things where
they send you an email and if you fall
for it this is not a real attack this is
sort of use to train and educate you
that you shouldn't be falling for those
kind of things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
