complex we want to ensure that we don't
redo any work that has already been done
the last time we executed our build this
is especially important during
development when we run our builds often
many times a day with just some minor
changes it would be a huge impediment to
the development process if our build had
to start from scratch every time we call
the idea of only doing the minimum
amount of work necessary incremental
builds for example let's consider an
Android application building our app
requires compiling our code generating
source files and packaging static
resources into the final apk if we were
to say change one of our layout files we
don't want to have to compile our code
again that would be unnecessary Gradle
accomplishes this by tracking each tasks
inputs and outputs before each task is
run Gradle saves a snapshot of the
inputs used by the task if that
particular task doesn't have any
snapshots of its input yet or if the
inputs have changed then Gradle will run
the task again Gradle additionally saves
a snapshot of the outputs created by
this task the next time Gradle goes to
run the same task it compares the inputs
to the snapshot at saved earlier if the
inputs match Gradle then also checks the
outputs if the outputs haven't been
messed with since the last time the task
ran then the task can be skipped if the
outputs have changed or are missing then
the task must run again when Gradle
determines that no work needs to be done
and the task can be skipped the task is
said to be up to date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
