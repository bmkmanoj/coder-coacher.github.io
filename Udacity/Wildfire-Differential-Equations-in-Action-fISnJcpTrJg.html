unit 6 and actually the last problem for
our entire course aside from the final
exam at least now you have a chance to
put together all of the information that
we gave you in unit 6 to create a 2-d
wildfire we're going to be looking at a
big grid of forests and seeing how
diffusion heat lost wind and combustion
come together to affect the time
derivative of the temperature as we've
talked about before these four factors
can simply be added together to show how
to change is the time let's look at the
code for a second to figure out what all
we're going to ask you to do here you
can see we've given you a number of
different constants that are going to
help you out a lot one thing that's kind
of a small detail but that might be
interesting to note is that the velocity
due to the wind which we can see right
here is actually very low it's much
lower than the velocity of the wind
itself since the fire is only going to
follow the wind at a fraction of the
winds real speed so as I said earlier
your first task is going to be to take
into account heat diffusion heat loss
wind and combustion in the 2d heat
equation right here fortunately we're
not going to ask you to use the implicit
method that you used in homework 1 you
can just use the explicit method views
before so basically the forward Euler
method an important thing that we need
to deal with in this problem is
spatially varying conditions we must be
careful to not introduce any hard edges
anywhere or they'll probably two
artifacts first from the solver due to
huge values in the derivatives and
second in terms of the model itself we
want to make sure that we don't see any
staircases or pixelated contours really
anything that doesn't look like reality
to help deal with this we've already
included a smooth Gaussian bell shape
for the initial distribution of the
temperature the second thing that you
need to do however is to create an
initial distribution for the wood
density I'll give you a little bit more
information about that right now
remember the grid that we're creating
using the code is basically making a map
of the terrain that we're looking at
this graph right here is going to give
you an idea of what we're looking for in
terms of wood density distribution now
here we have a bunch of lines that are
parallel to one another but slightly
displaced x and y are actually just the
physical coordinates that we're looking
at but the different colors of the
different lines correspond to changes in
the wood density at each location so
every point along the blue line
is going to have the same density of
every other point on that line every
value on this purple line has the same
density and so on and so forth in the
code we created two constants for you
would one and would to which I've
underscores in the code it will be very
clear what they are referring to and
these mark out the highest and lowest
possible values of wood density that we
have in our forest now all of these
lines are parallel to one another and
we've given you the slope in the code
that means that the only factor
differentiating them from one another is
there y intercept if you make a graph of
wood density versus y intercept then we
get something that looks like this you
can see that we're only letting what
density vary between would one and would
too right here another hint that might
be helpful when you're doing this
problem is that you can solve for the y
intercept of given line by saying that
the y intercept equals some Y value
minus the slope times the x value at
that point this is kind of a tricky
problem but remember it's your very last
one before the final if you have any
trouble come to the forums good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
