really only necessary to provide the
nonce but it's helpful to provide the k
value as well and what he needs to check
once this nonces provided be can check
that the encryption using aids public
key of the output which is the Y to
value with the nonce added that was the
part that Alice removed so what Bob
needs to do is check that that output is
equal to X of K and that value was
provided directly to be because all of
the inputs from two links ago went into
this mix as well as the outputs from a
so this proves to be that for the
particular output that be asked for that
that corresponds to one of the inputs to
a and we can do the same thing all the
way down the chain that means that a
will provide its outputs both to be and
CE CE will be able to verify that be do
the mix correctly by picking some random
ones and having be proved that they're
correct and at the final stage B will
provide its outputs to see as well as to
some validator who can validate that
seeded the correct thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
