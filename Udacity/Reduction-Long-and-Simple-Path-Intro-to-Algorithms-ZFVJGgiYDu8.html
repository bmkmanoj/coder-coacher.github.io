problem and we'll call it the long and
simple path decision problem and it goes
like this given a graph G and a length L
and two nodes U and V is there a simple
path from u to V consisting of L or more
nodes so we're not looking for a short
path we're actually looking for a long
and simple path and we're going to
imagine and I'm saying imagine because I
actually don't know whether this is true
or not but we're gonna imagine that
there's an algorithm that solves this
decision problem it says yes or no
correctly and it run and it's running
time is n to the K for some constant K
like - like so big theta of N squared or
10 like big theta of n to the tenth or a
thousand big theta of n to the thousand
but not K is not a function of n so it
can't be an exponential or it's got to
be bounded by some polynomial it could
be a nasty polynomial but let's just
imagine that it's bounded by a
polynomial all right now here's a
different problem find a simple path
from u to V in G consisting of L or more
nodes so this one is just asking the
yes/no question this one's actually
asking for the path we'd like to know is
there a polynomial time solution to this
problem we'll call it problem B assuming
that there is a polynomial time solution
for problem a we can use the solution of
problem a as a subroutine in solving
problem B all right so here's how we'd
like you to do it I want you to write a
Python command called long and simple
path that takes a graph G and node you
node V and a length L and it's allowed
to call long and simple decision with
whatever it wants as many times is it
once as long as it's a polynomial in the
number of nodes and edges in the graph
and ultimately return the path if there
is one so so here's a little skeleton to
get you started we call long and simple
decision g u v l and if it's the case
that that the decision problem says for
the solution to the decision problem
says there is no path of length L or
greater from
viii in G then you don't have to do
anything just return false but otherwise
you actually need to build and return
the path as a as a list of nodes and the
first element of that list should be you
and the last element should be V and all
the steps in between should be actual
edges and the total number of nodes on
that path needs to be at least L</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
