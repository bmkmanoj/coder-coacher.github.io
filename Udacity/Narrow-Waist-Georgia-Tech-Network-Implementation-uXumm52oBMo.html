important fundamental design goal of the
internet interconnection and how
interconnection is achieved with a
design principle called the narrow waist
let's keep in mind that one of the main
goals was to interconnect many existing
networks and to hide the underlying
technology of interconnection from
applications this design goal was
achieved using a principle called the
narrow waist the internet architecture
has many protocols that are layered on
top of one another at the center is an
interconnection protocol called IP or
the internet protocol now every internet
device must speak IP or have an IP stack
given that a device implements the IP
stack it can connect to the Internet
this layer of the network is sometimes
called the network layer now this layer
provides guarantees to the layers above
on top of the network layer sits the
transport layer the transport layer
includes protocols like TCP and UDP the
network layer provides certain
guarantees to the transport layer one of
those guarantees is end-to-end
connectivity for example if a host has
an IP address then the network layer or
IP provides the guarantee that a packet
with that host destination IP address
should reach the destination with the
corresponding address with best effort
on top of the transport layer sits the
application layer the application layer
includes many protocols that various
internet applications use for example
the web uses a protocol called the
hypertext Transfer Protocol or HTTP and
mail uses a protocol called SMTP or
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
transport layer protocols provide
various guarantees to the application
layer including reliable transport or
congestion control now below the network
layer we have other protocols the link
layer provides point-to-point
connectivity or connectivity on a local
area network a common link layer
protocol is Ethernet below that we have
the physical layer which include
protocols such as SONET for optical
networks and so forth the physical layer
is sometimes called layer 1 the link
layer is sometimes called layer 2 and
the network layer is sometimes called
layer 3
we tend to not refer to layers above the
network layer by number the most
critical aspect of this design is that
the network layer essentially only has
one real protocol in use and that's IP
that means that every device on the
network must speak IP but as long as the
device speaks IP it can get on the
Internet this is sometimes called IP
over anything or anything over IP now
the advantage to the narrow waist as I
mentioned is that it's fairly easy to
get a device on the network if it runs
IP but the drawback is that because
every device is running IP it's very
difficult to make any changes at this
layer however people are trying to do so
and later in the course
when we discuss software-defined
networking we will explore how various
changes are being made to both the IP
layer and other layers that surround it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
