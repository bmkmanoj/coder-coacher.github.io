their use in mandatory access control
now we're going to get to a concrete
model this is model that deals with
confidentiality and it was introduced
earlier is the bell and la parilla model
project was where that developed this
model was funded by the Department of
Defense so the kind of labels are going
to talk about are the type we've been
discussing where you have you know
classification and clearance and things
like that a couple of things to keep in
mind here is that confidentially is the
issue here okay we are concerned about
disclosure of information so more
sensitive information we don't want that
to be disclosed to someone who's not
cleared at that level so that's that's
going to be one and since we're talking
about DoD the other thing to keep in
mind is the labels what they're going to
look like as I said DoD means it's going
to assume that information or data
that's contained in files is classified
at you know levels like TS top secret
secret and classified and so on the
second part of a label is compartment or
category that as we said before it
depends you know what is the document
about ok so is it in a chemical or
nuclear or conventional or two kinds or
something like that and the rule for
read says user with label l1 op secret
user for example who's working on let's
say nuclear and conventional so that
would be this user's compartment so user
with label l1 can read document with
label l2 only when l one dominates l2 so
this domination that we defined before
when the label of the the subject or the
user dominates the label of the document
then they're able to read it this is
called the read down rule you can read
documents that are classified at your or
or a level that's below yours okay or
further down from your level so that's
the read down rule it's also called the
simple simple security property because
how about rights because we both need to
need to address both read and write so
user with level l one can write document
with level l2 when l1 is
dominated by l2 this is saying the user
has to be at a level that is lower than
the level at which the document is
classified which means if the user is
secret you can write a top secret
document he cannot write an unclassified
document this is the write-up rule okay
so you can read down but you have to
write up and it's called the star
property so let's just see what's the
sort of rationale for writing up
remember our focus is on confidentiality
or disclosure of information this model
says more sensitive information cannot
flow the information flow control
requirement that we had so more
sensitive information should not flow to
users who are not cleared at that level
it's basically focusing on disclosure it
doesn't say anything about who can write
information isn't it that's sort of an
integrity question and we have to sort
of revisit that perhaps but if i can
write at my level or at a higher level
if i could write at a lower level then
what could go wrong well i may have in
my possession some information that is
more sensitive if i write it into a
document that's at a lower level and
someone who's cleared at a lower level
can in the future come and read that
document which means we would have
information flow from a more sensitive
level to a level we and to a user who
should not have access to that so if you
you can't allow write downs you can
question you know why would an
unclassified user have information that
is top secret but if they did write a
top secret document a top secret user
would read it there is information flow
from you know unclassified to top secret
but that doesn't violate the
confidentiality requirement that we have
so think about a request comes user has
the users label the target is a document
that the user wants to access at its own
label we're going to do this comparison
if the read request is if user is making
a read request then the user label
better dominates the documents level
okay to satisfy the simple security
property or the redound rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
