such as time and money are limited so we
have to be efficient and how we decide
to use them so for example there's only
24 hours in a day and if we decide to
spend one of those hours watching the
latest TV drama we can't use that same
hour to say cook a delicious meal with
friends so this ultimately means that we
should be careful with how we decide to
use that time
similarly the human memory is a limited
resource as well we can only hold so
many things in our head right for
example at a party we have a limit to
the number of new names that we can
remember our mobile devices have memory
of a digital kind and that memory is
fixed and extremely limited compared to
that of a traditional laptop or desktop
computer now memory on our mobile device
is used to store all types of things
such as music text messages photos and
much more now on top of all this that
limited amount of memory must also be
shared across the android operating
system for all the other awesome apps
that we use including our Miwok app as
well so if one of these apps ends up
eating up a lot of memory that can have
a significant impact on running all the
other apps and worst of all that would
negatively affect the overall experience
of the entire device which could lead to
a very frustrating user experience all
this discussion is meant to say that as
developers we must keep in mind that
memory is a limited resource and we need
to create apps that use this memory
efficiently consider the contacts list
app a user may have a thousand names and
phone numbers stored into their contacts
list now if each contact were stored as
text views and a linear layout the phone
would expense a lot of memory creating
storing and displaying a thousand text
views even though maybe not all one
thousand would be shown on the screen at
the same time if a large part of the
system's memory goes into creating and
storing 1,000 contacts then there's not
much left to run other parts of the
phone and this may cause other apps to
stall or not even run at all we want to
be smart about using the memory
resources so our app plays nicely with
other programs on the device now in this
simplification of a contacts app when
the users looking at the list on their
phone they only see five contact on the
screen at a time and anything above or
below the list currently visible on the
screen
doesn't even need to exist because I
would just take up memory resources so
there's no need to create all 1,000 text
views and have them take up memory
especially since the user may never
scroll through the entire list so to
solve this issue we could reuse views
because there's only five to seven
contexts that would ever actually appear
on the screen at the time and so here
the blue rectangle represents the device
screen so notice that only the contacts
that do end up needing to be displayed
can just use one of these pre created
views and when a contact is no longer
visible on the screen then the view can
be used to display information for a
different contact so this strategy is
called view recycling and we can
accomplish this with a combination of a
ListView and adapter so we'll talk more
about the details of this whole viewer
cycling process in more detail in the
next video so the takeaway is to
remember not to abuse your devices
memory remember that our apps run on
devices that have a set amount of memory
that it needs to share with other apps
and functions so if a device is running
several applications at a time and runs
out of memory because maybe your app is
hogging all the resources well the
device will have to stop running all the
other apps in order to free up space now
armed with this knowledge we can all be
good citizens when creating apps for
Android devices by ensuring that they
efficiently minimize the amount of
memory that are using</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
