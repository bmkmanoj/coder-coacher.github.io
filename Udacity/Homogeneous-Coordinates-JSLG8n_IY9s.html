newer coordinate frame and we would
refer to this as the homeowner
homogeneous coordinate system basically
what we want to do is we want actually
take the two dimensions that we have
been looking at before the X Y and the X
prime Y prime and a two-dimensional
matrix M let's start seeing if we can
actually represent this as a three
vector so so far we've looked at x and y
so we want to be able to take this
two-dimensional XY and generate a new
three vector we can basically refer to
this as X Y and the third vector being
one and for just sake of completeness
and what we will do with it next let's
call this a W so what we're basically
doing is we adding a third coordinate to
every two-dimensional point so it what
we did basically is now we're coming up
with XY W and the thing we want to
remember is what basically W implies is
again my two dimensional vector except
that now we are dividing both x and y
with that third point here W now of
course there are certain subtle things
we need to pay attention to here for
example is my simple two-dimensional x
and y I can basically look at this point
here two and one of course just looking
at x1 y1 the values would be 2 1
now just keeping this convention in mind
if I had Omega or W to be 1 this still
makes a reasonable sense
two-one-one applies but then of course
imagine that convert W to 2 then 4 to 2
applies and if I make W be 3 6 3 3
applies so this point now can be
represented by this 3 vector in all
three of these values one thing to note
W cannot be 0 because if you make this 0
x and y also to actually go to infinity
so of course when W is 0 we can refer to
that as an infinite point at this point
0 0 0 is not allowed because we cannot
have 0 over 0 that would be an
indeterminant point but all of a sudden
now we have a lot of strength in our
hands when we actually now create this
new coordinate system the homogeneous
coordinate system with X Y and W let's
see what that biases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
