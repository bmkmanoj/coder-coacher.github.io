there's a lot of similarity between the
tournament algorithm and the the sense
reverse reversing tree algorithm and
also similarity to the MCS algorithm so
let's talk about the difference between
the tree barrier and the tournament
barrier first so the the main difference
is that in the tournament barrier the
spin locations are statically determined
whereas in the tree barrier we saw that
the spin location to dynamically
determined based on who arrives at a
particular node in the valley in the
tree in that algorithm and what that
means in the tournament barrier is there
we can statically assign the spin
location for the processes at every
round of the tournament
and another important difference between
the tournament barrier and the tree
barrier is that there is no need for
affection fee operation because all
that's happening at every level at every
round of the tournament there is
spinning happening and what is spinning
basically reading and there is the
signaling happening what is this this is
just writing so so long as we have
atomic read and write operation in the
multiprocessor that's all we need in
order to implement the tournament
barrier whereas if you recall in the
tree barrier we need a fetch and fee
operation in order to atomically
decrement the count variable so that
doesn't exist in the tournament value
that's that's another good news now what
about the total amount of communication
that is needed well it's exactly similar
because of the tree arrangement as you
go up the tree the amount of
communication that happens is going to
decrease because the tree is getting
pruned as you go towards the root of the
tree and so the amount of communication
in a tournament barrier in terms of
order notation is exactly similar to the
tree barrier it is order log n that's
the amount of communication that is
needed now the other important thing
that that I should mention is that at
every round of the tournament you can
see there is quite a bit of
communication happening in the first
round going up the tree v1 is
communicating with the 0 p3 with p2 and
so on all of these red arrows are
parallel communications that
and potentially take advantage of any
inherent parallelism that exists in the
interconnection network so that's good
news that that all of this communication
can happen in parallel if the
interconnection network allows that kind
of parallelism that can be exploited and
the other important point I want you to
notice is that the tournament barrier
works even if the processor is not a
shared memory machine because all that
you're showing here is a message
communication so p1 p0 waiting for a
message from p1 and so on so all of
these arrows you can think of them as
messages and so even if the processor
the multiprocessor is a cluster but by a
cluster what I mean is a set of
processors in which the only way they
can communicate with one another is
through message passing
there is no shared memory no physical
shared memory and even in that situation
the tournament barrier will work
perfectly fine to implement the barrier
algorithm now let's make a comparison of
tournament to two MCS now because this
tournament is arranged as a tournament
there are only two processes involved in
this communication at any point of time
in parallel so it means that it cannot
exploit the spatial locality that may be
there in the caches if you recall one of
the virtues of the MCS algorithm is that
it could exploit spatial locality and
that is multiple spin variables could be
located in the same cache line and and
the parent for instance could spend on a
spin location to which multiple children
are going to come and indicate that they
are done that's not possible in the
tournament barrier because it is
arranged as a tournament where there are
two players playing against each other
in every match similar to MCS tournament
barrier does not need a fetch and fee
operation so that's good a common good
property of both MCS and tournament
the other important thing where
tournament has an edge over MCS is the
fact that tournament barrier works even
if the processors are in a cluster
meaning it's not a shared memory machine
and it is only a cluster mesh
we're only message-passing is the way
they can communicate with one another
even in the sits that situation you can
implement the tournament value so that's
another good thing now it's a good time
for me to mention to you I've been using
the word cluster what that means is that
the set of nodes in the multiprocessor
they don't physically share memory and
the only way they can communicate with
one another is through message passing
and it's important for you to know this
particular terminology cluster because
clusters have become the workhorses for
data intensive computing today the data
centers and the content distribution
networks we're going to see a lot of
that when we talk about giant scale
services later on in this course and
those environments they all use this
kind of a computation cluster and these
computation clusters employ on the order
of thousand or 10,000 nodes connected
together through an interconnection
network and they can operate as a
parallel machine was only message
passing as the vehicle for communication
among the processors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
