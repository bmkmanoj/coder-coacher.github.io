multiplication that is common especially
in the context of engineering physics
and computer graphics this product is
the cross product the cross product is
very useful in three-dimensional linear
algebra but it does not have a
generalization to higher dimensions
geometrically the cross product of two
vectors V and W is a vector that is
orthogonal to both V and W and has
magnitude magnitude of V times magnitude
of W times sine of theta where theta is
the angle between V and W note that
unlike the dot product the output of a
cross product is a vector not a number
let's look at this definition a bit more
closely notice that if theta is 0 or pi
that is 0 or 180 degrees then the cross
product will have magnitude 0 so in
other words the cross product of two
parallel vectors is the zero vector also
if either V or W is the zero vector then
the cross product will be the zero
vector as well assuming we're not in one
of these degenerate cases notice that
they're in fact two vectors that meet
the geometric description given so far
these vectors are negatives of each
other in order to determine which vector
to use we proceed by the right-hand rule
here's how the right-hand rule works if
the cross product is V cross W imagine
your right thumb pointing in the
direction of V and your right index
finger in the direction of W then extend
your right middle finger and then the
direction it points will be the
direction of the cross W so in this case
it will be pointing up notice that if we
switch the order of the cross product to
W cross V then using the right hand rule
will give us the downward pointing
vector this gives us the equation V
cross W equals the negative of W cross V
because switching the order of
multiplication negates the product we
call the cross product anti commutative
as opposed to the commutative dot
product in which switching the order
does not affect the product a
consequence of this geometric formula
can be seen in the parallelogram spanned
by V and W take the length of the Viera
to be the base of the parallelogram then
the height of the parallelogram is the
length of this segment from the head of
the W arrow to the line spanned by V
perpendicular to V using the
trigonometric identity sine of theta
equals opposite over hypotenuse which is
the so from sohcahtoa we have that the
sine of theta equals the height divided
by the length of W in other words the
length of W times sine of theta equals
the height of the parallelogram
remembering that the area of a
parallelogram is base times height this
means that the area of this
parallelogram is the magnitude of V
times the magnitude of W times sine of
theta in other words it's the length of
V cross W another geometric note is that
the area of this triangle spanned by V
and W is exactly one-half of the area of
the full parallelogram that means the
area of the triangle will be one-half
times the magnitude of the cross product
again all this is great but it's of
little use to us without a practical
formula for the cross product so given
vectors V with coordinates x1 y1 z1 and
W with coordinates x2 y2 z2 here is such
a formula the cross product of V and W
is the vector first coordinate y1 times
e2 minus y2 times e1 second coordinate
it's the negative of the quantity X 1
times z2 minus x2 times u 1 and the
third coordinate is x1 times y2 minus x2
times y1 so for an example if we wanted
to find the cross product of the vectors
V which is 5/3 minus 2 and W which is
minus 1 0 3 then we would compute first
coordinate 3 times 3 minus 0 times
negative 2 second coordinate negative
quantity of 5 times 3 minus negative 1
times negative 2 third coordinate
five times zero minus negative 1 times 3
and that would give us the vector 9
negative 13 3 one way to help confirm
that we did our arithmetic correctly is
by checking that our outcome is
orthogonal to both of our vectors V and
W the dot product of V with the cross
product will be 45 minus 39 plus 6 which
is 0 and then the dot product of W with
the cross product will be negative 9
plus 0 plus 9 which is 0 so our result
is orthogonal to both V and W we can
also use our cross product to find the
area of the parallelogram spanned by V
and W to do this we would take the
magnitude of our cross product which
would be the square root of 9 squared
plus negative 13 squared plus 3 squared
computing this gives us approximately 16
point 0 9 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
