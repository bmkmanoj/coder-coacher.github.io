out the content map together let's start
here in the center personal genetics the
decision to know is personal and you
must provide consent we talk more about
the idea of consent and the social
implications of personal genetic
information in lesson 12 now if we want
to learn more about our personal
genetics the 23 Emmy process starts with
a DNA sample obtained from our saliva
now we can learn more about DNA we
learned about the basics in lesson two
now the DNA sample in saliva is sent to
the lab for DNA extraction and then
there's a step of DNA amplification
after amplification the sample will be
hybridized on a chip and the important
part is this is not sequencing right we
learned that this is not sequencing the
whole genome we're actually screening
for 1 million different snv's or single
nucleotide variants and they're named
individually by their RS ID and together
all these SMBs can represent different
alleles and we learn more about alleles
in lesson 6 in particular but once we
have this information then we're ready
for data assembly and analysis our
results will include information about
traits and ancestry we talked at length
about traits in Lesson one and a bit
more in less than five the types of
traits we can learn about include
monogenic traits which we'll learn more
about in lesson eight complex traits
which we'll learn more about in lesson
nine and even particular traits that
have to do with interactions with drugs
which we'll learn more about in lesson
10 now the information we learn about
our ancestry tracks our maternal line
our paternal line and even family
relationships which we'll learn a bit
more about in lesson 11 and we actually
use the calculation called IBD or
identity by descent to determine some of
these family relationships together
combining information about our ancestry
and traits we get a look at our family
traits which track individual genes
shared by various relatives and we
learned a lot about genes in lessons
three and four I hope you have a new
appreciation for how all the information
we learned about so far is connected and
how it connects into the information
that we're going to learn in the
remaining lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
