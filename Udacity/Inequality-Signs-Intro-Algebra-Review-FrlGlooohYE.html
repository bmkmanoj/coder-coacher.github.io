algebraic equation but it will have an
inequality sign instead of an equal sign
these are the four inequality signs this
inequality sign means less than this one
means less than or equal to this one
means greater than this one means
greater than or equal to so for example
if I were to write x is less than 3
that's what it would look like and in
words it's x is less than 3 if i write
this it means that x is less than or
equal to 3 if i write this it means that
x is greater than three and if i write
this it means that x is greater than or
equal to 3 instead of having just one
solution like an equation the solution
of an inequality is a range of numbers
sometimes an infinitely large range make
sure you have these written down in your
notebook now let's focus on x is less
than 3 which means x is any number that
is less than 3 since there are
infinitely many values for X you will
need to represent the solution set for
this inequality on a number line we will
begin by putting an open circle on three
we're using an open circle to indicate
that three is an end point but not part
of the solution set for the inequality
it's not part of the solution set
because three is not less than three
it's equal to three the next step is to
draw an arrow over the part of the
number line that contains the numbers
that satisfy this inequality so that
means we draw the arrow to the left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
