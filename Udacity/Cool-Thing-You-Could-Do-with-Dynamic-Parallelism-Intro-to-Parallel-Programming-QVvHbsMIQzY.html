good match for this dynamic parallelism
capability so as programmers are
thinking about what techniques to use in
designing the next generation algorithms
what are the things we're dynamic
parallelism is really going to make a
difference for them I guess when I think
about the features that I want to add to
cuda I really want to make it easier to
write the programs you want to write and
dynamic parallelism I think really gives
you much more flexibility in how you
write your code so as well as things
like recursive algorithms which are
extremely difficult without it sometimes
it's just easy to write a program holy
on the GPU for example if I know that my
program is a small iterative loop
launching lots of parallel work it might
be just simply easy to write the whole
thing on the GPU and have might have a
GPU thread control control the whole
thing from scratch so if I'm in a
situation where my memory marshalling
backwards and forwards between CPU and
GPU would be complex or difficult if I
put my whole program on the GPU or my
memories in one place and it's much
easier to write so the first thing the
first kind of problem i would look at is
one which would just be made easier by
keeping all of your code in one place
you may not necessarily go any faster
remember serial execution on the GPU is
slower than serial execution on the cpu
when you're developing code even though
you might be able to get something
working faster if you do a cpu and GPU
combination typically you know as I say
I came from a science background you
don't have six months to tune your code
you've got four weeks before your paper
deadline so the question is not how good
can I get it is how good can I get it in
four weeks before my paper is due and so
if i can give something like dynamic
parallelism which will make it easier to
get as good as you can in four weeks you
might only get to seventy-five percent
of performance in four weeks but if
without it you'd only get to fifty
percent of performance you can do that
much more science in the time you have
available so in spite of the new types
of algorithm that it lets you do and
those are very interesting because it
lets you approach things on the GPU
simply couldn't do before i think the
first step is to say well does this just
make my life easier if it makes your
life easy you can spend your time
focusing on doing the science or the
calculation you need to do rather than
wondering how on
do i program this thing in the first
place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
