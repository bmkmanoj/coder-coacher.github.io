to talk about mitigates exactly the
problem that I mentioned earlier and
that is you want parallelism for
accessing the database because this is
probably one of the slowest link in the
whole processing of requests because
pulling in data from the database is
going to take a lot of time both in
terms of i/o that has to be done through
discs as well as the network
communication to pull in the data into
the container where the processing needs
to happen and for that purpose the
structure that we have here is to push
the business logic as part of this
container in which the servlet and the
presentation logic was there we and the
business logic also and make it a
three-tier software structure here
servlet presentation logic and business
logic and all of the data access is
going to be done through what are called
entity beans as I mentioned earlier
entity beans have persistence
characteristics and in this particular
example I could think of the entity
being as representing one row of the
database so the data access object are
implemented using a whole bunch of
entity beans and you can decide as a
designer whether an entity bean is
responsible for one draw of a database
or maybe for a set of rows of the
database but in any event what we have
done is we have taken the parallelism
that is available in terms of data
access to the database and encoded it
through the entity bean so that there
can be parallel access to the unit of
granularity that we have in terms of
database access so the EJB container now
contains these entity beans so now if a
servlet that is serving a particular
client needs to access some portion of
the database it can form all parallel
requests to these entity beans to as
many entity beans as it wants and all of
those entity beans can work in parallel
on behalf of a single client and pull in
the data that is needed and serve it up
to the business logic
that the business logic can then do its
thing so we are reducing the time for
data access by having this parallel
structure and exploiting the available
concurrency that may be there in terms
of i/o performance and also even if
there are parallel requests those
parallel requests may want access to the
same portion of the database if you
think about the example I gave you of
two different individuals wanting to
make airline reservation for exactly the
same dates with the same set of
constraints then there may be an
opportunity for this entity beam to
cluster the requests coming from several
different and clients and amortize the
access to the database server across
several different clients that are
temporally happening at the same time
and I mentioned entity beans usually are
dealing with persistent state which
means that that persistence has to be
provided at some level to these entity
beans so that persistence has to be
provided to the data access object at
some level which are using these entity
beans it could be done at the level of
individual entity beans which is called
the being managed persistence if the
bean is managing the persistence needs
of the data access object then that is
called being managed persistence or it
could be that the container is providing
that facility in which case the
persistence needs of the data access
object is provided by the container and
and that is called container managed
persistence so these are two different
design choices we can make in this
structure the structure is the same for
the design alternative to that is we're
using entity beans to implement data
access objects and we're deciding the
granularity of the data access object
based on the level of concurrency that
we want in constructing this application
service but within that choice there are
two possibilities again in terms of how
we provide persistence for the data
access object II
by providing it in the entity beam
itself or using the container service to
provide that so this once again points
to opportunities for reuse of facilities
that may be available the same container
manage persistence may be usable for
different types of applications one
application may be an airline
application another application may be a
portal for hotel booking all of those
different applications may be able to
reuse container manage persistence
that's available in the structure so the
pros of this structure is first of all
the concurrency that you can actually
exploit concurrency for data access for
the same client in parallel or even
across different clients by amortized
the data access that may be needed
concurrently for similar services that
are overlapping in terms of data usage
that's the good news there's one con to
this approach and that is because we
moved the business logic into the web
container from the EJB container it
exposes the business logic to the
outside Network we're not confined to
the corporate network but the business
logic is exposed outside the corporate
network in this design alternative so
all the data access code that used to be
in the session being in the previous
structure that I've talked about all the
data access code is now moved into this
entity beam that's how we get the
parallelism in the fact that there are
multiple entity beans that are carrying
the same data access code and they could
be accessing different portions of the
database concurrently resulting in
exploitation of parallelism and reducing
the latency for the business logic to
get all the data it needs from the
database in order to do its work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
