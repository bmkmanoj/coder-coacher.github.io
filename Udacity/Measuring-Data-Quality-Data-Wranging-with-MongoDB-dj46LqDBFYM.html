measures of data quality there are
essentially five measures of data
quality that I'd like to talk about this
is the model we'll use in this course
and regardless of who's talking about
data quality and what labels they apply
to measures of data quality they're
going to fall roughly into these five
categories that we'll talk about so
first let's talk about validity with
validity we're measuring the degree to
which entries in our dataset
conform to what a fine schema or two
other constraints we might have as we
move through this lesson we'll discuss
each of these in more detail here I'm
just going to provide an overview we can
also look at accuracy this is the degree
to which entries conform to gold
standard data what I mean by that is
probably best expressed with an example
so do all street addresses in a data set
that we're cleaning actually exists in
order to test that type of accuracy
question we would need some gold
standard that is some set of data that
we actually trust completeness is pretty
straightforward do we have all the
records we should have while explaining
it it's pretty straightforward
actually measuring completeness is very
difficult thing to do we also want to
look for consistency within our data in
many systems we will have multiple
records that have some overlap in the
data they contain we want to ensure that
there's consistency among the fields
that represent the same data across
systems and finally uniformity this
one's easy
do all our values for distance for
example use the same units is it miles
or is it kilometers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
