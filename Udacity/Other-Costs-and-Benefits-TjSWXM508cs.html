are several other benefits and costs to
be aware of individual skills can be
enhanced by looking at other people's
artifacts there are some evidence to
suggest that lightweight reviews those
involving the author and a couple of
other people doing deaths checking are
more effective in finding defects for
staff our of course this does not mean
that more total defects are detected and
when using them it is more difficult to
collect overall organizational data your
organization is going to have to learn
from trying out various approaches as to
what's the most effective approach
within that organization you should also
be aware of the so-called ego effect
that is the knowledge that an author's
artifact will be reviewed tends to
improve the quality of the delivered
artifact that is if you're going to show
what you're doing to somebody else
you're going to make it better however
there is a danger of damaged eco's when
an author is confronted with his or her
defects collectively there's also what
is called the Big Brother effect in
which stress levels are raised because
people know they are being watched and
measured</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
