related classes now everyone likes
packages particularly on Christmas but
in Java we use them all year long
classes that have one responsibility get
put in one package and classes with a
different responsibilities and a
different one for example you've seen
the package called Java util quite a bit
it contains various utility classes such
as scanner ArrayList arrays random and
so on that's one aspect of packages to
group related classes together there's
another useful aspect the second aspect
has to do with names unfortunately in
real life names aren't always unique
there may be more than one person called
Fred and if you refer to Fred they may
all feel that they are the one that's of
course my last names were invented so
that hopefully the first and last names
are unique now with people that's no
longer the case but with packages and
classes it actually is a package name is
intended to be unique around the entire
world there's only one java.util package
and even though there may be other
packages that have a scanner class java
dot util dot scanner is unique and you
can actually reference in your programs
the scanner class as Java dot util dot
scanner everywhere and say things like
Java dot util dot scanner in equals new
Java dot util dot scanner that's a
little tedious of course which is why
the import statement was invented when
you say import java.util.date scanner
that means that from then on you can
drop the family name and just use the
scanner these two statements then mean
the exact same thing this is the sole
purpose of the import statement to allow
you to use only the class name or the
first name so to speak without having to
use the package name now let me show you
how to use packages in your own code so
let's suppose that you have a class that
you want to put into a package all you
have to do is put this statement
starting with the word package and then
the name of the package on the top of
the source file package names are
supposed to be
unique and most companies use their
domain name written in reverse order
such as calm dog Udacity instead of
Udacity calm because domain names are
guaranteed to be unique maybe you have
your own domain name but if you're not
Udacity in its infinite generosity it
will allow you to use theirs for the
following exercises now when you want to
use this class you do what you've always
done when you import it a class you just
use the import statement and then you
get to use the class in the normal way
now Sara will practice this with you and
you get to reorganize the carpool
