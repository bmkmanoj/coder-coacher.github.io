protection this is of course unprotected
system so an unprotected system is where
there is no level of protection an
example would be the early operating
system for a personal computer called
ms-dos and it had hooks in the system
for preventing mistakes by the user but
there was no real protection so mistake
prevention is not the same as securing a
system that's important to see the
distinction between mistake prevention
and a secure system now let's talk about
the four levels of protection that salsa
identifies in this classic paper the
first level is what he calls
all-or-nothing and example of system
that implemented that would be IBM
vm/370 and most of the time sharing
systems of the 60s and the 70s they had
this all-or-nothing property for example
in the vm/370 each user was given the
illusion as though they have their own
personal system that's why it's called a
virtual machine and the only way they
can interact with one another is by
explicitly doing i/o from one virtual
machine to another virtual machine
that's the all-or-nothing property that
vm/370 had the second level of
protection is what salsa calls
controlled
sharing there is for example having
access lists associated with files so
that an individual if I create a file I
could say my file can be shared by my
students and here are the names of the
students that have access to that file
so that's an access list that you can
associate with information that you
create and give to the system for
safekeeping
that's controlled sharing another level
of protection is what salsa calls user
program sharing controls now this would
be facilities similar to what you find
in UNIX file system today for instance
such as being able to associate
different access
rights for files for different groups of
users in UNIX for instance there are
three levels of protection that you can
associate with a particular file that
you create what is the access right for
the Creator the owner of the file what
is the access right for a group that is
defined and what is the access right for
the rest of the world so there are three
levels of protection that you can
associate to the file and that's an
example of user program sharing controls
another level of protection is having
user defined strings on information for
instance in the military it is often
common to have physical files labeled
with top-secret that has to be opened by
only some privileged set of users
similarly you can associate such strings
on information that you create and store
with the system there's four levels of
protection that I identified here are
not cast in concrete because as the
system evolves as the user community
evolves you need to be able to deal with
the dynamics of use of this information
use of the system so that is another
issue which you can call as a
cross-cutting issue with respect to
these levels of protection for example
how do I change the permissions I've
given to a particular file to a set of
users that I've defined as a group that
can access that file how do I change the
set of users I've included in the access
list what do I do to remove somebody
from the accesses what do I do
to add someone to the access list for
information that I've already created so
all of these are issues that deal with
the dynamics of use of information</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
