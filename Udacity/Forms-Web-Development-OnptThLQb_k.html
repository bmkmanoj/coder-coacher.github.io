forms and how you get data from your
browser to a web server and we're not
going to spend a whole lot of time here
on the sketchpad today so the first
things first is what I want you to do is
is open a text file in your editor of
choice and put some text in it so I'm
just gonna I'm in my editor here and I'm
just going to add some text kind of
standard text
I saved this file as play dot HTML and
the next thing I want you to do is open
this file in your web browser of choice
so what we have here is the text that I
entered in the editor here in the
browser now if we were to go back to the
editor and change something let's change
a word here save it and then go back to
the browser and reload you can see it
live updates so this is a handy way for
kind of playing with an experimenting
with HTML you know in a real browser and
we're going to be doing a fair amount of
this today first thing I wanna teach you
about is HTML forms and the elements
required to make them so we have another
tag called form and it looks like this
and like many HTML tags it has a closing
form we're gonna go back and forth here
but between our editor and our browser
and here while I'm explaining things
ok so let's enter this in our editor
here we are in our editor I'm going to
replace this text with that basic HTML
tag I just showed you form close form ok
there we go we're gonna save this and
we're gonna go back to our browser and
reload the page nothing's there why is
that because we didn't enter any content
let's talk about the content that goes
in an HTML form there are a few things
that can go in here one of which is an
element called input which looks like
this let's enter that in our HTML editor
ok now we go back to our browser and we
reload this aha
now we have an input box and we can type
things in this box
pretty cool huh the input tag can can
take a couple of attributes one of which
is called name and name looks like this
it's like all attributes we have the
actual attribute which in this case is
called name and then the value which
written here in red this can be whatever
we want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
