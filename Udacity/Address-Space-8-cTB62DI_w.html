about isolation transferring control
from user to OS part of the system that
that we have memory where OS code and
data structure is we want to set a dig
deeper into it and really think about
how do we define what data and code a
certain process or application can
access I said one of the jobs the
operating system has is give you
high-level abstractions okay so we don't
talk about particular memory locations
that we happen to have right now but
each process we said sort of can believe
as if it has the whole computer to
itself in particular each process wants
to feel that it has the memory that it
needs where its data and code is going
to go as to itself and actually each
process does have something of that sort
for itself and that's called an address
space address space is sort of a
container it's a sequence of memory
locations it's a collection which is a
sequence of memory locations that define
in a collection of those memory
locations it defines a space and each of
these locations can be addressed so
that's what makes it an address space
okay so each process has an abstraction
of memory that is an address space an
address space actually is going to be
unit of isolation so when we talked
about isolation now we're talking about
sort of isolate what from what else and
we're going to talk about isolating
address space address space completely
defines the data and code that is there
for a given application the data end
code is a desired is going to reside in
a bunch of memory locations and those
memory locations together make up an
address space that belongs to a
particular process or application so
that's why we have to sort of when you
talk about isolation we had to dig
deeper a little bit and think about
address spaces so if a process is
essentially going to think that it has
the memory to itself it's going to think
of this memory as a contiguous set of
locations going from some starting
address 0 to some max and it's going to
think that it has this set of memory
locations not only there are categories
but they could even be more the
a total memory that we have physical
memory that we have in a computer if
you've done your operating systems class
you heard about virtual memory what's
most modern operating systems actually
support virtual memory that could be
more than the physical memory that we
have so address space that we're talking
about for a process is is a contiguous
container of memory okay that can be
addressed which is going from you know
0-2 to some maximum address that we can
have and it doesn't have to be
constrained by the physical amount of
physical memory that we have so the
address space actually usually if it's a
32-bit architecture basically means
addresses in that case are 32-bit long
or it could be a 64-bit architecture in
that case there will be 64-bit long they
go typically from 0 through 2 to the 32
minus 1 or 2 to the 64 minus 1 your
address is a number of bits and based on
that you can have two to the end
different locations that you can address
with that size of an address
we said the address space is a container
for anything that has to be stored in
memory for a process the process has to
fetch instructional data so that
information has to be in memory before
it can execute it ok so we have to
prepare an address space for a process
before it starts execution and we tell
the process here is an address space for
you you can address the location 0
through something and you decide to put
your data and code in these locations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
