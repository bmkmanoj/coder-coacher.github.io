so far what I first introduced to you is
the concept of snapshots of the RAM so
you can look into the machine at any
point in time that a polynomial time
algorithm executes and then you see
exactly what state the RAM is at that
certain point in time so which line of
the program it's executing and also
what's in the memory and I've now also
shown you that we can represent a
snapshot as a boolean formula what that
means is that I've shown you how to
construct a boolean formula so that when
you have a satisfying assignment for
this boolean formula and there can be
many then you can reconstruct this
snapshot from the satisfying assignment
what we also know is the assignment of
the variables for the first boolean
formula so at time point zero and the
reason why we know that is that at the
beginning we know what the machine is
doing because in the memory there's the
input the algorithm starts at the first
line and in the memory where we have the
output and intermediate results there's
nothing in there so here we already know
what the variables are going to be now
why are we doing all this in the end
what we want to show is if we solve sat
for this huge boolean formula that we're
building and we're not done yet
if we solve sat for this formula here
then we want to know what the machine is
actually doing or in other words what we
want to get is a protocol of what the
algorithm here has done so each of the
boolean formulas here represents a
snapshot but now we need to ensure that
they fit together because once the
machine starts out in this snapshot it
will move to the next one and so we must
make sure that if we have an assignment
for the variables here that represents a
snapshot then the snapshot that is
represented here must fit together with
this one so that it's kind of a valid
representation of what the RAM is doing
here and the way we're going to achieve
this is of course more boolean formulas
that we add to the game and to do that I
would like you to think about some
statements for a bit regarding how
snapshots are connected to each other so
what I would like you to tell me is
which of the following statements is
true the first one is on a deterministic
Ram if we know what state that machine
is in at a time point t we can clearly
state what the state will be at time t
plus 1 the second one is I want you to
tell me if
this year were true if instead of a
deterministic RAM we were talking about
a non-deterministic Ram the third one is
a non-deterministic Ram behaves exactly
like a deterministic Ram except when we
use the if-better function and finally
if we use the if-better function there
can be any number of next states so not
one or two not three but basically an
arbitrarily large number of states and
we cannot make any statement about that
so which of the following is true please
check all the boxes where the statements
are true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
