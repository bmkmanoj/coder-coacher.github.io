for the do function so I make a random
choice of the cards and I replace that
card in the deck with the empty string
and I do that once that gives me the
cards left without that one card then if
the action is gathering I add to my
score the number of hens that were in
the yard and there's no more hands left
in the yard if the action was waiting
and a hand shows up then I had that to
the number of hens in the yard and if
the action was waiting and a fox shows
up then whoops I don't anything to my
score and the yard goes down to zero and
I still got those cards left and then if
something went wrong if the strategy
function returned a bad value or
something then I just don't do anything
and I return this state and you were
since we didn't specify what to do
you're free to do what you want in that
case you could have raised an error that
would be a reasonable thing to do but
the easiest is just to return the state
now here's my strategy function I didn't
bother writing out the optimal function
that though you certainly could do that
and what I did his first they said well
we're counting cards we've got to take
advantage of that to some degree and if
there are no Fox is left then we might
as well wait and gather up all the rest
of the chickens so I made sure I did
that and then I tried all possible
values of how long we should wait for
and found that three was the bath so we
wait until there's three then we
gathered them and if there's less than
three then we wait and is this strategy
superior the answer is yes it is by how
much well by almost three points take
five average 29.5 seven and my strategy
average 32.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
