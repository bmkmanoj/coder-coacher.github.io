said that art was invented by someone
tracing the shadow of a person on a cave
wall shadows give a scene more realism
and solidity and objects shadow firmly
establishes its location in relation to
its surroundings rasterization is
focused on triangles rendered from the
eye so we have to work a bit to generate
shadows one popular method of adding
these is called shadow mapping this
algorithm dates way back it was first
described by Lance Williams in 1978 the
idea is to render the scene from the
point of view of the light whatever the
light sees is what gets lit remember our
Firefly with human eyeballs this is
where that answer comes into play if a
light doesn't see a surface that means
the surface isn't shadow in fact this is
exactly how the basic algorithm is done
the scene is rendered from the view of
the light and the distance of the
closest objects is stored at each pixel
because the light has to look in a
particular direction and has a limited
field of view the light source used for
shadow mapping is often a spotlight of
some sort a spotlight can be pointed
direction and has a constrained view of
the world in 3 j/s the only lights
capable of casting shadows are
spotlights and directional lights for
directional lights you specify the
limits of how wide the light extents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
