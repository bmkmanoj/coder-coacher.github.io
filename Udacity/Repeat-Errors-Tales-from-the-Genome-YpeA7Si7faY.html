track of where you are exactly in the
replication machinery inside your cell
has an equally difficult time it
literally slips on these repeat regions
which can cause deletions or additions
of sequence you know I think you're
right I've heard about this before in
psychology there's a disorder where
there's repeats in the CAG yes so that's
called Huntington's disease Huntington's
disease is a neurodegenerative disorder
affecting the brain and eventually
causing death due to an abnormal number
of repeat regions in a gene within your
genome specifically the CAG repeats now
a normal person unaffected by
Huntington's would have around 25 or
possibly fewer CAG repeats but as repeat
errors occur if you get up to 40 or more
CAG repeats then you're going to be
someone who's affected by Huntington's
so having repeats causes slippage in the
first place then having more repeats
will just cause more slippage and more
likely to pass it down to your children
unfortunately that's true and that's
exactly what happened to an individual
named Katherine Moser whose story was
written about in the New York Times at
age 23 miss Moser found out well before
the onset of Huntington's that she had
45 CAG repeats more than her grandfather
had who actually died of Huntington's
it's just a really sad story it's really
unfortunate also because there's
currently no cure for Huntington's all
we can do is treat the symptoms I want
to ask what do you want to know how many
CAG repeats you had and if you were
gonna develop Huntington's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
