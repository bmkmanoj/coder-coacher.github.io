concepts of focal length field of view
and sensor size I discussed the impact
focal length has on how an image is
formed both on the creative sides a
little bit but also on the technical
side as to what you can get in terms of
field of view and focal length also
discuss perspective projection which
allows you to kind of start looking at
objects that are further away or closer
and how that is impacted with focal
lengths a lot of basic material but we
will continue to advance further and see
more details in the next lesson for
example we look at exposure triangle
where we will actually look at aperture
shutter speed and also more information
about the sensor sizes or sensor values
that has perhaps gives us more control
on what the photography processes all
about of course we are looking at this
because we want to try to understand how
we're going to bring them towards
computation again I've listed a couple
of books for you to look at if you're
interested I do use a lot of resources
on the web please look at look them up
more will be available on the website
and again thanks to professor
Christensen who provided us with some
amazing images of the tech tower and
George Tech campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
