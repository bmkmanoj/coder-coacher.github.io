with equations involving exponents so
now let's look at the other side of the
coin equations involving logs have you
ever had a hearing test or maybe you
felt an earthquake or seen a hurricane
all these things are measured using logs
at the end of this section we'll use the
properties that you've learned about
logs and the techniques that we're going
to discuss to compare the intensity of
two different earthquakes in the
equations we're going to look at the
variable which is oftentimes going to be
X will be part of the input to the log
function that means that to access it
we're going to need to use the inverse
of whatever log function we have since
that will undo what the log has done to
the X so what does that actually mean
well before we were using each side of
our equation as the input to a log
function because we had exponents but
now we're going to use each side as the
input to an exponential function so
let's actually do some work with this
equation ln of x equals 10 what base do
you think will be best used for our
exponent since of course we want the
inverse of the natural log</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
