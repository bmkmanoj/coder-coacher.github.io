we treat calls to write specially and
we're careful to notice every call to
write and append to this JavaScript
output variable in the global
environment so let's work it out
together I'll do the first bit and
you'll finish it off we're going to go
back to our JavaScript interpreter and
finish up our handling of write a
special function call well function
calls or expressions so we're in
evaluating expression here's the
abstract syntax tree or the parse tree
for the expression here's the current
environment we need to figure out the
type of the expression we've already
seen how to do bin ops numbers that sort
of thing so the one we really care about
this time is function calls so this is
what we had before a function call has a
name and some actual arguments looks a
bit like this if the function call is my
fun of a + 3 + 4 the function name is my
fun and the arguments are a list of
expressions and we're going to go look
up the function name in the environment
now write as one of those special
functions that users get to call but
they never actually provide a definition
for so we're not going to find it in the
environment our environment lookup
returns none if the function is right
but it also returns none if the function
is just unknown so we'll check for right
specially if so write should have a
single argument so we'll evaluate it
will get the current output that the
user has written through previous calls
to write I'm doing an environment look
up in the current environment instead of
the global environment here's a trick
though remember how environment lookups
work if I don't have it in my pockets i
checked my hotel room i check back home
i asked my parents i look around on the
web i keep going back until eventually i
hit the global environment because we've
specially picked a variable name with a
space in it no one else can possibly
make this variable so even if i'm not in
the global environment I won't have it
my hotel room won't have it my house
won't have it eventually I'll get back
to the global environment which we know
has it because we were careful to put it
in explicitly starting as the empty
string last time so the quiz for you is
to fill in these two blanks we figured
out the output so far and now we want to
update the environment so that
JavaScript output takes on a new value
what
should go in here to make that work out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
