functions that are inverses one another
and also points that lie on them and we
have seen one graph of 2 inverse
functions but I think that it would be
great if we could focus on the graphical
part a little bit more so here I've
drawn for you two functions that we were
working with earlier we started off with
f of X equals 3x minus 1 and we found
its inverse which is f inverse of x
equals one-third times X plus 1 of
course now from the last quiz we also
know that f is the inverse of F inverse
but I'll keep with this notation for now
this is pretty tricky but how are these
lines related to one another I'll give
you some choices to make things a bit
simpler which of these choices properly
completes this sentence the graph of F
inverse is the reflection in the what of
the graph of F your choices are x axis y
axis or the line y equals x think about
what it would look like to reflect f in
each of these lines and then see which
one of those pictures matches the graph
of F inverse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
