are true the third is not true because
encryption is generally faster than
hashing these three are really big
problems with this scheme talk about the
fourth one first we need this key to
decrypt the program that's running on
the server that needs to check passwords
will need this key all the time so
chances are if the password file is
compromised the key is also compromised
because it's available in memory it's
stored in this program or it's readily
accessible because we need it every time
we check a password the solution to this
is that we don't actually need to invert
the password to check its correct all we
need to do is recompute from the entered
password sum function and check that
with what's stored so there's no reason
to have a key here the first reason is
also true that because we're encrypting
the password the output that's the
stored password will reveal the length
the reason that's a bad idea well it
reveals information about the password
it also helps an attacker out tells them
which passwords are short and that helps
the attacker know which ones to try and
break the easy way to fix this is to use
a hash function as well if we use a hash
function this size of the output doesn't
depend on the size of the input so no
matter how long the password is we'll
have the same number of output bits
based on our hash function the second
one's a little more subtle if we just
use the hash function in a
straightforward way we won't save this
problem and this problem is pretty
important if you look at typical
passwords many are the same and the most
popular password at least according to
an analysis of leaked passwords is
123456 if that's your password you
should probably change it out of the 32
million passwords that were leaked so an
analysis of the 32 million passwords
that were leaked by rocky you calm and
they did not store passwords in an
encrypted format so all the actual
passwords were easily revealed the most
popular password was 1 2 3 4 5 6 over
290,000 people use that for their
password that's almost a tenth of a
percent so this is your password you
should probably change it once you start
looking at a set of a few thousand
popular passwords you're covering a
large percentage of users so this first
approach fails on
any accounts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
