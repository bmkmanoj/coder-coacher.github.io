parents have at most two children
this means nodes can have zero one or
two children those children might even
be null but that's okay let's see what
search looks like in a binary tree we
could start off by using any of the
traversal algorithms to go through the
tree because there's no real order to
the elements I need to go through every
single element in the tree if the value
I'm looking for it doesn't exist there
are no cool tricks here so we're stuck
with a linear time search a delete
operation often starts out with a search
since you need to find the node you want
to delete if you're deleting a leaf you
can simply delete it and move on however
if you delete an internal node you'll
suddenly have a gap in the tree if the
node you deleted only has one child you
can actually just take it out move the
child up and attach it to the old nodes
parent if you're trying to get rid of a
node that has two children you have a
few options you could promote the child
up just like you did before of course it
can't always be that easy what if both
children also have two children in the
worst case you'll need to keep
traversing down the de sub tree until
you hit a leaf since there's no real
order requirement here you can just put
the leaf for your deleted node was
without a problem since there's a search
involved and some additional work to
shift around the elements after a
deletion the runtime is linear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
