thing before network diagrams such as
this one are actually where the term the
cloud to mean internet services comes
from the idea is that we don't need to
know what's going on inside this cloud
it's hidden from us all we need to know
is what service were talking to at the
other end and that the network will get
our message all the way from us to them
like if this is us over here with a
chrome web browser and they're over
there with an Apache web server we can
do an HTTP request and get a web page
back even though the network in the
middle doesn't even need to know that
web pages are a thing the ping program
on the other hand is a little unusual
for a network program the message that
it sends called an echo request is
received by the destination systems
operating system in an application
protocol like HTTP or ssh there's a
server program that composes a response
and sends it back but with pain there is
no ping server the echo request just
goes to the operating system on the
receiving end which sends a response
back every operating system that
supports internet access supports ping
as well so regardless of what system
we're using we could ping a system
running any operating system to be
Lennox or Windows or Mac OS or BSD or
something else that's something to keep
in mind is that although ping is simpler
than HTTP HTTP is not based on ping so
let's see what HTTP is built on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
