pseudocode for how you might implement
this API for a linear regression learner
so we define our class as Len read
learner and this first method init with
underscores on either side is the
constructor the constructor is really
easy for the linear regression learner
we actually don't have to do anything
when we instantiate an instance of the
learner so we just use pass which means
do nothing our training method takes an
X and a Y and remember X can be
multi-dimensional and what it's doing it
should take this X data and this Y data
and fit a line to it so it's trying to
find an M and a B so the job of the
trained method is to find that linear
equation or the parameters for that
linear equation M and B so here on the
left hand side we have self dot M which
means the M goes to the local instance
and B to the local instance and you're
allowed to use any number of linear
regression algorithms at your disposal
as part of Syfy and numpy so go Google
and find you know which one you want to
use here and just stuff its output into
M and B finally query is passed in X and
it's supposed to compute the predicted Y
given that X and remember this is
potentially a list of X's and it can
also be multi-dimensional anyways it's
very simple you just multiply that x
times m and add B and return Y boom
that's it in short this is literally how
short your linreg learner can be now the
KNN api is going to look exactly the
same and the reason for that is if we
have the same API we can easily mix and
match and try you know training and
querying with the different algorithms
and see how they compare ok that is it
for regression I'll see you at the next
lesson have a great day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
