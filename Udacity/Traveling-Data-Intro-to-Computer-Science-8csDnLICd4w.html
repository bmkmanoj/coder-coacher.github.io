pretty good there aren't many things
that we deal with where we can think of
them in terms of fractions of the speed
of light and fractions above ten percent
so our data was traveling between
California and Massachusetts at a speed
of about forty three thousand kilometers
per second and most of that time is not
the time on the wire while the data is
traveling on the wires it's traveling
pretty close to the speed of light the
speed of light through optical fiber is
about fifty percent slower than light
travels in a vacuum but what's taking up
most of the time is all the riders that
it had to go through and we saw that
from the traceroute that it went through
about twenty routers so each of those
routers had to take a packet in figure
out where to send it and do all that in
the time that it had to travel across
the country which was 100 milliseconds
total so the average speed going across
the country was one seventh the speed of
light I can show you the Python code to
compute that so we have the distance was
4,300 that's the number of kilometers
between Palo Alto and Cambridge we have
the speed of light which is
approximately 300,000 kilometers per
second and we have the time it took
which since we're using seconds as our
unit for the speed of light we should
put in seconds and so it was 100
milliseconds which is 0.1 seconds and so
I can compute the time it took like to
travel that distance by dividing the
distance by the speed of light and let's
see what that is so if it was traveling
at the speed of light it would take
0.014 seconds to get across the country
which is 14 milliseconds what it
actually took was 100 milliseconds and
if we divide the time it actually took
by the time it would take light to
travel we get 6.97 so it's taking almost
seven times as long as it would take if
it was just light traveling in a vacuum
for that distance if you had a vacuum
between Palo Alto and Cambridge and no
routers and nothing else along the way
well then you can get your packets
across about seven times faster than the
internet actually does not many people
can afford setting up a dedicated vacuum
between the two points they want to
communicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
