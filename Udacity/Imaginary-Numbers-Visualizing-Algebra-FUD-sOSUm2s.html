even roots we can't take the root of a
negative number that's because there's
no number that we can multiply two times
or any even number of times to have a
negative sign we know a negative times a
negative equals a positive number so any
number of two negative signs would
always be a positive so we can't exactly
simplify the square root of negative one
we know it's not equal to negative one
since negative 1 times negative one
really equals positive one and we also
know that the square root of negative
one does not equal positive one since 1
x 1 equals 1 there's no value in the
real number system that gives us the
square root of negative 1 we'll need
something else for this it turns out
that we define it as I an imaginary
number I allows us to take the square
root of negative numbers for example if
I wanted to take the square root of
negative 4 I would split this radical up
into the square root of negative 1 and
the square root of 4 we know that the
square root of 4 is simply too and the
square root of negative 1 really equals
I our imaginary number so we get a
product of 2i for the second one will
have the square root of three times the
square root of negative 1 this number
really represents I so we replace the
square root of negative one with I we
leave the product of any factors in
front of the radical so we'll have i
times the square root of three our final
result and for our last one we'll have
the square root of negative 1 times the
square root of 12 we can simplify the
square root of 12 by breaking it up into
the square root of four times the square
root of three we know the square root of
negative one is really equal to I so we
write that here and then we take the
square root of four which is to we
multiply these two together to get to i
times the square root of three in a lot
of ways we treat I just like a variable
we list it after the product of any
numerical factors but before the radical
sign now that we've seen a couple of
cases of simplifying negative radicals
with I let's see if you have the hang of
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
