precondition there's another one think
for a second and see if you can come up
with one other potential precondition so
for I guess the last requirement you
could be in a situation where someone
continually is trying to check out the
same loanable item over and over again
and one of our quirements states that
you can renew an item up to once but if
there is another outstanding requests
for that item then you shouldn't be
allowed to check it out because other
people may if you wanted to check out
the same thing we're talking about
checking out an item and if you've
already got it checked out and you want
to keep it longer that's a renewal not a
check out okay but clearly we're going
to have to deal with that situation when
we get to the considering renewals okay
so the other one other possibility is
you'd like to check this out but it
turns out that it's the hottest best
seller and there's 44 people before you
in the list of requests okay okay so
even though you happen to find it
because we just put back okay it was put
back by mistake and they're not going to
let you check it out because somebody
else has requested it so the request
queue needs to be empty so to speak for
you to be able to well almost how about
if you're the person that requested it
if you're the first person i requested
then the precondition should hold and
right right so it's not it's not an
empty queue it could be a queue with one
thing in it or a queue actually with any
number of things in as long as your top
on the list okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
