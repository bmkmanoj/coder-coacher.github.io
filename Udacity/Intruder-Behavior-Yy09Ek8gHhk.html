intruders are constantly shifting in
order to exploit newly discovered
weaknesses and to evade detection and
countermeasures
however intruders typically use steps
from a common attack methodology here
are the common attack steps the first
step is target acquisition and
information gathering that is the
attacker identifies the target systems
using publicly available information
both technical and non-technical and use
network tools to analyze target
resources for example the attackers can
find out what network services are
accessible from the internet and the
attacker may find out some email
accounts of high-level company
executives the second step is initial
access this is accomplished by
exploiting a remote network
vulnerability for example a network
service has a buffer overflow
vulnerability that allows a remote
attack to take over the service and gain
access to a system oh this can be
accomplished by social engineering
whereby for example an attacker can send
an email to a company executive with an
attachment so that when the attachment
is clicked a malware is installed on the
system the third step is privilege
escalation this is taken after the
initial access and the attacker would
try to use local exploit to escalate the
privilege from for example the normal
user to root privilege on the target
system the fourth step is information
gathering or system exploit that is
after an attacker has gained sufficient
privilege on a system he can then find
out more about the network and
organization and even moved to another's
target system to further the exploit on
the network the fifth step is
maintaining access this is important
because an attack may not be a one-time
action that is the attacker may choose
to come back from time to time or
continue the exploit for a while
therefore the
Hammond's door back doors or other
malicious software on a target system so
that he can continue to access this
target system
lastly the attacker wants to cover his
tracks
for example the attacker can disable or
even added the system audit logs to
remove evidence of attack activities or
the attacker may install rockets to hide
the installed malware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
