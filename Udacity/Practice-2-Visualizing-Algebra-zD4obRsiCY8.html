correct answer let's review the steps
and see how we got that answer when you
want to replace the variables with their
values remember to use parentheses after
i substitute negative 2 and 4 x 2 1 for
y and negative 3 and 4 z this is what i
get 4 times negative 2 to the second
power negative 2 times negative 3 plus 3
times negative 2 times 2 squared times
negative 3 once again we need to use
order of operations to evaluate this
expression first I want to evaluate my
exponents or my powers I have two
exponents I have 2 squared here and i
have negative 2 squared here negative 2
squared is negative 2 times negative 2
which is for remember to copy down the
rest of the operations that you haven't
performed whenever you're doing order of
operations I also be evaluated 2 squared
and gave me for now that there's no
exponents in my expression I can perform
my multiplication and division in order
from left to right first I have 4 times
4 which is 16 and I have negative 2
times negative 3 which is positive 6 now
i can multiply these four numbers
together feel free to get out your
calculator now that I've performed all
of the multiplication and division I can
go to addition and subtraction once
again I do everything in order from left
to right 16 plus 6 is 22 plus 72 gives
us 94 if you're having difficulty feel
free to go back and review some of the
videos and try again if you feel
comfortable with the material let's move
