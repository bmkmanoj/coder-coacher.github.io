use parentheses to control ambiguity
here I've taken our expression grammar
from before and updated it with a new
rewrite rule now expression can be
replaced by open parentheses expression
closed parentheses this should totally
remind us of the P goes to open p closed
rule from before for balanced
parentheses and it's going to behave
mostly the same way with this new
grammar both of these utterances open
one minus two plus three and one- open
two plus three close both of them are in
the language of this grammar however
while both of these are okay so is this
one it doesn't forbid the ambiguous one
it just allows us to have more precise
renditions so we've solved some of the
problem if we're thinking ahead we can
use parentheses but we're still allowing
ambiguous phrasing here I've drawn our
favorite utterance from before 1 minus 2
plus 3 and I've written out to different
parse trees for it this one corresponds
to 1 minus 2 plus 3 at the top level
we're subtracting and then the two plus
three are grouped together this one
corresponds to 1 minus 2 plus 3 at the
top level we're adding and the 1-2 is
grouped together formerly we say that a
grammar is ambiguous if there's at least
one string in it one minus two plus
three and that single string has more
than one parse tree here I've drawn very
stylized versions of the parse trees if
you can find even one string for which
this is true officially the whole
grammar is ambiguous</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
