workflow first off you change your code
or you edit it inside a text editor once
you're happy and you want to see what
happened you save very simple I
recommend using a keyboard shortcut like
these which is command S on a Mac or
ctrl s on a PC this will make your life
a lot easier instead of going up to the
menu and clicking one of these options
then you swap over to your browser you
open the file if you haven't done it yet
but if it is already open all you need
to do is then click refresh to see the
changes here let me show you an example
from start to finish first off I have my
text editor open and I also have my
browser open it's kind of nice to have
the two open at the same time so you can
see everything that's going on but you
don't have to inside my text editor I've
made a change notice that I added an h2
tag which is going to be another heading
tag just a little bit smaller than the
h1 I'll go ahead and save it and notice
here inside Adam that little dot
disappears so now I know my file has
been saved I use the keyboard shortcut
because that's a lot faster now I'm
ready to see how this file looks so I'll
come over to Chrome and I will press
command o to open a file I will navigate
through my computer and then find it
I've called it a lesson 2.8 GML and I'll
click open
hey and there you go you can see the
header here and it's the same code
that's over here that's pretty cool so
what if I make a change what if I decide
to change this exclamation point to a
question mark because for some reason
I'm not sure it is up I know this is
HTML I'll save it and then I'll come
over to the browser and I'll refresh now
I could click this refresh button here
but it's actually a lot faster to use
the keyboard shortcut so I'll hit
command R and now there is a question
mark alright and that's all there is to
it there are a few other ways of opening
files in the browser but this is going
to be what you'll be doing for now later
on you'll actually learn about a few
tools that can do the refreshing for you
every time you save that
pretty cool and then there are also
developer tools that will let you edit
websites live without even using a text
editor you'll be learning about
developer tools very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
