to our newest coffee break I'm Sean
Bennett of course architect at Udacity
Peter lubbers some program manager and
the google chrome developer relations
team and we're here to talk to you about
the latest course we've been working on
mobile web development yep so we got to
get her in and started working on this
mobile web development course really
teaching all the best practices that you
need to know in for modern-day web
development I guess a lot of people
might be asking why are we making this
course like is it isn't this material
available elsewhere why is it important
to design for mobile web that's right I
I really think there isn't and that's
that's partially why we're really so
excited about doing this because there's
a lot of best practices a lot of
information out there but it's in blog
post it's in maybe certain documents on
html5 rocks or an md n but it isn't
really a complete training course that
takes you into end using sample code
that we built as a completely separate
mobile web application for the majority
of the samples so right that's pretty
that's pretty cutting edge yeah right
and we go over a lot of different
concepts we start with just basic design
philosophy how does mobile differ from
the desktop which is actually pretty
huge and most people don't really
understand that I think and then we go
into a lot of responsive layout and
other performance issues yeah that's the
the thing I'm really excited about we're
building in performance as a feature
from the start so we're not just saying
okay let's build all this in a last
lesson we go back and say oh yeah now
it's actually pretty slow let's just
let's take a look at that we're building
it in from the start and to do that we
actually show you how to use the right
tools as well so we give you pointers on
the general tool set up for mobile web
development which is a little different
from what your may be used to because of
the device testing but then also we we
jump into each specific lesson we'll
have like well here's another couple
tips that you might need to know in the
developer test right
a few pro tips spread out here in there
so there are all sorts of features that
were really excited about all sorts of
material that we're really hoping to to
teach really well and in one single
place we're hoping that all of you are
excited to learn about it so with that I
think it's time that we get back we're
going to go back to work yeah thanks for
the healthier</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
