your intuition to read through some
if-else statements you figured out what
different messages would be printed to
the logs based on certain conditions now
let's look into these statements more
formally if-else statements are called
control flow statements it's named this
way because instead of a linear flow of
code where one line of code is being
executed after another the control flow
statement actually allows us to jump to
different parts of the code based on
certain conditions so if this condition
is true meaning the boolean variable was
set to true up here somewhere then these
statements will be executed and it will
skip this block of code if this
condition is false then we execute these
lines of code and then resume the normal
linear flow of code after that looking
at our vocab word glossary we can look
up the phrase if-else statement one way
to think about this is to use an analogy
of a train track a train track has a
switch so that given a certain condition
the train will go one way or the other
similarly in the if-else statement if
this condition is true then we'll
execute one path of code if the
statement is false then we'll execute a
different path of code and then
afterwards we're going to resume the
normal flow of code the if statement is
the simplest control flow statement
notice this syntax here we start with
the word if and then we have parentheses
around the condition and then we have an
opening brace and then a closing brace
at the end of the if block of code in
this example of a Pizza ordering app if
the user wants the order to be delivered
to their home then we're going to adjust
the price to add five extra dollars for
the delivery charge otherwise if the
order is not for delivery then we just
skip the sign of code and we don't add
the extra charge for delivery then in
these subsequent lines of code we can
use the total price variable with the
correct value now the if-else statement
is a little more advanced if the
condition in the parentheses is true
then we execute these lines of code then
we skip this and then continue with the
rest of the code so in this game app if
the user has zero points then we're
going to update the textview to say
loser and we're going to update the
imageview to be a sad face however if
the condition
false the person has for example 100
points then we're gonna skip this block
of code and we're going to go down here
to the else case we're gonna update the
textview to show the word winner and
then we're gonna update the image view
to show a happy face then we're going to
continue with these lines of code here
as you can see the code inside the if
statement can contain as many lines of
code as we want similarly with the else
statement if we want more than two
possible code paths we can use an else
if statement you can have as many
else--if blocks as you want and then you
could just end with an else at the very
end but again all these else if and else
blocks are optional in our code here we
can fall into one of three possible
cases depending on the value of the
integer variable item count item count
just represents the number of items in
the shopping cart in our app let's start
with the first condition if item count
is 12
then 12 is greater than 10 so that is
true and then we would execute the lines
of code within this block of code we
would create a toast message that says
you get 20% off and show it at the
bottom of the screen since we fell into
this case then we skip this block and
this block and then we continue with the
rest of the code
what would happen if the shopping cart
only had two items in it well then item
count would not be greater than 10 so
this would be false and we would skip
this block of code here and then jump
down to the else if statement then we
would check if 2 is greater than 0 and
it is so then we would fall into this
case we would show a toast message that
says thank you since we fell into this
case we're going to skip this one and
then we can continue with the rest of
the code and lastly if our shopping cart
had zero items then this condition would
be false because 0 is not greater than
10 this condition would be false because
0 is not greater than 0 and then we
would fall into this else case here and
we would show a message that says you
have an empty cart if you ever need a
reminder of the syntax of any of these
statements you can just check the
official Java documentation it tells you
about the if statement and here's an
example and then it also shows you the
if-else statement and here's the example
and lastly there's an example with else
if statements based on everything that
I've shown you so far you're probably
realizing
that Java has a special use for the
words if and else their Java keywords
and they're used to control how the code
is executed so you can't use these as
variable names from the examples that I
showed you you also may have started to
realize that we put different
expressions in this test condition here
any expression is valid as long as it
valuates to true or false so we can put
a boolean variable in the test condition
or for example we can compare two values
we can compare two values using any of
these equality and relational operators
we can test that two integers are equal
to each other or not equal to each other
or greater or less than equal to each
other and here are examples of different
test conditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
