population of everyone that took the BBC
test you guys are a sample there are a
lot of different samples we could take
of all the people that took the test we
can take big samples and small samples
and while your sample could get the same
averages as those from the entire
population there will also be samples
that don't have the same averages the
average memory score of the population
is called a population parameter and
it's denoted by mu it's a funny little
Greek symbol and the average for the
sample is called a sample statistic and
we generally denote it by X bar and X
with a bar on top now I want to stress
please don't be nervous about symbols I
know a lot of people get pretty nervous
when they see symbols that they haven't
seen before but in mathematics we really
need symbols to illustrate our points
think of it like when you're playing a
musical instrument and you have sheet
music how else are we going to make sure
that people and future generations learn
these classical melodies sheet music is
the best way to do that and same with in
mathematics when we use symbols we need
to be able to articulate our thoughts to
other people all around the world and
that's one thing that's really cool
about mathematics it's a universal
language so don't worry you'll soon
become familiar with these symbols
because we're going to use them
throughout this course now we can use
this sample statistic to approximate the
population parameter but generally they
won't be exactly the same the difference
between these two is called the sampling
error which means we can make educated
guesses about population parameters
using sample statistics but we probably
won't be 100% accurate that's why it's
really important to have a good sample
that can better predict the population
parameter so going back to the quiz no
we don't think that the average scores
for this class will be exactly the same
but it'll probably come close and we're
going to
be able to see that later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
