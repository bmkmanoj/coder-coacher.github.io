is called tone mapping tone mapping is
an attempt to be able to take an image
and high radiance image like the one we
talked about the radiance map and
converting it to a space where we can
now actually visualize it so what basic
thing we need to do is we want to map
one set of colors to another in a
reduced space and we want to basically
account for being able to display it on
a medium that has a limited dynamic
range so again even displays actually
are built the same way as sensors they
could we should actually be able to go
from 0 to 255 we want to be able to
dynamically and get the colors in a
space that our display can show it and
again as a set of printer and variety of
things exist on this kind of technology
and of course we want to be able to
display these things on printers
monitors and projectors this is
primarily to address the fact that
printers and most of the displays right
now are inadequate in terms of how they
can represent it now of course these
days with 4k displays and all that kind
of stuff we can actually really display
a lot of high dynamic range information
but of course the content for those
types of displays is hard so tone
mapping addresses the problem of being
able to get this contrast reduction from
the scene radiance image which is
captured in the irradiance map to a
displayable range it preserves the image
details and color appearance because
remember what we did with an HDR process
was really capture the radiance map from
a scene but we can't display it so we
want to do is basically convert it into
a form and that's what tone mapping does
many many well-known algorithms are
existing for this kind of an approach
we'll be discussing some of them in
detail in this class also and I just
list a few of them I encourage you to
look at them now before we go on there's
one thing I wanted to add if you look at
this image I actually get bothered by
both tone mapping and HDR on the web a
lot sometimes and this is one of the
perhaps most overused imaging technology
out there on the internet these days and
people are actually generating images
that to me look ghostly so this image of
course is capturing all of the detail
but with the clouds and all that kind of
unnatural lighting and actually feels
unnatural in fact the scene would never
have been naturally dead like this
so that's one of my problems with doing
over you know usage of things like HDR
is we are actually generating a lot of
images that don't look natural anymore
so my recommendation use it carefully
hopefully you like the example I showed
you here is another example of a similar
type of an image I mean yes it's a dark
image it's nice image it looks artistic
but even in the most natural situations
you would not have seen lighting like
this in a square a popular square
wherever you are so what we're really
doing with our tone mapping for high
dynamic range images is taking again
this whole dynamic range which is shown
here in the real world and what we want
to do is squish the whole range into a 0
to 255 and in essence that's what tone
mapping does it takes the whole range
and based on the display characteristics
and perhaps or a few things that I want
to emphasize it compacts it out into
this range so yes you do lose
information but if you save the radiance
map you already have that information
that you can use later the things that
it does it basically takes the limited
contrast information and maps it to the
medium display medium that you're using
and preserves details again we'll be
covering a little bit more of dawn
