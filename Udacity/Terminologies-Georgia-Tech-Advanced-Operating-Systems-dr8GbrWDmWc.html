identified by salsa in her seminal paper
from 1975 that talks about the issues in
computer security the first issue that
is identified is when to release
information in this day and age we all
know the importance of privacy of
information and there is a distinction
between privacy of information and
security privacy has to do with when as
individuals we expect to release
information or prevent information from
being released
that's the individuals right and
responsibility in terms of information
that they own security on the other hand
is dealing with how to make sure that
the system is respecting the guarantees
that the user needs both in terms of
privacy of information as well as when
they want to release information so said
differently privacy is more concerning
the individual and the information that
they own they possess how that
information is protected and released
when and if an individual wants to
release information security on the
other hand is a system function the
system is guaranteeing certain
properties about information that it is
preserving on behalf of the user
community and in particular the system
has to protect information that belongs
to individuals and ensure that those
information is released only when the
individual that owns that information
wants it to be released so in this sense
there's an obligation for the system to
ensure that users of the system are
authenticated meaning that if I go to
the system and want to access some
information the system has to ensure
that I am Who I am
that's authentication and then it also
has to make sure that whatever
information
I have access to is something that is
not violating any privacy of other
individuals that may have put
information into the system so
protection and authentication go hand in
hand in building a secure system
this also identifies a comprehensive set
of security concerns the first security
concern is unauthorized information
release if I have put some information
into the system then it is a
responsibility of the system to make
sure that the information that I've put
in is not released without my
authorization as the owner of the
information so that is the first concern
the second concern is an authorized
modification of information I may have
released it for a certain set of users
to access information that I put into
the system but I may not have given
authority for them to modify the
information so unauthorized modification
of information if the second set of
concern the third security concern is
unauthorized denial of use what that
means is if I've given authority to a
set of users that they can access my
information there should be nothing that
prevents that set of authorized users
from being able to access that
information so that is what this
unauthorized denial of use is concerned
about and you may be much more familiar
with the term denial of service that's
exactly what this particular concern is
all about in fact this is the first
mention in the literature of denial of
service attacks on a server that
prevents authorized users from being
able to get service from the system so
what should be the goal of a secure
system well the goal of a secure system
should be to make sure that all such
violations do not occur that is
preventing all violations is the concern
of a secure system but unfortunately
stated this way it's a negative
statement preventing all violations
that's ensuring that the system is
somehow secure proof meaning that nobody
can attack the system so it's a negative
statement and because it's a negative
statement it's hard to achieve it sort
of like saying there are no bugs in my
program there is no way to prove that a
program has no bugs and in a similar
manner there is no way to absolutely
assure that the system prevents all
violations
so what Salter argues is the goal of a
secure system should not be stated
negatively but positively if the goal of
a secure system is stated in this
negative manner that it has to prevent
all violations at best it can give a
false sense of security because there is
no way to assure that bad guys are not
going to break into the system so making
a statement like my system prevents all
violation is giving a false sense of
security because it is not achievable in
practice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
