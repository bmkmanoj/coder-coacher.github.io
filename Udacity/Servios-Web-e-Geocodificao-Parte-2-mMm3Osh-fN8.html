long coordinates but whoever knows those
a really important feature in the Google
Maps API s is the ability to go back and
forth between lat Long's and places like
the happiest place on earth this is
called geocoding taking an address and
getting the lat/long and reverse
geocoding getting the address or place
from a lot long will test out using the
geocoding API via HTTP request to get a
lat long back from an address I copied
this request right from our developer
sites all of the requests start out in
the same namespace and then specify the
service and the output format in either
JSON or XML we then specify the input
parameters the required parameters here
are only the address and your API key we
can also optionally include things such
as a component restriction to limit the
results to a city or country or region
bias to tell the geocode or that certain
regions are better than others for the
results that you expect let's execute
this and see what we get back okay at
the highest level we get back a few
things here the first thing that we'll
look at is the status this tells us
whether our request was successful and
is also largely shared between the
various web services there are several
possibilities that we can see okay means
it found what are more results so that's
the lonely one invalid request means
something wasn't right in our request
unknown error usually means there's some
kind of error on the server and the
request can be repeated until it's
successful we'll talk later about over
query limit errors and also request
denied errors so don't worry about those
yet the address components section has
information broken down into things such
as Street Town neighborhood country
state etc we also get a formatted
address that we can use on its own the
geometry contains the lat/long of the
actual location and other important info
and finally we get a place ID which is
another unique identifier for any place
ranging from a whole country
be down to the granularity of a single
address we'll use that in conjunction
with the places API later in the course
right now we're interested in the
geometry so let's focus on that this
location is the lat/long that we're
looking for the location type is also
very important this tells us more about
the point that we got back since this is
a rooftop it means we got an exact match
for our location other values could be
range interpolated which means that the
geocode approximated a point based on
surrounding points or geometric Center
which means that we got the center of a
line for example if we had searched only
for a road without an address we would
get the center of that road let's take
another look at the address components
if we had done reverse geocoding for
example and specified a lat long in our
request instead of an address we'd be
looking for this data we can get the
exact street address or we can pull out
other useful things like for example the
county or that this address is on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan typically
the components contain more information
than the formatted address so if you
needed the detailed information you'd
need to parse through them the link in
the instructor notes has some detailed
info on all the address components
before we go back and improve our
listings app let's review some stuff
about the HTTP requests and responses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
