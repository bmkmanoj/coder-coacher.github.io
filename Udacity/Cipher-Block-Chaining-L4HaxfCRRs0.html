a large message is CBC it stands for
cipher block chaining in CBC the input
to the encryption algorithm is the
result of X oaring the previous
ciphertext block and the current
plaintext block to encrypt the first
plaintext block we use a so called IV
stands for initialization vector and we
XOR IV with the plaintext block and give
the input to the encryption process to
produce the first cipher text block and
then the first time text block is used
to XOR with the second plane this block
as input to the encryption process to
produce the second ciphertext block and
so on so forth again in CBC the current
ciphertext block depends not only on the
current plaintext block but also the
previous ciphertext block which in turn
depends on not only the previous print X
block but also the server text block
prior to that in other words in code
analysis it is very hard to figure out
the plaintext block just looking at the
current ciphertext block more
importantly if two plaintext blocks are
exactly the same meaning that they
repeat in the same message or in two
different messages the ciphertext blocks
are not likely to be the same in
addition if an attacker attempts to swap
in a different ciphertext block or
rearrange the orders of the sub text
blocks the server text is not going to
decrypt properly into the plaintext
here's how the cushion in CBC works a
server text block is decrypted and then
the result is ex old with the previous
ciphertext block to produce the current
plaintext block for the first ciphertext
block after decryption the result is XOR
with IV to produce the first plaintext
block
therefore the IV must be known to both
the sender and receiver</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
