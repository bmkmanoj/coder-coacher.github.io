object to provide different privilege
levels to different clients for instance
if you have a file server the file
server may have different access
privileges to different classes of users
and in order to facilitate that kind of
a differential invocation of objects the
security model that spring provides is
via what is called a front object so
this is the underlying object and an
underlying object may have a front
object that is completely outside of the
spring semantics for object invocation
the connection between the front object
and the underlying object is entirely
within the purview of the implementer of
the service in other words this
connection is not through the door
mechanism that I told you about that
spring system provides you so all that
the client domain is going to be able to
do is access this front object and the
front object will register the door for
accessing it with the nucleus so that
the client can go through this door to
the front object and the front object is
the one that is going to then check the
access control list ECL in order to see
what kind of privileges this client
domain has in order to make an
invocation on the underlying object and
it is possible to have multiple front
objects to the underlying objects with
distinct doors registered with a nucleus
for different implementation of control
policies that you want for a particular
service so in other words the policies
that you want for accessing the services
available in an underlying object can be
implemented in this front object or
different instances of this front object
depending on how many different control
policies you want so when a client
invocation comes in through this door to
the front object the ACL the access
control list is checked before allowing
this invocation to actually go through
to the underlying object as I mentioned
earlier if this client domain has access
to an invocation entry point in a server
that is it has access to a door
the client domain can pass this around
because the software capability in the
software capability can be passed around
by the client domain to other domains in
order to use that same capability to
access the same object but in so doing
the client domain can decide whether it
wants to give the same privilege for
accessing this object or lesser
privilege than what it has those are the
things that can be implemented as
policies through this front object for
example let's say that the user wants to
print a file for the user of course has
full access to the filesystem for this
particular object that is the file that
the user has created this is the
reference to the object foo and user has
full access to that but it wants to
print the file but it doesn't want to
give privilege to the printer object any
more privileged than it needs to have to
print this in particular if I want to
print a file then all I need to do is
give a one-time privilege to the printer
object in order to print that file so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take
this capability that I've got for this
file foo reduce the privilege level and
say that you've got a reference to the
same object but you have a one-time
reference now the printer object can
access the file system and present its
capability and the front object which is
associated with a file system will
verify that yes the one-time ticket that
this guy has is not expended yet and
therefore it is allowed to access this
file so that you can do its job of
printing but if it tries to present the
same handle again it will be rejected by
the front object associated with a file
system because there's a one-time
reference the capability that is being
provided by the user of the printer is a
one-time capability so we've seen how
object invocation can happen efficiently
through the door mechanism and the
thread handoff mechanism that I
mentioned was in a single node and it
can happen efficiently across the
network through the proxies and it can
also have
and securely by the fact that you can
associate policies in front of Jaques
that govern access to the object so
these are all the mechanisms that are
provided in the spring kernel and this
is where the innovation happens in other
words the external interface even though
it is a UNIX operating system under the
cover the spring system there's all of
these innovations in terms of how to
structure the operating system itself
using object technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
