about cathode ray tubes and that may or
may not be a name that means something
to you depending on how old you are
cathode ray tubes used to be the main
way we got televisions to work before we
had LED LCD and plasma televisions and
let's investigate how exactly these
tubes work so on one end of the tube we
have an electron here and we give it
some really large initial velocity V
zero such that it shoots across this
tube towards this green screen over here
and when this electron hits the screen
over here it temporary causes it to
light up producing a dot on the screen
now you can imagine if we were able to
draw lots of these dots on the screen we
could use it to draw images like this
one here but in order for us to be able
to make dots on other parts of the
screen we have to bend the path of the
electron so it doesn't just go in a
straight line and how can we bend the
path on electron well one easy way is
with an electric field and we saw in the
previous two questions that a great way
to produce a nice constant magnetic
field is to have two parallel plates
like these two so when this negatively
charged electron moves into this
electric field it'll get pulled towards
the positive plate directing it to this
part of the screen and you can imagine
if we wanted the electron to go down
here we just switch the charges so the
negative charges were up here and the
positive charges were down here so this
means we can control what part of the
screen the electron hits and therefore
lights up just by changing the strength
and direction of this electric field
here so for this problem you're gonna
tell me how strong I should make this
electric field such that this electron
gets bent a distance away from the
center from it's straight line path of
Delta Y so you should assume that the
electron is in the magnetic field for a
total distance of 0.5 meters and we want
the deviation away from the center Delta
Y to be equal to 0.1 meters will also
assume that the electron enters the
field with an initial velocity of 1
times 10 to the seventh meters per
second you will also need the charge and
mass of the electron which I have
provided here now a few quick notes
you'll notice that this speed here is
really large and the super astute among
you might notice that it's actually
getting close to being the speed of
light and if you've heard anything about
the theory of relativity you might know
that as we get close to the speed of
light strange things start to happen we
won't worry about any of that in this
problem now so just assume that
everything behaves as we're used to also
note that even though I've drawn my
field lines so the arrows are pointing
down the electron is going to bend
up because it has a negative charge and
we always draw the field lines in the
direction a positive charge will move
alright so you can put your answer for
the strength of the electric field right
here and put it in units of Newton's per
Coulomb alright good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
