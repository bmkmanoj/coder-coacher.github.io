existing Gradle project we'll be using
the wrapper because that way we can
ensure that everyone working on the
project is using the same version of
Gradle for our purposes however it'd be
a bit of a pain to generate Gradle
wrapper scripts for every single one of
these folders so we'll have you use a
local installation instead you can find
these instructions in the course
repository under 1.02
exercise install Gradle these
instructions will have your first check
that you've got a working Java
installation and then we'll walk you
through the process of installing Gradle
note that if you're on Mac and you're a
homebrew user that's a very easy way to
install Gradle also on Mac there is the
g vm the groovy environment manager and
that will also automatically install
Gradle for you those are some good
options to check out so let's walk
through the process of installing Gradle
manually first let's check that we have
a working Java installation looks like
we're good to go here if you don't have
a working Java installation there are
instructions for how to install that in
the course repository now we need to
download Gradle head on over to Gradle
org slash downloads to do so we want the
complete distribution once we have the
Gradle complete distribution downloaded
we need to do a bunch of other things to
get Gradle installed we need to move it
to an appropriate place on our machine
our suggestion is user local Gradle and
then we also need to add a few
environment variables you can do all
this by yourself however if you just
paste in this giant block of script into
your console that'll do it all
automatically all right here goes
nothing
there we go Gradle has been extracted to
use your local Gradle and now we're
ready to rock by the way if that last
command complained you might need to run
it with sudo
all right let's see if Gradle installed
correctly hey there we go that's looking
good Gradle 2.3 ready for action</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
