images for the record and stop recording
button adding images of different sizes
is easy with an Xcode and it can make
your iOS app look a whole lot better to
start click on the assets catalog this
blue icon here in the project navigator
we're going to add a new image set by
clicking on this plus button here on the
bottom of the screen and selecting new
image set let's name this record button
by single clicking on this newly created
image set now we need images for 1x 2x
and 3x we're going to explain 1x 2x and
3x in full detail in the UI kit
fundamentals lesson later in this course
for now just know that we need different
sizes for different iphones and ipads
our graphic designers have already
created those icons for us so i just
need to drag them over from the finder
folder to the corresponding xcode box
let's try to record 100 into the one
xbox the record 200 into the two xbox
and the record 300 into the three xbox
back in may not storyboard we can select
a record button in a document outline
and under image we can select our record
button image note that our button now
has both an image and the text we can
remove the record text since the image
does that work for us and the tap to
record label further explains it select
the required field here under the title
and clear it and then hit return for it
to take effect now since the button has
changed our outer layer constraints are
incorrect we can fix this issue easily
with the help of Xcode click on the
yellow disclosure button here to see our
auto layout issues we see three auto
layout issues one with the recording
label one with the stop recording button
and one with the record button remember
that everything on the screen is
positioned off the record button so we
need to fix it first select it here by
pressing the CLO disclosure triangle and
choose update frames press fix miss
placement this is just the frame on our
record button so that fits the image
for these other two issues we're going
to choose update frames as well let's
first fix the recording label update
frames and fix misplacement and do the
same for the stop recording button
update frames and fix misplacement now
they're all correct and properly
positioned off of the recording button
one last thing let's turn off the screen
background let's go back into the
document outline here select our
recording button scroll down to the
background and instead of green let's
choose the transparent one that's it our
recording button looks much better below
you're going to find the steps for
adding the icons for the stop recording
button so it can look good as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
