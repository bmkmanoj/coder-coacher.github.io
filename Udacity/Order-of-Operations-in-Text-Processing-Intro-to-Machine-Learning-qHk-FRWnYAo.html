we haven't already given you the answer
hopefully you had to think about it a
little bit the answer is that you want
to do stemming before you do the bag of
words representation and that's for two
reasons the first one is if you put it
in the bag of words representation
before you stem then there's kind of no
point in stemming because you could get
the same word repeated many times within
your bag of words representation so
you're not really like condensing the
information in any useful way in fact
you're probably making it noisier and
worse because you'll just have the word
spots in there six times also it's more
technically feasible to apply stemming
first and then put it in the bag of
words representation because stemming is
going to assume a string and the bag of
words representation is going to look
like some kind of matrix that has many
different documents and and words within
those documents so you almost always
want to do stemming is one of the first
steps in your text processing you go
through and you stem each word and then
you put it into the representation that
you'll use in your machine learning
algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
