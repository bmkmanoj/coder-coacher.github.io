question experimentally which is just to
construct a set where it's a list with
each element as the object that you're
constructing it set from and what you'll
find is that it's possible to construct
a set where 101 is an element where hash
browns the string is an element if you
try to construct a set where assets an
element that's an error and it's an
error because it's not a hashable object
we'll talk more about that next we can
construct a set where an element is at
uppal we haven't actually talked about
tuples yet in cs101 but this is
something that you've actually used when
you return to values from a procedure
that's what's going on it's like a list
but it's immutable you could figure out
experimentally that that's hashable or
you could do searches to find out why
and finally perhaps the most surprising
one is that you can construct a set
where an object in it is set set by
itself is actually a type which itself
is an immutable object so this question
involves lots of things that you might
not have learned about jet certainly
lots of things we didn't cover in cs101
but the point of the quiz is to see that
well you can do experiments and you can
do research using the documentation to
answer these questions yourself so let's
look at how you might have done that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
