set x1 to true x2 to false and x3 to
false and the way to figure this out is
at least for me it was the following so
you have to set x1 to true because
otherwise this thing here will be false
and you see we have a number of ends so
if this evaluates to 0 the whole formula
cannot be satisfied so we already know
this assignment here which gives us a 1
here and a 0 here also now since we have
a 0 here we must make sure that not x2
evaluates to true so we have to set it
to false and if we set it to false we
get a 1 here got a 1 here and a 0 here
and since this year has been set to 0
and again we need to make sure that
these or that these brackets here
evaluates to true we also have to set x3
to false so that this here becomes a 1
which gives us a 1 here as well and 0
here as well and so for the whole thing
this year evaluates to 1 this here
evaluates to 1 because this evaluates to
1 and this one here as well this goes to
1 and this one here as well and so we
have 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 which satisfies the
whole formula</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
