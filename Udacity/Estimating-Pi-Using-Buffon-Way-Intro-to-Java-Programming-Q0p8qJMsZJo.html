nextdouble will give me something
between zero and one but I want it to be
between zero and two and I definitely
want a double because why low could be
anywhere between zero and two then I'll
generate another double between 0 and
180 and I'll use both of those to
calculate why hi
which is why low plus the sine of a in
radians now if Y high is greater than or
equal to 2 then I increment the number
of hits but I want to do all of this
try as times so I'll highlight it all
hit tab to indent and then wrap it in a
for loop and I'll need to actually
declare hits which starts off at 0 all
right let's try this I'm gonna try it
thirty thousand times three point one
three I guess it's okay it's not great
let's try it again
three hundred thousand it's a little
closer to 3.14 how about three million
or 30 million 30 million this one might
take a second but not that long three
point one four one we're getting much
closer now but it took 30 million flips
and pi is actually 3.1415 something or
another so we've only got three digits
correct
I think anyone who tried to do this
without a computer would be flipping
needles for their entire life this
method was simply not viable without a
computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
