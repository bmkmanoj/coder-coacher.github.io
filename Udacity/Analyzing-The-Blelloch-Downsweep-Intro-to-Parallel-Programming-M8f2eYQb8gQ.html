know the complexity of the first phase
this reduce phase already we know that
it has log n steps as a function of the
input count in and or in operations so
actually we have if we have n elements
we're going to have n minus 1 additions
and the analysis for the down sweep
phase is exactly the same as the
analysis for the reduce phase because
the communication pattern here is
exactly the same except mirror imaged as
the communication pattern here so we
know that down sweep also has log n
steps and a linear amount of work this
is great we've now reached the same work
efficiency as the serial implementation
note however that it has more steps than
the helis and steel formulation recall
that the hillis and steele formulation
had log n steps and the block
formulation this reduced down sweep
method has two log n steps but the
advantage of this block implementation
is less work overall recall again that
the hillis and steele scan had oh of n
log n work whereas the block scan has
linear amount of work with respect to
the input now which is faster that's a
good question to some extent it's
dependent on the particular GPU the
problem size the particular
optimizations that you choose during the
implementation but to give you a little
bit of intuition as to how you might
think about the problem of choosing
between two different formulations of
the same algorithm one of which has
superior work efficiency like bollock
scan one of which has superior step
efficiency like ellison steal scan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
