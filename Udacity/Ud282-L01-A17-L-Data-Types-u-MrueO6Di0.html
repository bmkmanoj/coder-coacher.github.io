variable types we've already used some
integer variables and seen how to
declare them initialize them and update
them to keep track of numbers as they
change however the way Java stores an
integer value is pretty much like using
a relatively small box and for the same
reason that small boxes are easier to
move around integers tend to make your
programs run a lot faster than other
types
that's why Java limits the value of an
integer to this 10 digit number over
here anything larger than that won't fit
into an integer variable this would were
acquired for most programs but sometimes
we need to keep track of much larger
numbers that's why Java offers this
variable type called long long variables
can store much larger numbers than an
integer but with the cost of making your
program run slightly slower so when
writing a program you should decide if
the variable that you're going to use
would ever need to have a value larger
than this value here if so then use a
long
if not then using the integers would be
the wiser choice both integers and lungs
can also store negative values however
they cannot store fractions and that's
why Java has this third datatype called
double which can store pretty much
anything a normal positive number a
negative number fractional number
however just like the long type it comes
with a cost of slowing down your program
so it's still much wiser to use integers
or Long's when your values don't have
any fractions in them when storing text
however we can use the string variable
that we've seen earlier we can declare
it and initialize it just like any other
variable
however when initializing a string
variable to a particular text we usually
use those quotation marks around a text
another text data type is called a
character which is shortened to char it
allows you to store just a single letter
without having to store it in a string
notice that we're using single codes
here now instead of the double codes
with a string you can store any type of
character into a character variable even
single digits like the number 3 but be
careful not to confuse it with an in
three a character variable is used to
display text or concatenate it with
other strings but not for mathematical
operations like with integers or Long's
also remember that a character can only
store one letter so if we try to set
this character variable 10 into this one
zero setting here Java would complain
and won't accept it sometimes instead of
wanting to store a number in a variable
or a text we would want to store the
result of a decision that the computer
made and this is when we use the boolean
variable it can only have two values
either true or false pretty much like
the answer of a yes or no question or
like a checkbox whether it's checked or
not but we'll see a lot more about how
to use this boolean variables in the
next lesson when we talk about decision
making</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
