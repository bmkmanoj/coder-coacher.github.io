to vertex cover those cases are actually
the easy ones and I'll show you why so
either V or you already has an
assignment and we can just consider one
of those cases so let's say V already
has an assignment here's you and there's
two cases either we said yes V is in the
independent set or we say no V is not in
the independent set now this case up
here that's very easy to see because if
we is in the independent set and there's
an edge here between those vertices then
you cannot be in the independent set so
that one's very clear now what about the
case down here that's the case that
requires a little more thought by itself
right now it could either be that you is
in the independent set or it's not and
we don't know so you might have been
inclined to think that we need to modify
the search tree or initiate some other
form of brute force search but actually
that's not necessary now we'll show you
why this vertex you here there's two
possibilities so if u is not connected
to any other vertices so let's say all
other vertices in the network are
independent of you then we can put you
into the independent set without having
to think because we're looking for a
maximum size independent set this is the
only connection that you has to other
vertices wine will just take it doesn't
really cause any other conflicts now
what if you is connected to other
vertices and here there's three
different possibilities the first
possibility is that you has some
neighboring vertex so one that is
connected by an edge where we already
have assigned it to be in the
independent set and in that case we can
immediately say no you cannot be in the
independent set we must assume that none
of these vertices here is already in the
independent set so now there's two
different cases one is that one of these
vertices here has not yet received an
assignment and in that case we don't
have to worry about modifying the search
tree because now we're looking at a case
like this here again so we can use our
standard search tree to search through
assignments for these two vertices here
if every vertex here on the other hand
already has an assignment then we just
discussed because we just dealt with the
other case that all of these assignments
here must be a zero so all of these
vertices here and there can be more of
course are not part of the independent
set and that means that we
and take you into the independent set
again it might not have been obvious in
terms of thinking it through what you do
in this case but for an algorithm we can
design it in a way so that the algorithm
always knows what it is to do first of
all it looks for edges we're both
vertices do not have an assignment and
once it cannot find those edges anymore
then it will know how to deal with the
remaining vertices and this of course
means that for independent set we can
use a search tree that just like vertex
cover always finds an assignment for two
vertices or at least two vertices so its
height so to say of the search tree as
an half the size of the layers
multiplies by factor three so the size
of the overall tree is three to the
power of n half for independent set we
have a search tree of size 1.73 three to
the power of n just like vertex cover
the calculation here is the same and
because independent set and clique are
so similar we just have to transform the
network to the inverse network as you
remember hopefully from the first unit
we also have a search tree of size 1.73
three to the power of n four clique just
like Alice no reason to be super happy
but Bob and Carol can be a little
happier now and of course we're going to
go on investigating</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
