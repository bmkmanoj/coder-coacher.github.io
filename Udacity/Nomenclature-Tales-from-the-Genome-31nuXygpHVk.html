alphabet of your genetic code C T a and
G but every time we use these four
letters in our DNA they really represent
a specific chemical structure coded here
in the nitrogenous base put together in
sequence many deoxynucleotides
these individual nitrogenous bases are
part of deoxynucleotides that build up
what we call deoxyribonucleic acid now
that name can seem complicated but it's
really intended just to describe the
chemistry of the molecule you can see
the chemistry actually here I've written
out the organic chemistry structure of
this same sequence of deoxynucleotides
where you can see each position there's
an atom nitrogen oxygen phosphorus these
are elements from the periodic table
this is chemistry that makes up our
biology of who we are
the name deoxyribonucleic acid is simply
a useful term to describe this chemistry
take this individual nucleotide here
that has a nitrogenous base adenine
attached now there are four parts to the
title deoxyribonucleic acid first
there's the deoxy part next there's the
Ryba part then there's the nucleic part
and then there's the acid part each of
these four parts of deoxyribonucleic
acid describe a specific part of this
chemistry for example this part of the
molecule here called a phosphate group
can actually be acidic under certain
conditions this part of the molecule
here is called a ribose sugar I don't
know if you know this or not but sugars
are also molecules this part of the
sugar right here is actually missing an
oxygen atom and then I tried in a space
structure we've already mentioned
contains nitrogen what I want
to tell me is which number from DNA or
deoxyribonucleic acid is shown here
describes which part of the chemistry of
the deoxy nucleotide
now this could be a little tricky if you
don't have a chemistry background but
I've tried to lay it out in such a way
that makes it pretty straightforward for
you to identify so if you have trouble
just go ahead and take a guess and see
if you can get it right put a number
into each text box that you see here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
