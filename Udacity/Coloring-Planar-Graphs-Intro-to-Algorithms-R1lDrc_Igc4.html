just because it just shows how weird
computational complexity results can be
let's think about the color ability of
planar graphs in particular here's a
decision problem we're given a graph G
and a cullinan and a number K is planar
graph G K colorable and let's look at
how the question the difficulty the
question differs as we change K so if K
is 1 how is what kind of graphs are K
colorable graphs with no edges so we can
answer this question in constant time if
the number of edges is greater than 0 no
right as soon as there's a single edge
then you're going to need two colors to
color the nodes and then all right what
if what if it's 2 we want to know is
this graph 2 colorable well you know
this one already because two color
ability is exactly the same as testing
whether the graph is bipartite and in a
previous unit you showed that that could
be solved with depth-first search
and therefore runs in big data of n plus
M if K is 3 well 3 colorability we
showed was np-complete but we didn't do
that for planar graphs we did that for
general graphs but it turns out that you
can actually introduce another gadget
into the mix here that actually lets you
deal with edge crossings so if you have
a piece of the graph that looks like
this and there's a crossing in it you
can actually introduce some nodes here
so that the information from this node
travels along and gets to this node
without ever having to cross another
edge that it becomes a planar graph I
didn't explain how to do this but it
turns out to be true
so three coloring a planar graph isn't
any easier than three coloring a general
graph it's np-complete
what about coloring a graph with four
colors if it's a planar graph
well remarkably it's the problems gotten
harder and harder from constant to
linear to basically it seems like it
requires exponential time it goes back
to constant time and that's because of
the celebrated for color map theorem
that says that any map can be colored
with four colors and in this particular
case any map can be translated into a
planar graph and so we know that every
planar graph can be colored with four
colors
so the constant time algorithm for this
problem is just to always say yes you
give me a graph and tell me the display
narai say yep
it's 4 colorable and therefore anything
it's also going to be 5 6 7 colorable
because you can just use the first 4 so
that's that's kind of cool so one of the
things to point out is that the the peak
of the hardness comes at K equals 3 and
that actually shows up a lot in
np-complete problems usually if there's
2 of something that you have to choose
from the problem is pretty easy because
you can try one of them and if it
doesn't work try the other one right
away but when there's three you have to
keep considering lots of different
combinations of things and the
difficulty level really really blows up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
