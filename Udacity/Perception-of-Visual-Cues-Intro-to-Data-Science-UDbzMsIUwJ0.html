published a paper on graphical
perception and methods the study
determined how accurately people read
the visual cues that are presented here
this resulted in a ranked list of most
accurate to least accurate visual cues
so you can see that position is more
accurate
whereas hue is less accurate what does
accuracy mean here well in this case it
just means how easily are people able to
perceive the values in your data set
given the visual encoding that you've
chosen you might wonder why saturation
and hue are considered inaccurate well
this is a great example one should be a
little bit cautious when using color
hues and saturation as visual cues like
all aspects of visual perception we
don't perceive color in an absolute
manner for example these are all
different shades of gray when trying to
compare and contrast them it's difficult
to know which shades of grey correspond
to exactly which values or just how much
darker one shade of gray is than another
for this reason it's really hard for
viewers of your visualization to really
know what a different shade of gray
might mean how much bigger is one data
point than another because of this you
should be careful when using color hues
and saturation to encode information in
your visualization this ranking up here
is really an oversimplification of how
visualization works so you should really
use it as a guide rather than a
definitive rule book efficiency and
exactness are not always the goal of our
visualization sometimes color saturation
or color hue or volume or area can be
really effective to communicate what
we're trying to tell the viewer however
it's good to know generally how well
people will be able to read different
visual cues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
