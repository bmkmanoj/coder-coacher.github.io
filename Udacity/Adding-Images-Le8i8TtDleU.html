this one is the image tag it looks like
this IMG and this is for including
images it has the following structure
the opening IMG tag and has an attribute
called source SRC equals and this equals
a URL this is the URL of the image to
download remember we talked about how
the web servers can serve all sorts of
different types of content if you're
going to serve an image this is how you
would do it you would include it in an
image tag in HTML and you reference the
URL and then there's another attribute
called alt which stands for alternate
and this is text that gets displayed
when the image doesn't load it's
required in the sense that HTML parses
will complain at you if it's not there
nothing will break but it's really nice
to include it so are broken requests
like if if our browser requests the URL
it doesn't exist this is the text that
gets displayed and it's also for blind
people you know it doesn't take much to
add an alt text and it'll make
somebody's life or somebody's day at
least mildly easier and one other thing
I'd like to point out here is every tag
we've talked about so far has had a
closing tag images don't this is the
entire tag there's no contents to an
image see it just ends right here this
is called a void tag and a void tag is a
tag that has no content and because it
has no content it doesn't need a closing
tag let's try this thing out in the
browser and see how it looks in real
life okay so here we are in our little
HTML previewer let's let's add an image
ok so we've got our our image tag source
equals Udacity calm and Hipmunk that PNG
this is our URL of an image that I've
prepared for us we've got some alt text
there let's go ahead and click update
and tada there's our image now a couple
other things we can do
I could put some text here there's our
text images just appear in line with
text yeah so a small image just appears
right in the middle of other text</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
