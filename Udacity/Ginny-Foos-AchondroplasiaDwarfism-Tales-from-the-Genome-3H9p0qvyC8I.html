community you know uh thirty minutes
away from MIT Harvard you know all of
the Ivy League's
in Boston and I think that's that speaks
a lot to kids and their value in that
value system but their manners and so
forth so I don't remember getting teased
too much I'm sure I did and how much of
that I have sort of put under the
surface and forgotten about but I don't
I have a tougher time even today when
I'm in an inner-city environment where
my the people surrounding me don't have
the same etiquette and don't have the
same education the same exposure and
that's really where I struggle more than
where I grew up in a suburb of Boston
well to get a bit more of that sort of
educated thought and idea um I want you
to tell us um you know as a medical
condition of dwarfism what is what do
you know is the cause of shorter stature
and in particular in your case what is
the what is the cause of this well
remember there are over 200 different
types of dwarfism achondroplasia being
the most common so if you were to meet
another little person in your life most
likely they'll have a achondroplasia so
I can only really speak to a condor
pleasure it is a dominant gene it is
also a mutation so what that means is an
individual can have a condor pleasure
for two reasons one would be their
parents of it and it's been inherited as
it was with my children the other would
be it's a genetic mutation which is a
complete unexplained event which is what
it was for me sure yeah are you familiar
with the gene that is actually mutated
in most cases of achondroplasia
the FRS the fgfr3 gene that's what I am
okay
there's a reason I don't teach science
and I'm an English and drama teacher and
Spanish teacher not a science teacher so
yes very familiar I don't spend a whole
lot of time conversing about it what is
really really cool is that when the gene
was discovered
in 1994 in 1992 the National Convention
was in San Francisco I was eight months
pregnant we had both my in-laws there as
well as my parents and when we have a
National Convention that little people
of America puts on a gaggle of health
care providers fly in that have
specialized or have an interest in
dwarfism and so there'll be no less than
15 or 20 geneticists from around the
country sometimes we even have
international geneticists and we all
volunteered ourselves for a blood draw
when I was 8 months pregnant and they
sent me home with a vial for umbilical
book blood that I was when I was going
to give birth a month later so that they
could get and built umbilical cord blood
so I like to say we had a little bit of
something to do with the discovery of
the gene two years later there any
advantages to having a slightly shorter
stature in general this is a very common
question and I always say to myself I've
got to write it down because I've never
you know and fully prepare it but in
this instance I did think about it some
let's start with the disadvantages
because that's a shorter list at the
grocery store it's horrible and I
haven't quite figured out the best time
to go if I were not little the best time
to go clearly would be 6:30 or 7:00 in
the morning when I'm awake because it's
not crowded but it's a very bad time for
me to go when it's not crowded because
there aren't people in the aisles to
turn to and say can you hand me that jar
up there so I think the compromise is
more like 10:00 a.m. you know which it
fortunately because I don't work full
time I can do that and I can always
pretty much count on waiting no more
than 2 or 3 minutes for somebody to show
up in the aisle I'm not gonna go to
customer service every time I need help
you get very savvy at flirting with
people to get what you need so I will
strike up a conversation instantly with
the main motivation being that I need
that can of tomatoes at the top of the
counter
other disadvantages it really depends
it's hard to go into communities that
are less educated and less mannered
because we are so comfortable in in our
community which acquainted has gotten to
know us on so many different levels over
the last 20 years
my husband died both our careers myself
as a substitute teacher and he as a an
IT guy for small businesses in our
immediate area we're very well known
only because people don't forget us you
know it's not a comment on our
personality however I've been told that
we sort of have Mary ma'am and his
personalities as well so we get really
comfortable in our environment and then
when we step out to a different
environment and the reaction is totally
inappropriate it's it's it's a slap in
the face it's a reminder can you I mean
if you're comfortable can you give us an
example of a negative reaction that you
actually can have I can give you two and
and and they're a little bit different
one of them was pure ignorance there's
nothing more upsetting to me than to be
in an environment where it's the adults
that are grabbing the children and
saying look at the midget come here come
here Frankie come look at the midget I
cannot believe that in this day of age
that's still happening but when I go
into inner-city environments and a
grocery store you know grocery stores
are really harsh places for me to be not
only because of the physical thing but
you're trapped you know you're in a
grocery store line and you can't go
anywhere and you've got kids with their
fingers right five feet away from you
and you're trapped so that is definitely
you know hard the other example of
ignorance was an educated ignorant if I
dare say the five of us were on our
bikes in San Francisco by the Palace of
Fine Arts we've been riding our bikes
around and
rode in front of a tour bus from with
tourists from another country we can
pretty much assure you that when we go
by a tour bus or a group of tourists
from other countries those video cameras
are trained on us like snipers and my
husband has gotten to the point he's a
very very patient man
but he will walk right up to the camera
and say you will delete that picture he
gets very upset and imagine having 50 of
them on your family you feel like there
are snipers on you let's go back to some
of these some of some of the advantages
oh yeah that's a longer list it really
is advantages let's see well here's a
hybrid why don't we do the hybrid first
the spotlight is always on so you can be
entertaining and the life of the party
and everyone wants to talk to you you
could get a special spot on tales from
the genome people remember me that's
kind of the spotlight too but if I want
to jog somebody's memory over the phone
and I'll say hey this is Ginny Foos your
little customer oh yes how are you so I
get the information quicker yeah when I
get tickets to a show the tickets I can
say I need the tickets and I get good
tickets so that's an advantage we went
camping recently and I was able to stand
up in my tent and change my clothes
whereas the advertised friends could not
oh yes airplane travel is I would argue
more comfortable for me but the
difference is is that my feet are
dangling look at right now and yours or
not so mine are going to maybe go to
sleep but when I've gone on a long
flight if there happens to
be an empty seat next to mine I can
actually lay down
flight attendants don't like it much but
I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
