these it is a pain to change we've
basically hard-coded these % asses here
and there and we're doing this
complicated logic to put everything
together that is 0 fun we don't get any
syntax highlighting that's correct
because we're putting HTML in our Python
code so we're not dealing with HTML are
basically dealing with big strings and
that's really tedious to manipulate and
your editor is set up to write Python
our code is ugly I didn't have a whole
lot of fun explaining that code to you I
can't imagine you had a whole lot of fun
listening to me attempt to do so we can
certainly make things a lot more clear
and it's error-prone you know if you
miss one of those % s is you get a
percent s in your output if you want to
you know add extra things it's very
difficult to reason about and kind of
figure out what goes where so this is
obviously not a particularly great
approach for generating HTML from our
web application you know it works for
short little things like just a simple
simple tiny form but anything more
complicated in that is very unwieldly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
