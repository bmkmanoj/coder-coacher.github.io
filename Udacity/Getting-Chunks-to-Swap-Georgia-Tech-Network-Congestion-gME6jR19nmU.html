needs to solve is ensuring that each
client gets chunks to swap with other
clients if all of the clients received
the same chunks then no one would want
to trade with one another and everyone
would have an incomplete copy of the
file to solve this problem BitTorrent
clients use a policy called rarest piece
first recipes first allows a client to
determine which pieces are the most rare
among clients and download the rarest
pieces of the file first this ensures
that the most common pieces are left to
the end to download and that a large
variety of pieces are downloaded from
the cedar additionally a client has
nothing to trade and it's important to
get a complete piece as soon as possible
rare pieces are typically available at
fewer piers initially so downloading a
rare piece is initially maybe not a good
idea so one policy that clients use is
to select a random piece of the file and
download it from the cedar in the
endgame the client actively requests any
missing pieces from all Peters and
redundant requests are cancelled when
the missing piece arrives this ensures
that a single pier with the slow
transfer rate doesn't prevent the
download from completing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
