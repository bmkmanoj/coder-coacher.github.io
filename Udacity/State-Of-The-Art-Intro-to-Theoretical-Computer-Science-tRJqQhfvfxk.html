lot about solving and P complete
problems in practice you have learned
about search tree optimization you have
learned about pre-processing and you
have also learned about other techniques
such as fixed parameter tractability and
this is huge now of course in this unit
I could only teach you the very basic
techniques that are used so you might be
wondering what is the state of the art
for solving and P complete problems in
practice and I would like you to give
you a few examples and numbers so for
vertex cover on practically relevant
inputs you can sometimes find the vertex
cover for graphs with over 10,000
vertices for independent set and clique
independent sets and clicks have been
calculated for many graphs with our 1000
vertices and traveling salesman which is
very close to shortest tour and actually
sometimes people also solve shortest
tour so traveling salesman you really
have to be specific what kind of problem
you're talking about but there's one
example where somebody solved an
instance with over 85,000 vertices so
think about what this means for the for
computer scientists that we met
throughout this course so far Alice
started out with not being able to solve
vertex cover for a graph with 10 or 20
vertices and then she learned about NP
completeness so her situation was
actually quite dire but then we showed
her that there's search tree
optimization and preprocessing and if
those techniques are applied in the
right way then Alice can certainly
expect to be able to solve her problem
if she's working with 500 or 1000
vertices because the thing is this the
instances for vertex cover that come up
in practice are actually much easier to
solve than worst-case instances one
example is this year practical instances
with up to 10,000 vertices I think Alice
can be pretty happy what about Bob and
Carol Bob and Carol of course they
started out being as unhappy as Alice
because they also had impractical
algorithms and then they found out about
NP completeness of course they can also
use search trees and preprocessing but
their problems turn out to be harder to
solve than vertex cover in general even
so I think they should be a little bit
happy because for the problems that they
try to solve in genetics and in finance
I think being able to work with about a
thousand vertices should be ok and again
there we
to assume that of course they are
working with inputs that are more easily
solvable in worst case inputs but
usually in practice again that's the
case so what about Dave who we met very
late in this course well when we met
Dave we showed a very complex proof that
his problem was np-complete so he
started out very unhappy as well I would
assume and actually I think he stayed
unhappy throughout this unit because
whenever we came across shortest tour or
traveling salesman we always had to say
well we're not really quite sure on how
to do this this is an open research
problem but then again since this
problem is so highly relevant at
practice there have been lots of
developments regarding sophisticated
algorithms that work very well in
practice so we can basically put it like
this from a theoretical perspective dave
has to be very very unhappy but if you
use the sophisticated algorithms then
actually Dave can be the happiest of all
because the algorithms that have been
developed for traveling salesman work
extremely well in practice and finally
of course we should also say a little
bit about sat for the satisfiability
problem there are annual competitions
and these competitions of course are
based on mostly on instances that are
current practice but an instances that
are deliberately hard and yet still each
year usually instances are solved with
over a thousand variables now set is a
problem that behaves very differently so
there are some instances of sad even
with 10,000 or 100,000 variables that
are very very easy to solve because
pre-processing is very effective for
these instances and then there are other
instances for sat that just have a few
hundred variables that are super super
hard to solve so there you usually need
to try a lot of different packages and
techniques but nevertheless when you
come across a an instance of SAT and
there are certain practical situations
where that is the case then so you
shouldn't despair SAT again if you're
working with real word instances for sad
it's usually worth a try to solve it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
