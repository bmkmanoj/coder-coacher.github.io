learning and if you're in this class
you're already familiar with
project-based learning because this
entire class is project-based learning
we've built it on that foundation
project-based learning is a pedagogical
technique where students learn through
big long-term projects sometimes someone
open-ended as opposed to through small
written assignments or quizzes or tests
there are a lot of real benefits to
project-based learning and one of my
favorites is the idea of authenticity
typically when we go into the actual
fields that we're teaching about what
were our work is is actually pretty
project-based we do big long-term
projects rather than small tasks each
day and so by teaching students using
project-based learning we're not only
teaching them the content we want them
to know but we're also teaching them
what it's like to actually be a part of
that field and similarly personalization
is a really big benefit of this as well
typically when students do a project
they actually feel some personal
connection to what they produced in some
of the projects we've done our other OMS
classes we've seen students really
develop their projects and pursue them
after the semester is over some of them
have gone so far as to name their
projects or give them personalities so
it's really a personal connection
between the student in the project that
they develop the longer term and more
open-ended nature of the project also
means that we can do some things to
facilitate real learning and the more
important learning strategies that we
want students to develop things like
planning what they're going to do
monitoring how it's going and adjusting
it accordingly if it's not going very
well oftentimes in traditional education
by the time of student recognizes that
what they're doing isn't working it
might be too late to fix it if it's a
test or quiz or something but with
projects the longer term nature then
gives students time to recognize what
I've been working on is it really
working how can I evaluate it how can i
recover so there are a lot of benefits
of project-based learning the difficulty
is that they aren't always easy to
implement in a regular classroom
projects are bigger and they're open
ended and they're very personal to
students and that makes it very
difficult to give students feedback on
them it makes it difficult to grade
projects how do you grade to students
that did very very different projects if
it's a very open-ended project print
it's a lot of difficulty but that's
where technology can really play a role
technology gives us an environment in
which we can allow students to pursue
some open-ended projects and have
built-in functionalities to develop
their ideas and construct whatever they
want to
struct and through some artificial
intelligence we can actually start to
build in some of that feedback directly
into the environment we can give them
feedback right in the context of what
they're doing without requiring a
teacher to be consistently monitoring
what they're doing so technology can
really bring project-based learning to
life and so we'll talk about the
different ways in which project-based
learning can be done and how technology
can help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
