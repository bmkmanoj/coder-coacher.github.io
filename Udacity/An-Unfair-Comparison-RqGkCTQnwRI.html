about the tracking that I just showed
you let's not worry too much about the
mean shifting part of it and just this
idea of using the color distribution as
a the matching of the color distribution
the similarity as a sensor model okay
because when we do this mean shift and
we're tracking the single peak we're a
little bit back to like our kalman
universe right where the idea was
there's a single hypothesis we could
just use this similarity function the
matching function of the color
distributions as the sensor model for
particle filtering that is your
particles spread out and they want to
say well what's the probability of
getting this sensor of measurement if
that's actually the my state well you
can simply say well it's just a measure
of how close the color distribution is
using that biochar distance or some
other way of comparing of distributions
and in fact people have done this and
now I have to show you a totally unfair
slide and the reason it's unfair is this
slide I found I was looking at this is
in a presentation given online talking
about mean shift I don't actually know
the source of this picture so I can't
give you the the reference to go look it
up etc and then they show this
interesting thing where the mean shift
is tracking this cute little kid and
then falls apart okay now why would it
fall apart this is a little bit sneaky
you'll notice this brown envelope the
cardboard box in the background it has
some color distributions similar to the
face of the kid so if you've ever
thought little kids are really pretty
much cardboard boxes you're right or at
least that's what means shift says and
then what they showed is that if you
used a particle tracker particle filter
tracker it falls off a little bit see it
fell off but then it catches back on
that's what particle filters do right
they entertain multiple hypotheses so
even if some weird hypothesis is looking
good as long as the real one eventually
becomes better it'll come back to it and
that's what it's showing here but
basically the idea is you can use
the similarity function of the two color
distributions as your sensor model for a
particle filter and this relates to this
idea of what I said before that particle
filters really are pretty flexible you
can pull out whatever sensor model you
want to use as long as you can put it
within this Bayesian framework of P of Z
