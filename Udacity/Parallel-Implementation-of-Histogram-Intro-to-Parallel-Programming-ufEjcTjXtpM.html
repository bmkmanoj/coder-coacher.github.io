different formulations of a workable
parallel histogram implementation now
you might be looking at this serial code
and thinking yeah why can't we just
unroll the serial loop end times and
launch a thread for each iteration of
the loop note if there's n measurements
taken we could consider launching M
threads each of which increments one pin
count it turns out this doesn't work and
it's important to understand why so Dave
already covered this topic in the last
unit so you can feel free to zip through
this part if you totally understand it
already anyway we're going to take a
look at this particular kernel this
naive histo kernel in this kernel each
thread will be responsible for
classifying one element and incrementing
the histogram bin corresponding to that
element so let's look at this very
simple kernel in this code the first
thing we're going to do is compute our
global ID then we're going to fetch our
item from global memory then we're going
to calculate which been our item is
associated with and in this case we're
just using a very simple mod operator to
do it and finally we're going to
increment the bin with which our item is
associated so if we scroll down to the
main routine here we see that we have
65,000 elements that we're going to
classify into 16 bins so we would expect
4096 items per bin so what happens when
we run this so I'm going to run this
kernel on a workstation that I'm
connected to in our lab so let's run
this histo executable and what we're
gonna see are the bin counts that we see
for each bed we expected 4096 items per
bin and we're not getting anywhere close
to 4096 items per men in fact we'll run
it again and if you note these Ben
counts are even changing from iteration
to iteration so what's going on here
let's go back and look at the most
important instruction in the kernel the
one where we increment the value in the
bin so let's look at what's actually
going on here what does each thread
program actually do if we implement the
simple serial algorithm in parallel it
does three separate operations the first
one is doing a global memory read to
fetch the bin value into a register the
second thing is it increments the bin
value within the register and the third
thing is storing the incremented value
back to global memory
let's illustrate how this could go wrong
consider two threads running in parallel
one the black thread to the red thread
both want to increment the same bin this
blue bin here it starts off with the
value 5 both threads happen to be
running at the same time so the first
reads the value of the bin into its
local register then the second reads the
value of the bin into its local register
both increment the value in their own
local registers then the first writes
its value back to global memory storing
a 6 and the second does the same also a
6 and now we've got a problem since we'd
really like the answer 7 the fundamental
issue here is called a race condition
the problem is that incrementing the
value in global memory takes multiple
steps and it's possible as we've seen
here for two processors running
simultaneously to enter leave these
steps note that this is not going to
happen in the serial code because in the
serial code each iteration of the loop
runs separately and there's no danger of
one threads code running at the same
time as another threads code so the
simple solution doesn't work so now
let's look at three different ways that
we might implement this in parallel that
will work all three of these methods are
good parallel methods none are obviously
better or worse and we'll talk about
their pros and cons as we describe them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
