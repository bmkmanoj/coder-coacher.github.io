project builds successfully but how do
we know that it works right the best
answer that software engineering has
come up with for this is to use a lot of
different kinds of tests now
testing is a huge subject and we
actually have a whole course on it but
let's take a quick look at some
different kinds of tests unit tests are
tests the developers write alongside the
application code each test checks the
behavior of one specific unit of code
like a function or class they're
designed to be automated developers will
run them repeatedly as part of the
development process regression tests on
the other hand get written as part of
debugging and troubleshooting
once you've fixed a bug you want to make
sure that it doesn't come back - to some
future oversight a regression so you add
a test the checks specifically for that
particular bug like unit tests
regression tests are automated and run
frequently a smoke test is something
that gets run after the build kind of a
sanity check to make sure the system
basically works before doing any more
refined testing for instance if our
project is a web server we might just
bring a server instance up and fetch the
home page just to make sure it doesn't
crash the term smoke test comes from
Electrical Engineering you can imagine
plugging an appliance or a machine in
and seeing if it catches fire but it
also has an older meaning in plumbing as
a test for newly installed pipes before
putting water in a pipe plumbers would
fill it with pressurized smoke to see if
the smoke leaked out anywhere a system
integration test is just a little bigger
it's a test of the system including not
just our code but also the backends and
dependencies and data that our code
makes use of you might often run it on
dedicated test machines but when we
treat infrastructure as code we can spin
up test instances as VMs dynamically
when we need to and doing that will test
our deployment scripts to an automated
acceptance test is something that you'd
write to verify that a system or feature
does what the user wants it to now it
can't replace everything that a human QA
tester might do but there are testing
frameworks that let you automate quite a
lot whole workflows clicking buttons
filling out data fields whatever a user
might do in your app and then depending
on your service you might have a manual
QA step as well before a launch goes to
production if that's the last step
before launch the
QA testers approval can actually tell
the continuous deployment system that
it's okay to go ahead with the rollout
so there we have six different kinds of
testing unit testing regression testing
smoke testing system integration testing
an automated and manual acceptance
testing but while we're talking about
testing let's talk about bugs too having
a single unified bug tracking system can
go a long way toward improving
communication amongst teams if it's
accessible to everyone in the
organization to report issues and
collaborate on fixing them then that's
one less barrier to getting real work
