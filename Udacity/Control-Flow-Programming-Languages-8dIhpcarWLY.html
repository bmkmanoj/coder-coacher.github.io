two plus three or X plus one but if you
think about most of the Python programs
you've written they've got quite a bit
more going on things like if statements
or assignment statements that influence
the state or change which parts of the
program are executed formally we say
that statements or program parts like if
or while or return change the flow of
control and that potential reasonable
analogy for control flow is a river here
I've written a relatively simple bit of
Python code but we could sort of trace
through it noting which lines get
visited we're definitely going to visit
x equals one we'll take a look at this
if because x is one it's less than five
so we're gonna curve in here and
evaluate this print but then we're gonna
kind of skip over this all else branch
and rejoin things here so you've got
this flow that sometimes branches seems
to fork or rejoins at the end control
flow which part of the program do we
execute if I'm to keep my finger on the
line that we're currently worried about
how does my finger move around we're
going to need to handle this sort of
thing if we're building an interpreter
for javascript in HTML so things like if
while and return change the flow of
control
these things are called statements to
distinguish them from expressions
expressions are typically a bit simpler
they're more like noun phrases in a
natural language a statement is more
like an entire sentence it's going to
contain a verb as well or some
instruction like change the value of ax
or jump over here statements often
contain expressions but not the other
way around you can think of this as
being a bit of a hierarchy this whole
thing is a statement the usual
abbreviation for statement is s TM T but
just this little part down here is an
expression just like a whole sentence
may contain one or two nouns so let's
say we have an environment that map's
the variable X to the value two and now
I've written a JavaScript program below
it that contains an if-then-else
statement should remind you a lot of
Python if X is less than five the
variable Y is going to be assigned to
Don otherwise the variable Y is going to
be assigned Quixote in our environment
where X is too
X is less than 5 will be evaluated to
true so the flow of control will visit
here and here but we'll skip these two
and rejoin us down here at the bottom
and hopefully at the end of the day
we'll have a new environment where X
maps to 2 and the variable Y maps to Don
Don Quixote is a classic novel written
by Miguel de Cervantes around 1605 we
get a number of expressions from it like
tilting at windmills in English the
protagonist believes a windmill to be a
mortal foe perhaps a dragon and he
charges up but gets knocked down by the
whirling arms each time these days
tilting at windmills means trying
something over and over again even
though you know you're never going to
succeed an impossible task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
