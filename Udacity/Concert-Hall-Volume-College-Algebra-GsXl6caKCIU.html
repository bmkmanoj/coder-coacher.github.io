with her understanding of acoustics to
help out with concert hall design as
before she's still pretty concerned with
how well audience members will be able
to hear the music from different places
in the concert hall now however she's
worried about reverberation time this is
basically how long a sound echoes for
after it's been produced Athena has
figured out a simplified equation for
reverberation time in the hall the
equation is T equals zero point three to
two V over a here T stands for
reverberation time V is the volume of
the hall and a is the surface area of
the hall so to figure out the
reverberation time then Athena is going
to need to find the volume and the
surface area of the room on this diagram
of the hall I've written in the
dimensions of each of the sides it's not
super important right now what X stands
for but just so you know it's the depth
of the stage back here this is how long
x is considering each of these lengths
what is the volume of our concert hall</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
