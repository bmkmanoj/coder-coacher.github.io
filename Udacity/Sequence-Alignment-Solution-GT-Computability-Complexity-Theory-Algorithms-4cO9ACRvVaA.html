out the table was rather mechanical so I
won't walk through that step we end up
with the cost of three point five so
that must have come from this neighbor
here which also has a value of three
point five diagonal steps like this
correspond to matching the two letters
so we write down that alignment here
next we have three point five which
could have come from either of these two
neighbors here let's choose this one for
now that corresponds to leaving W
unmatched so we'll write that down in
our alignment next we have a cost of two
point five which must have come from
this northwest neighbor here who has a
cost one and that corresponds to
matching these two characters together
oh and in then we have a cost one which
must have come from this northwest
neighbor so these ends get matched again
we have a cost of one and since you
doesn't match s this must have come from
the west neighbor meaning that U is left
unmatched and we can write that down
like so and lastly the esses must be
matched together often there will be
more than one path through the grid in
this example there was some ambiguity at
this step here instead of skipping W I
could have matched it with n and then we
could have left the O unmatched and that
would have left us with this alignment
here which has the same minimum cost</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
