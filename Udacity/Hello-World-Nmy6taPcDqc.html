have a phone what you can do well
Android studio has actually provided a
way for you to simulate a phone on your
computer this simulated phone has a
fancy name called the Android emulator
to start the Android emulator go ahead
and go up to the Run button and press
run you'll see a small loading circle
down here now whereas before I told you
to select the choose a reading device
radio button you're going to want to
choose the launch emulator radio button
and here is a drop-down of all the
different types of phones you can
simulate right now you should only have
one and it's most likely going to be a
Nexus 5 which is the type of phone and
API 21 refers to the operating system
level and x86 refers to a particular
type of hardware configuration anyways
this is the name for your simulated
phone and I'm going to go ahead and
click OK to start the phone now after
about 10 seconds you should see a black
phone appear on the screen you'll also
see this window here appear which will
show any sort of error messages or
activity messages from the phone okay so
here's my black phone and I'm waiting
for it to load and after a moment of
that I'm going to see this Android
loading icon and after a little bit more
time you should see this welcome screen
appear on the phone to go ahead and
start the phone swipe up from the bottom
now it's trying to simulate an actual
phone and the first time you load up an
actual phone you get all these help
icons and dialogues I'm going to just
click OK now if all goes well your app
should appear on your phone it did it
for me so I'm going to go ahead and try
to run it again ok since the emulator is
already running I can see it now under
my choose running device so I'll go
ahead and click it and I'll press the ok
button alright and it loaded up my code
on my emulated phone now I should note
that sometimes these simulated phones
don't always work correctly the first
time for example you might have this
issue that I had the first time when I
ran my simulated phone where would just
show the black screen or would just show
the Android loading symbol and it
wouldn't go beyond that these are
actually fairly common errors when
trying to start a simulated phone and
one of the reasons that we suggest using
a real device that said for the most
part they're solvable problems so if you
are running into those issues
go ahead and look at the instructor
notes for how to deal with these
situations we've provided a link to a
troubleshooting document finally since I
have your attention if you're having
difficulty with your simulated phone
sometimes you have clues in this error
output over here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
