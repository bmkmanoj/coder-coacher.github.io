self-driving car coat and earlier is
that we always declare boolean variables
like is like green at the very top of
our code before an outside of our if
statement block of code and this is
because of something called variable
scope variable scope is the block or
range of code where a certain variable
can be used and referred to in this case
we needed to use our variable is light
green in our if test condition and so
the scope of is light green has to
contain this whole if statement and by
declaring is like green outside of any
curly braces or conditions we make it
available to our whole program so our
whole program is at scope and remember
that we also have to declare variables
before we can use them in our code and
that's why our test condition variable
is always declared before we use it in
our decision-making code but what if we
instead declare a variable inside our if
statement inside its curly braces like
this variable double car speed that
keeps track of our cars speed let's set
it equal to 100 and this is gonna be in
km/h so that's about 60 miles per hour
then the scope of our car speed variable
will only be the code inside these curly
braces in fact a set of curly braces
defines a particular variable scope so
inside the scope we can use the variable
car speed and we are by printing it out
but if we try to refer to that variable
outside of these curly braces we can't
like if after the last curly brace of
our if statement we try to reduce our
car speed by 10 this will actually cause
your computer to generate an error
message and that looks something like
this cannot resolve symbol car speed and
we'll learn more about errors later but
just know that this will cause an error
because our program can't access the
variable car speed outside of its scope
you can think of variable scope as if it
were a wall or boundary whose sides are
defined by these curly braces all the
variables declared inside these walls
like car speed in this boundary can be
accessed inside the scope bounce but
once you leave the wall boundary and go
outside the curly braces even just a
little these variables can no longer be
accessed
so our car speed variable which is
declared inside the if statements curly
braces has a small scope
a small bounding wall that doesn't reach
outside the if block of code but is like
green which we declared outside of any
curly braces has a big scope a larger
wall that contains our whole program and
this lets us use and refer to our is
light green variable in our test
condition so keep this in mind as you
write your if statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
