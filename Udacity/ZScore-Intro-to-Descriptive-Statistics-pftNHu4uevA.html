how far values are from the mean we're
also concerned with whether or not
they're below the mean or above the mean
when we standardize any score on the
x-axis we get to z-score and we already
called it Z before and we're always
going to subtract the mean from the x
value and then divide by the standard
deviation so that way if we have a value
less than the mean we're going to get a
negative z-score the z-score is
basically the number of standard
deviations any value is away from the
mean therefore we can convert any value
in a normal distribution to a z-score
when we do this we standardize the
distribution we can start with any
normal distribution and then standardize
it so let's again refer back to our
normal distribution the mean is 190 this
is the actual mean of facebook friends I
looked it up but let's pretend that the
standard deviation is 36 like it was in
our example where Andy and I were
arguing our unpopularity so using this
information click the link that we share
and tell us how many Facebook friends
you have and then calculate your z-score
later we're going to analyze that data
and see if we get a normal distribution
so we'll be able to tell if some z-score
values don't match up do your best when
you calculate your z-score because it's
good practice and we're gonna use these
scores to the rest of the class if you
don't have facebook just enter 0 but be
careful this does not mean that your
z-score is going to be 0 you'll have to
calculate that and figure out what it is
and I will know if you didn't calculate
it correctly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
