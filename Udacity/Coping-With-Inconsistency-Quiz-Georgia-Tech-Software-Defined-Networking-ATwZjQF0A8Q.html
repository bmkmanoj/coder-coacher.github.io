measuring the network to figure out the
current traffic loads forming a model of
how configuration affects the underlying
paths in the network and then ultimately
reconfiguring the network to exert
control over how the traffic flows
through the network an operator might
measure the topology and traffic feed
the topology and traffic to a what-if
model that predicts what will happen
under various types of configuration
changes decide which changes to effect
on the network and then ultimately
control the network behavior by
readjusting link weights so in summary
we have measurement modeling and control
each of these three components requires
a significant amount of heavy lifting to
make both practical and accurate in
practice intradomain traffic engineering
attempts to solve an optimization
problem where the input is a graph G
where R is the set of routers and L is
the set of unidirectional links each
link L also has a fixed capacity another
input is the traffic matrix or the
offered traffic load where m IJ
represents the traffic load from router
I to router J the output of the
optimization problem is a set of link
weights where WL is the weight on any
uni-directional link L in the network
topology ultimately the setting of these
link weights should result in a fraction
of the traffic from I to J traversing
each link L such that those fractions
satisfy the network wide objective
function defining an objective function
is tricky we could talk about for
example minimizing the maximum congested
link in the network evenly splitting
traffic loads across links and so forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
