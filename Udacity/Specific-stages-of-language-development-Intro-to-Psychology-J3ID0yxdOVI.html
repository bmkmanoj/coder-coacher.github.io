language development the first stage is
cooing cooing are the first sounds that
human babies make other than crying and
this happens within the first six months
of an infant's life cooing is almost
exclusively vowels so things like ah ooh
or Eve for example it's interesting to
note that cooing is universal for all
babies meaning babies all across the
world COO in almost the exact same way
this includes babies who can hear as
well as babies who are deaf the next
stage is babbling babbling occurs after
about five or six months of an infant's
life this is when infants start to
experiment with different sounds called
phonemes phonemes consists of both
vowels and consonants an interesting
thing to note here is that through
repeated exposure to their native
language infants start to prune out
sounds that aren't native to their
language they actually lose the ability
to say and perceive non-native language
sounds that's why can be so difficult to
learn a new language and after babbling
is one word utterances this is when
babies say things like Dada or mama or
the famous no next would be the two word
utterances this happens at around 18
months but I want to send you to Greg
who has a good example of this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
