interpretation of principal components
and eventually this will just get us to
our formulas here we have our point P
and let's suppose we have some origin if
we want to minimize the square of the
distance from the point to a line we
want to find the line to minimize that
square well you remember Pythagorean
theorem of course you do right it's that
the sum of the squares of the two legs
of a right triangle are equal to the
square of the hypotenuse if we want to
minimize the squared distance of the
point to that line weakens the same
thing as maximizing the projection of
that point on the line that's what this
value is here right X transpose P X is
some unit vector through the origin and
if we project p on to it that's going to
be the vector and you want to maximize
that length so minimizing the sum of the
squares of the distance to the line is
the same thing as maximizing the sum of
the squares of the projections on that
line a way of writing that is we want to
sum up all the squares and this is just
a little bit of a matrix manipulation
trick right if I wrote my points down
here right of x1 y1 or an x2 y2 and if
this was my lines well maybe it's a be
right if I multiply X transpose B
transpose so now this is be XY XY bx all
right if you multiply that all through
what you'll realize is it's exactly that
value okay it's the sum over all the
points of that square of the magnitude
all right so what that means is
algebraically this maximizing the
projected distance can be written like
this right so our goal is to maximize X
transpose B transpose B X but we've got
a constraint right X is a unit vector so
that means that x transpose x has to
equal one so what we have to do is we
have to maximize this subject to a
constraint all right so that's what this
says here and rotors and maximize equal
to X transpose M X where m is B
transpose B so we just have a single
matrix now
I'm not going to tell you a lot about
this method but i am going to reduce
this quick notion of what's called
Lagrange multipliers here is e and
here's a prime and you notice that what
we added to e prime is this term lambda
x 1 minus x transpose x so Megan if
everything is solved correctly 1 minus X
transpose X should be what 0 whoa yes 0
so when this thing is solved correctly
it doesn't matter what this lambda is
right because it will add zero to the
term that in a very hand-wavy way that
is the method of LaGrange multipliers it
says I'm going to put in a term x lambda
that will be 0 at the correct solution
and then you solve everything and you've
satisfied your the garage multiplier
method it turns out in our case it's
even easier so that's our prime so what
we do now is we take the derivative of
that new error function e prime with
respect to X and we get this to MX plus
2 lambda X is the derivative and now in
order to minimize this we set this equal
to what Megan 00 very good we actually
rehearse that one this time and so when
you do that you get this very simple
equation that says m x equals lambda x
alright if we get the positive or
negative doesn't matter excellent it can
go in either direction all right so
that's a very special X right so when I
multiply X by a matrix M if I get back a
linear multiplier in this case lambda of
X that means X is an eigenvector of the
matrix M so that means that X is going
to be an eigenvector of this B transpose
B alright so this acts as at least
inertia this solution where we minimize
the distance to the axes the sum of the
squared distances which is the same as
maximizing the distance along says it
has something to do with this matrix B
transpose B where B was that list of all
those points</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
