the Python interpreter to get a sense of
how long things take and I've written a
procedure here that times the execution
of a piece of code right we could just
do the timing with a stopwatch and then
we have to run really long things to be
able to get a reasonably accurate time
but python has a built-in procedure we
can use to measure time and that's the
time clock procedure so we could try
just using a stopwatch and if we ran
programs that took long enough to run
this would give us a reasonable idea of
how long they took it's going to be a
lot more accurate to use this built-in
procedure which is provided by the time
library that evaluates to the number of
seconds so the value of time clock will
give us the current processor time in
seconds the starting point is fairly
arbitrary there but the important thing
is if we call it twice and we start the
time here and we stop the time at the
second call we store those in the
variable start and stop that's going to
give us the amount of time it took to
execute this code so I've written a
procedure that starts by initializing
the variable start to the current clock
time then run some code and i'll talk
more about what it's doing there in a
second and then it computes the time
between the current time and the start
time and gives us the run time and it
returns both the result of the code and
the time it took to run what's happening
here is actually quite exciting so we're
using a vowel a vowel allows us to
evaluate any string as though it were a
Python expression so we're passing in a
string here but when we pass that
stringent eval it's running it as code
so we can pass in any Python expression
we're going to start and end the timer
and in between we're going to evaluate
the code and get the result of the value
in that code so define this procedure
time execution that will give this the
time it takes to evaluate any Python
expression and now we're going to run
some tests and instead of running them
through the web browser ID like you've
been using so far I'm going to run them
directly in the Python shell running on
my desktop computer and the reason for
that is will get more accurate timing
measurements you can try running timing
through the web browser interface that
provide the problem is there are limits
to how long we let your programs execute
and the timings won't be very accurate
so instead I'm going to run these in the
Python shell if you have Python
installed you can try this yourself and
we have some directions on the website
how you can do that but it's not
necessary to do that to continue in the
class I just want to demonstrate how
time execution works so let's try a
simple example we're going to time the
execution of the expression 1 plus 1 so
that's doing a simple addition we're
adding two numbers we'll see how long
that takes and when we run time
execution we get back to results we get
back the result which is one plus one is
two that's good and is the second result
we get the time it took a little hard to
read so it looks like 8.3 and then e to
the negative five so what that means
that's using a scientific notation the
negative 05 is where the decimal point
is so what that is really looks like
this therefore zeros followed by the 83
dot dot and that's a value in the number
of seconds so the number of seconds it
took to run is 0 point 0 0 0 0 8 seconds
if we try the same thing again we'll try
timing the exact same thing we don't get
exactly the same result right the
timings inaccurate it depends on other
things going on on the machine we won't
get exactly the same answer but it's
still a very small number and if we try
it a few times we'll keep seeing this
ball number if we try a more complicated
addition it's still going to give us a
very small number and it's a small
number of microseconds the actual
processor time for something that simple
is actually probably lower than that but
there's some other things happening
because we needed to stop and start the
clock and other things to do the timing
will see more if we try running longer
things so this won't tell us much
evaluating very simple very fast
evaluations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
