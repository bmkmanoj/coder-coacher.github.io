okay basically this means buying space
in a rack in a data center so you still
buy your own machines and you install
them in the Stata Center or maybe you
buy a whole rack or you buy a whole cage
but basically a lot of websites do this
the biggest ones have their own data
centers the biggest reason you do this
is you have control over the machines
you can build whatever machines you want
configure them however you want wire
them together however you want there are
your machines and you're renting the
space generally you pay for things like
rent to have your space and then you pay
for power and bandwidth you know I pay
for 30 amps or 60 amps you know the
power a couple machines in Iraq or you
may pay for many more to have a whole
cage you know of machines and you pay
for how much bandwidth you use you know
maybe you only need 10 Meg's a second or
maybe you need 10 geeks all the pens and
you have control over all of this
downside is there's a high amount of
work you have to actually administer
these machines you have to install
software you have to maintain them if
they break you have to replace them it's
a lot of effort so if you're not good at
sis admitting you know system
administration doing all that sort of
thing colocation is is a tough option if
you like doing that sort of thing you
can save some money by collocating or if
you're a big website with highly
specialized needs data centers are the
way to go few large websites don't
control their own machines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
