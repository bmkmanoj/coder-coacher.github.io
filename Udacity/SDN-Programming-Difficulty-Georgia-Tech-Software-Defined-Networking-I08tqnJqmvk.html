networking include traffic load balance
support for migrating virtual machines
in response to changing demands
adjusting server and traffic placement
to save power provisioning the network
when demands fluctuate and providing
various security guarantees particularly
in scenarios that involve multiple
tenants to understand these challenges
in a bit more detail let's take a look
at a typical data center of topology the
topology typically has three layers an
access layer which connects the servers
themselves an aggregation layer which
connects the axis later and then the
core historically the core of the
network has been connected with layer
three but increasingly modern data
centers are connected with an entire
layer two topology layer two topology
makes it easier to perform migration of
services from one part of the topology
to another since these services can stay
on the same layer to network and hence
would not need new IP addresses when
they moved it also becomes easier to
load balanced traffic on the other hand
a monolithic layer two topology makes
scaling difficult since now we have tens
of thousands of servers on a single flat
topology in other words layer 2
addresses are not topological so the
forwarding tables in these switches
can't scale as easily because they can't
take advantage of the natural hierarchy
that exists in the topology other
problems that exist in this type of
topology is that the hierarchy can
potentially create single points of
failure and links at the top of the
topology in the core can become
oversubscribed modern data center
network operators have observed that as
you move from the bottom of the
hierarchy up towards the core that the
links at the top can carry as much as
200 times as much traffic as the links
at the bottom of the hierarchy so
there's a serious capacity mismatch
in that the top part of the topology has
to carry a whole lot more traffic than
the bottom we'll explore how modern data
center network architectures address
these various challenges but let's first
take a quick look at one way of solving
the scale problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
