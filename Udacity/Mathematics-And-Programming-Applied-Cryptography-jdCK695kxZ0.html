to answer a session I'm job the
assistant structure for the class and
i'm here with dave our instructor hi it
looks like there's been a lot of
activity on the forums and some
interesting questions answer so let's
get started looking at some of those
questions yeah our first question comes
from enca who wants to know how many the
questions on the future problem set and
the final exam will be primarily
programming you guys questions and how
many will be primarily mathematics based
so it's going to be a mix cryptography
is really a branch of mathematics so
there's a lot of math and crypto but we
also want to build things and we are
interested in programs in the computing
aspects of that so there will be
questions that either require you to
write a program or more often questions
where to solve them well you probably
have to write a program but the goal is
to solve the question not to write the
program for its own sake so there will
be a mix there'll be a few questions on
each homework that do involve writing
programs many that don't though and
those will be more involving the Memex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
