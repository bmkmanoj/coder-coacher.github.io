algorithms or at least some classes of
algorithms but before we do that I think
is useful to really ask a very simple
question which is exactly how hard is
this problem and to help to answer that
we're gonna do a quiz because you like
quizzes and I'm gonna define my terms
just a little bit better but maybe not
that much better so here's the quiz
you've got a set of data within features
and your goal is to find a subset of M
features where the size of that subset
is no greater than the original subset
which makes sense the original set of
features in which makes sense okay and
that's it and so what I want you to be
able to tell me is given this generic
problem of starting within features in
finding a subset of M features how long
does it take in terms of time complexity
to do is it linear quadratic polynomial
or exponential in in polynomial includes
linear quadratic so you mean sort of
polynomial that's not linear quadratic
that's right and I mean quadratic
doesn't that linear got it and I mean
exponential that's not polynomial or
quadratic or linear it's not well it
could be you could have 2 to the N + N
squared for example times 0 you could do
it don't mess with me man
ok so you got the problem just to just
to make sure I understand so so can you
draw like a rectangle like that's our
input space X ok so we've got some input
space X this is a rectangle and it's got
n features so those are like the columns
okay all right and we're gonna select a
subset M of those n features so we'll
have a like a skinnier matrix but not
shorter right all right
so and can I choose any way I want to to
define what subsets I like better than
which other subsets because then I could
do this really fast so what we're gonna
do is there's going to be some function
let's just call it F okay which given a
set of features returns the score oh
that looks sort of familiar and this
function may be arbitrarily complicated
maybe really simple but you don't know
what it is oh all right then I think I
think I can answer this question now
okay so let's go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
