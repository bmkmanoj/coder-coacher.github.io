tree called a binary search tree a
binary search tree or BST is definitely
a binary tree that is every parent node
has at most two children but just as an
array is the type of list a BST is just
a type of binary tree there's a specific
rule for how the values associated with
each node are arranged bsts are sorted
so every value on the left of a
particular node is smaller than it and
every value on the right of a particular
node is larger than it because bsts have
this structure we can do operations like
search insert and delete pretty quickly
let's say we want to find seven we would
start at the root we see 7 is greater
than 5 so we go right next since our
next element is 8 we know our next move
is left and in just a few steps we found
it you may have noticed that we didn't
need to search every element to figure
out where the one I was looking for
belonged
we just had to look at one value in each
level of the tree and then we can make a
decision with just a comparison to my
element that means the runtime of a
search on a BST is just the height of
the tree which we proved was log n when
we learned about inserting inserting in
a binary tree is pretty much the same
process you start at the top and you can
make quick decisions about where to look
at each step by comparing to the element
you want to add eventually you'll hit
that open spot in the tree as long as
you compared your element correctly at
each step you can put your new element
there and not violate the core BST
properties deleting is yet again a bit
complicated
however it's complicated in the same way
that it was for the generic binary tree
so those solutions for different cases
still apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
