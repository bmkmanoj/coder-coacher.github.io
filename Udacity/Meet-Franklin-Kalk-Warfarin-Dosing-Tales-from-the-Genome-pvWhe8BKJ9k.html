years old i live in Austin Texas I took
warfarin for six months about three
years ago I had a blood clot probably
due to heavy travel there were no other
complicating symptoms or at least that
was what we surmised at the time now
when you say you had a blood clot that
you know to anyone who hasn't had a
blood clot before that sounds kind of
serious is that serious it is and it was
kind of an interesting I mean I'll tell
you the long version right it started
out I in retrospect probably for several
months I had some developing issues but
didn't really know it at the time but
looking back after after I discovered it
it became pretty clear that I had you
know it had these these symptoms you
know I didn't really know anything about
blood clots I have to say I wasn't
educated about them at all I a little
better educated now of course but at the
time I really didn't know anything once
the pain move from my calf to my groin I
kind of you know figured out oh wait a
minute this isn't just a muscle pull and
it's really tender I mean you I couldn't
touch it without it being pretty painful
so you know that was a little bit you
know muscle pulls don't really feel that
way when muscle pull a few you know if
you're really massage maybe okay but I
mean just you know light touch I could
feel it so it was something different
after you had the heparin treatment and
you're able to sort of bust up the
initial clot right and the war firm was
prescribed to essentially prevent clots
from forming crew a period of time in
the future right now is this a pill that
you had to take every day well first off
is it a pill and it's sort of thing you
have to take every day right it's a pill
you take it every day and I'm trying to
remake aunt remember exactly whether I
actually took more than one in a day to
ramp up to some level or not I
remember but it took about two weeks to
determine that I was stable on it that
my my clotting factors were at a normal
level and not varying a lot because
that's one of the things they look for
so I had to get you know blood tests
every every twice a week for two weeks
and then every week after that but it's
a pill and you know long term over six
months I took it once a day and so
obviously i guess the concern is since
the war in itself modulates the clotting
factors and how effective and efficient
they work for you that too much warfarin
could be a bad thing absolutely so when
your doctor prescribed this for you what
were the considerations that went into I
mean did he have lots of special
instructions for you did he try to get a
lot of information from you did you have
to modify anything in your life
accommodate the dosing yes all of the
above he gave me some fairly they
weren't super detailed but fairly
detailed instructions I you know once I
discovered and had verified at the
doctrine that I had a clot and that I
was you know because these shots will
remind you of nothing else because
compared to the shots the warfarin
itself was not really a big deal for me
in terms of the you know the ingestion
sure more or less cursorily went over
the instructions with me rather than go
through them word by word because he
knew i had read them and had begun to
educate myself and i was lucky because
my personal physician was also my
next-door neighbor so he knew my
lifestyle and knew that i was going to
be you know pretty diligent about
understanding this you know this
condition well what were some of the
special exceptions we know that vitamin
k is really important rather the amounts
of vitamin K vitamin K is an essential
component for clotting right well did
you have to alter your diet or did you
have to pay special attention to it yes
so before and this is another
interesting sort of pre determining
factor I think not just the travel but I
ate a lot of leafy green vegetables
which have those are really the main
sources in our normal diet of vitamin K
for example iceberg lettuce doesn't have
much but Romain does right kale has an
enormous amount spinach I love spinach I
ate a lot of spinach before that so I
had to cut back and I really I didn't
eliminate them from my diet but I cut
way back and I did control very
carefully the intake so I I knew exactly
how much I was taking each day there
were some things I totally eliminated
from my diet for example avocados and
the reason for that is avocados you can
have two avocados that look the same but
yet one will have very little vitamin K
and the other can have an enormous
amount per unit weight so the
variability was just it's something that
you know you would you just imagine well
I'm not going to eat those then right
because I don't want to inject that kind
of variability into my diet in fact when
I had the weekly blood test one thing I
noticed right away was that the bleeding
did not stop just a little pinprick and
the finger is what was needed to get the
blood test taking so you know you can
usually just do this with your fingers
for 23 minutes and then the blood will
stop right but it would take 30 minutes
or more because you know we were trying
to keep my blood relatively thin the
other thing the other lifestyle change
for me was I like to drive cars fast at
the racetrack and I couldn't do that
anymore because of the concern about
blunt force trauma any kind of accident
you know if you have a bad bridge you
could you know potentially bleed to
death if your blood doesn't clot well so
you know that's that's the kind of thing
that you know really was a big change
for me for me personally I stopped
traveling for about six to eight weeks
and then after that I remember still the
first aircraft I got on I was fidgeting
and it was Austin to Dallas you know
literally a 35-minute flight and then I
went Dallas to Milwaukee so maybe an
hour right not very far I was fidgeting
the whole time just trying to
keep my blood sugar I mean it was it's
it really changes your attitude I mean
for me it was my first glimpse of
mortality idea so I mean that was that
was a big deal and I think also you know
just having to go through a dietary
change for the first time in my life and
strictly control my diet you know my
attitude had always been I'll eat as
much as I want anything I want I'll just
exercise to keep my weight you know
where i want it it wasn't like that
anymore so that was a big change and you
know it was a big change for my family
because now all of a sudden if we were
if they were going to have kale or
spinach I wasn't so it was almost like
we had to cook for two different diets
right so I mean it just things like that
I mean that was that was part of it but
I think also there was probably some
worry you know from the other family
members about you know is dad okay or my
husband okay right well when i read
about warfarin i thought you know a
couple things it's almost like aspirin
it was discovered quite a while ago
early in the last century and maybe
1930s or 20s it's amazing that such an
effective drug has not really had yet a
replacement that works kind of for
everybody you know what I mean that was
interesting to me because it has been
used really for other purposes than
treating blood clots before that at
first I thought I'm not sure I want to
put this in my body but it really wasn't
all that bad the actual ingestion of the
of the drug itself I really felt nothing
and you know I felt perfectly normal so
that was good and I think they're you
know don't fear right on the other hand
for me i stabilized rapidly and and you
know my my clotting factor levels in my
blood state very constant over time
maybe that was just discipline so my
advice would be follow a diet you know
be really strict about your diet that
doesn't mean you know deprive yourself
but but be consistent with it so that
your
your your body is being presented with
the same chemistry from nutrition I mean
I think that's really important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
