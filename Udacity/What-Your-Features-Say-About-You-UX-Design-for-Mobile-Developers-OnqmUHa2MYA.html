with the perfect pizza app for Android
what were your top three features be my
top three features with the seasonal
recommendations because I think people
really like to order new things all the
time and why not take advantage of
seasonal ingredients the second thing I
would choose would be filtered
ingredient list but some people have
food preferences like they can't eat
gluten or they're vegans so just remove
stuff that they can't eat completely off
the menu just don't do it in and third
would be Google Wallet because this is
for Android and that's the primary way
people pay for stuff on Android so no
that's my desk so so what about you what
would your what do you think of top
three features for this app should be
for me they're actually live a different
my number one feature would be one-click
ordering because I think that the user
would really enjoy very quickly ordering
a pizza for the first time and also
coming back and making repeat orders the
second feature I would pick is order
history this would allow someone to find
out what they placed an order for before
and see how much money they're spending
on pizza okay and finally I think that
the user would really appreciate
real-time status updates ah because I
know that if they're hungry and they
want their pizza delivered they would
want to know where it is and when it's
gonna get there perfect so looking at
these features it kind of seems like the
three features you picked are classic
you because you're a creature of habit
you always order the same food every
single time so you get back to coding
you think of food as fuel
I do think of Woody's yes and order
history you're like super detailed with
your finances so that gonna make sense
for you good point and status updates
you're always checking like every five
seconds when your package is gonna
arrive so you know I'm noticing a trend
here that these are this kind of sounds
like the nas mole beats app it does it's
funny you mention that because your
features reflect very much who you are
like you are a foodie yeah you're
extremely picky about what you eat and
so the seasonal recommendations make
sense and also the menu filtering is a
good option for you because you are
don't like gluten yeah
and and the Google Wallet makes sense
because you are a super fan Android user
you know these features are kind of
classically so what are your favorite
features and how do they reflect on who
you are are they classic you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
