is the N one story the Enron story is so
interesting the Enron story is the
largest case of corporate fraud in
American history well that's what it is
so Enron was an energy trading company
that in around the year 2000 or so was
one of the top ten largest companies in
America huge company they had their
fingers and all kinds of different
projects and by the middle of 2002 it
was gone it was bankrupt there were
dozens of people in jail there was
billions of dollars tens of thousands of
people's jobs that were poof and as you
might suspect when something like this
happens a multi-billion dollar company
just collapses it didn't happen totally
organically there was a lot of fraud
that was going on underneath the surface
in some ways it was amazing that the
company didn't go bankrupt even earlier
than that considering how much fraud was
going on well it's that super
interesting so why is it relevant for
this class it is relevant for this class
because as it turns out Enron has had
sort of a second life in the form of one
of the most famous data sets of all time
and the data set that we'll be using
sort of to motivate a lot of our
projects in the rest of this class it's
called the Enron corpus and it's tens of
thousands of emails hundreds of
thousands of email so really minutes per
real people real emails by real people
it's um it's one of the it's as far as
I'm aware the biggest corpus of real
emails that sort of exist in the wild
it's exist in the open I guess in their
own the open that's right because emails
are usually so confidential right um and
so it's been used for many many
different purposes and we'll be using it
to answer a very interesting question in
this class I want to use this corpus to
try to figure out if there are patterns
within the emails of people who were
persons of interest in the fraud case
see if we can identify this oh these are
like real emails for real people and if
they have an affair you find an email in
their misappropriated money you'll find
anything yeah yeah yeah all this yo you
can you see everything um in fact one of
the things that was very interesting to
me I as I was learning about sort of the
Enron fraud case and I was reading
newspaper articles and watching watching
documentaries you get a sense for some
of these individuals and exactly the
roles that they were playing in this
fraud and
to go in and actually read their emails
is a very weird experience so yes it's
so that's the case of the past right but
does machine learning is always about
the future why is it interesting to go
to this email corpus and find petals of
fraud like who would care the thing that
I love about this project is while this
data set has been out in the world and
very famous for the last decade or so no
one's ever actually tried to answer this
particular question can we identify
patterns in the emails of people who
were who would care about this is the
NSA are you working for the NSA I care
about I think it's a really interesting
question that's the thing is that is
that this is at least for my case it's a
it's a case of curiosity of course if
you were as some kind of forensic
machine learning expert you might this
might actually not be a case of the pass
for you you might be really interested
in trying to answer this question it
might have real-world implications for
me I'm just I'm just perversely curious
so Katie you've done experiments on the
data already on y'all so what did you do
what worked what didn't work well that's
basically going to be what I'll be
teaching for the rest of the class I'll
be a lot of the projects all of the mini
projects in fact are going to be coming
back to this and round corpus as I'm
trying to understand things about it and
using different machine learning
techniques to attack it from different
angles I've done a lot of smart things
and I've done a lot of very stupid
things and I've learned in the process
of this this exercise so one thing that
I will be doing also from here on out is
pointing out some of the places where
I've done something that that I didn't
realize at first but was kind of stupid
and how I figured out what my mistake
was and how I caught it so my hope is
that this is a little bit of watching a
machine learning exercise in practice
the in some ways I am two steps ahead of
you kind of machete my way through the
jungle but that the students are there
one step behind me and they're sort of
watching my thought process as its
unfolding as I'm trying to answer it so
what do you think the students will
learn from this data and and really
thinking they can apply it it's an
incredibly rich data set and there's a
there's a lot of places where we'll be
talking about things that have broad
application so the things we'll be
addressing in this coming
a few lessons for example we'll be
talking about regressions
so using regressions I was able to
understand the relationship between the
salaries of the people in Enron and
their bonuses and see if there were any
interesting relationships there as it
turns out I'm not sure that it has a lot
of implication for the fraud but it was
something that I found very interesting
we'll be looking at clustering you can
use clustering on the data which is a
type of unsupervised learning it's a
very interesting algorithm to figure out
who within this within this organization
was a member of the board of directors
and who was just a regular employee will
be using outlier detection and removal
to find certain lines in the data set
that were bugs basically that were
outliers that I had to go in and clean
out manually to make sure that we were
getting sensible results from our data
stuff like that great weight and
students were there basically watching
you do this or way they do it themselves
a little bit of both there are places
where there's something that I would
wrestle with for many days at a time
before I finally figured out what was
going wrong so my hope is that they will
not be wrestling quite as hard that as
I've learned some of these things I can
point them in the right direction but
for the most part it will be replicating
the steps that that I've been following
and coming up with the answers to the
questions that I've been curious about
and in terms of the skills of student
remembering this the skills that they
can take under the professional lives
like what are other examples because the
Enron data set is like one in a decade
and it's a specific one that was made
public for some specific legal action
right like what other things today can
the students use it for once they've
taken a specific example well it's a lot
of the topics that we'll be covering
will be using Enron as a use case but of
course that's not the only use case for
any of these things so let's use the
example of clustering so I said that
clustering will be using to identify the
difference between two people on the
board of directors and ordinary
employees at Enron but clustering is
something we have an interview coming up
with a vice-president and Netflix who's
very involved in their machine learning
and it Netflix what they do with
clustering is they actually identify
particular types of people by their
movie choices and so they can have
clusters of users that they say here's
here's the whatever 25
two thirty-five year old men who like to
watch action movies and comedies here's
the children who like to watch Disney
movies here's the women who like to
watch romances and these based on having
us figure out who they're yeah they're
taking us by analyzing the email of a
foreign organization that in past many
years ago
you can if you learn about movie
preferences of people and Netflix by
using the same algorithms yeah it's not
it's not too much of a stretch is there
are many different questions that you
can be asking and machine learning is a
tool that you're going to be using to
answer them so whichever whichever
direction you point that firehose in is
that's really exciting I'm I'm very
excited about this and there's one thing
that I do want to emphasize which is
that what we're trying to do with this
data set identifying persons of interest
in the fraud it hasn't ever been done
before as far as I'm aware and we picked
it because I think it's a really cool
problem not because I know that there's
an answer that's easy to find and so I
think it's very important that that
point be made because it there are lots
of things out there that would be easy
to solve and this isn't one of those
cases and in fact at the end if there's
a student who gets very into this and
really starts to dig into the data on
their own they could very easily become
more of an expert than than I am right
now so I really hope that there are
students out there who get as excited
about this as I am and and make it their
own project start to engineer their own
features come up with their own ideas
and figure out how to implement them
because while I'm setting a good example
I'm getting you off to a good start
there's no way that I'm covering all the
smart ideas that could solve this right
this is great Thank You Katie
