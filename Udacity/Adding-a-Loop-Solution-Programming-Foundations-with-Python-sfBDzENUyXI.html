to take three breaks throughout the day
I will use the break count variable to
keep count of the number of breaks I've
taken and then add a while loop to make
sure that this code runs three times by
the way if you want to see some
information on how while loops work
there is a helpful link in the
instructor notes now if I run this
program the program will read for ten
seconds and play the song and do that
three times
another handy addition to our program
can be a print statement that tells us
when our program began now how do I find
the current time when I have to do some
testing like this I start to use this
output window so I can import time here
which as you may guess is a way to
access time and I know there is a
function called C time or current time
that seems like the current time on my
computer great back to the main program
where I will add this let me save and
run this program now as soon as I run
the program I get a prompt suggesting
when I started the program ten seconds
after that a video is played which asks
me to take a break
so far so good another 10 seconds passed
by and another suggestion to take a
break now if I want to stop this program
Midway I can either restart idle or use
control-c in the shell window which will
stop the execution of the program when
it comes back from sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
