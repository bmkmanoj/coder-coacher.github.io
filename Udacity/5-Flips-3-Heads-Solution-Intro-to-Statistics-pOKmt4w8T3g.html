proofs once I can just flip heads and
tails so three heads means two tails I
can do the exact same game as before
where place tails as opposed to heads
and it gives me the same equation as
before but let's do it the new way three
heads I can place five times four times
three the first heads the second and the
third for the first I have five
positions for the second for for the
third three are left this gives me the
combinatorics for those heads but now
I'm over counting how much I'm all of
accounting well suppose I'm committed to
put the three heads into these three
slots over here and that's not a given
and now just wondering watch order I put
them in so I might put if the first one
here the first one near the first one
here then for the first fun placed in
here there's no three different ways of
placing it for the second one there's
two different ways of placing it for the
third one it's not deterministic this
was one slot left so I over counted by a
factor of six there's six different ways
of placing these three heads with these
few slots so the result is 5 times 4
times 3 over 3 times 2 times 1 gives me
5 times 2 equals 10 and that is
insightful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
