proofs - I can just flip heads and tails
so three heads means two tails I can do
the exact same game as before where
plays tails as opposed to heads and it
gives me the same equation as before but
let's do it the new way three heads I
can play this five times four times
three the first heads the second and the
third for the first I have five
positions for the second four for the
third three are left this gives me the
combinatoric s' for those heads but now
I'm over counting how much I'm over
counting well suppose I'm committed to
put the three heads in with these three
slots over here and that's not a given
and now I just wonder in what order I
put them in so I might put if the first
one here the first one here the first
one here then for the first one placed
in here there's no three different ways
of placing it for the second one there's
two different ways of placing it for the
third one it's not deterministic this
was one slot left so I over counted by a
factor of six there's six different ways
of placing these three heads with these
three slots so the result is 5 times 4
times 3 over 3 times 2 times 1 gives me
5 times 2 equals 10 and that is
