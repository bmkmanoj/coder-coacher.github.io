for shifting it only applies if we have
a dot in front of a token so we have
sort of two possible worlds here this
has a dot in front of nothing and this
has a dot in front of a token we're
definitely going to use the dot in front
of the token and then we need to look at
that token and it better match the next
part of the input so we haven't seen
anything yet is the next token and open
paranthesis oh it is we're so happy this
is going to work out perfectly send
conceptually what I do is just shift my
finger over one it's just a step to the
right so let's go see which one of those
that looks like it should have this dot
moved in inside the parenthesis well
this does not quite match it doesn't
have the parenthesis at all this
represents using the wrong rule over
here we've got the right rule but we
didn't move the dot this is just the
parse par state we started with
previously so that's not the result of
shifting this however this is looking
very promising we've moved the dot over
one so now it's inside and we haven't
changed this starting offset we're going
to put this in chart state 1 and this
information assumes we started with 0
tokens then we saw this left parenthesis
and here's where we are now finally in
this last one we've mistakenly updated
the starting position or the from
information and this would correspond to
some other hypothetical input where we
had already seen one token and now we've
seen one more open parenthesis and we're
expecting to see a few more that's not
the input we're currently given this
doesn't match there are no hidden tokens
to the left that aren't shown in the
rule</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
