implementations interact with the
coherence protocol and what performance
do they achieve let's look at three
cores 0 1 and 2 let's first try to do
this with atomic exchange instructions
core 0 let's say tries to grab the log
first and it succeeds it does an atomic
exchange gets that the lock was free the
lock VAR is now going to be in the
modified state in the cache of course 0
and it's going to not be present in
corwin and core tools caches now
eventually core 0 which grab the lock
will unlock by writing 0 to the lock bar
but the question is what happens
meanwhile encore 1 and core to both
corwin and core two might want to also
enter the same critical section let's
say core one tries first it does an
exchange of r1 and lock war see that
lock bar is 1 so it didn't grab the lock
but because there was a right to lock
war there is a transfer of l'acqua into
this cache where it's now modified and
now lock bar is invalid in core zeros
cash let's say that core 0 now does its
own exchange does the same thing tries
to grab the locks is that it's one will
try again but because it did the right
to lock bar now it grabs the block in
the modified State and core one gets it
in invalid state and in Corsa rate stays
invalid and now as long as the lock is
busy these two will be spinning in that
loop so what's going to happen is this
block will move many many times between
their caches each time causing
communication on the shared bus and each
time spending a lot of power none of
this activity here will actually succeed
in grabbing the lock until the lock bar
becomes 0 so at some point let's say
that core one was the last one to grab
the lock at the point where rock clock
what is written 20 this right will cause
yet another movement of the block it
becomes modified in
or zeros cash now and now whoever tries
to grab the lock first will succeed by
obtaining the block writing to it but
this time grabbing the log so if core
one now succeeds in grabbing the lock
after it became available core 2
continues this activity further so there
is a lot of this going on as long as
anybody's waiting on a lock this is very
power hungry because these movements of
data between caches are going to cost us
a lot of energy per transfer and also
this activity here keeps the
interconnect between the course busy for
example the shared bus so the one chord
that is actually doing useful work here
while this is going on if it has a cache
miss will now be slower in handling desk
cache miss because it has to wait for
the busy bus that these two are keeping
busy so not only is it power-hungry to
do this it also by busy waiting in such
an active way we're slowing down the
useful work that is the only thing that
can really result in us actually getting
the lock eventually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
