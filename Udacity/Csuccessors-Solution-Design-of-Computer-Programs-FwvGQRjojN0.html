solution is a list of deltas of
differences in the states that
correspond to these moves so what do I
mean by that one thing we can do is send
two missionaries from aside with a boat
to the other side that would be a
difference of two in the missionaries we
would add two to one side and subtract
two from the other side and not changed
at all the number of cannibals and
change the number of boats by one or we
could send two cannibals or we could
send one of each or we could send only
one missionary are cannibals so there's
five possible moves basically depending
on where the boat is and that's what see
successor says first we check for states
with no successors if there are more
cannibals than missionaries but there
are some missionaries then they're going
to get eaten and so we return the empty
dictionary as a result otherwise we're
going to collect up number of items in
our dictionary and we're going to do
that by going through these deltas and
subtracting the deltas from the side
where the boat is and adding them in to
the other side and we have two
directions we can go from left right
start to the other side or from the
other side back to the original side and
I made use here of vector addition and
subtraction so I take the current state
which is six numbers and I add or
subtract these deltas and that's what
these definitions say now it would be
nice that this type of vector arithmetic
was built into Python and there and
there are versions of called numeric
Python where you can do that but here I
had to write these functions myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
