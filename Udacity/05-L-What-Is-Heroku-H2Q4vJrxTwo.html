application your code needs to run on a
server that will respond to requests
over the Internet but where does Heroku
come in well
Heroku will take your application code
and make it accessible on the internet
with a few simple commands Heroku is a
platform service for you the developer
to upload your code and make your
application accessible to everyone this
is called a platform as a service and is
one kind of Internet product available
today along with infrastructure and
software as a service you might see
these shortened to pass gas and fast
what is special about past products is
how simple they make it for you to host
your application online
Heroku handles most of the details
behind the scenes that are required for
your application to run before services
like Heroku many developers would have
to manage and maintain their own servers
there are hardware requirements software
installation and security features in
the physical location where the service
or house these and many more things need
to happen for an application to run
smoothly online to deploy an application
on Heroku all you need is a few simple
command-line tools installed and your
application code ready to deploy
services like Heroku handle all these
background tasks for you making it much
simpler for developers to release a live
application this allows you the
developer to focus on writing code that
works and letting the deployment
platform handle all the rest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
