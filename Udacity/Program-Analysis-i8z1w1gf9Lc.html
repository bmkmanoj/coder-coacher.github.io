has all the properties we want namely
concurrency absence of deadlock and
mutual exclusion of the important shared
memory does it have concurrency for this
we just need to convince ourselves that
the critical sections of the code are
short this critical section here is just
decrementing a variable and sending a
signal not much work to be done there
and the tracker does the analogous thing
so we're okay on that front the top two
box just this one and this one these
just check the condition and then call
the wait procedure and then the
immediately unlocked afterwards so this
also is short okay so let's check off
concurrency so the absence of deadlock
we can convince ourselves that both
threads are never blocked we can see
that the mutex lock can't be responsible
for a deadlock because both the producer
and the consumer give up the lock
writing after acquiring it just as we
argued about concurrency there isn't
much work to be done here nor is there
much going on up here it's just a matter
of checking the value of the buffa bail
variable that leaves the possibility
that we get blocked on one of these con
wait calls let's suppose that a
digitizer is blocked on this line
because he's waiting for buff avail to
be greater than zero let's suppose that
the digitizer is blocked because he's
waiting for a signal saying that buff
avail is greater than zero we know that
right after Conway it was called buff
available zero remember we had the lock
at the time this means that the tracker
can't possibly be blocked on its weight
because that would imply that buff avail
were equal to max' we also know that our
digitizer unlocked the mutex variable
again that's part of the con wait call
hence our tracker can't be blocked on
this while he tries to acquire the lock
either eventually the tracker will get
around to incrementing buff avail and
then sending the signal back to the
digitizer thread and so we can be
confident that eventually this signal
will arrive and will exit this procedure
the argument is analogous if we suppose
that the tracker is waiting on con wait
that means that digitizer will be able
to make progress and eventually
decrement
buf avail and send the signal alright so
hopefully we've convinced ourselves that
there's no deadlock vastly we want to
convince ourselves that we have achieved
mutual exclusion of the necessary shared
memory well the use of these mutex locks
around all the accesses and rights to
buff avail should convince ourselves
that we don't have a race there that
leaves the frame buff variable but the
logic of the program that is the logic
of the ring buffer that we talked about
earlier prevents the head from ever
catching up at the tail or vice-versa as
they chased each other around the ring
buffer in fact that's the whole point of
the buff avail variable so mutual
exclusion is achieved and in our program
has all three properties that we desired</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
