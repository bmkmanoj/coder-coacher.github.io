out Eliza's to-do list and it probably
looks somewhat like this a counter
starts at one it goes up to six we do
some work we increment the counter keep
on doing it until the counter has
reached its end there's nothing wrong
with it but if you think about it the
three statements that control the
counter the initialization the check and
the update they're spread all over the
loop the for loop is there to organize
it a bit more neatly
here is the basic outline of the full
loop it has three slots and we fill in
the right statements in each one of them
and I'll demonstrate that in this low
check way we'll cut out the
initialization the condition and the
update I'm gonna put them in the right
slot initialization goes here
the condition goes here and the update
goes here now you seek they're all
neatly together in the header of the for
loop let's have a quick look at the
control flow we start with the
initialization then we check the
condition we go into the inside of the
loop then we do the update and now the
counter is two we check the condition we
go into the inside of the loop we do the
update now the counter is three we check
the condition we go and say it's a loop
we do the update we check the condition
we go and save the loop we do the update
check the condition go and save to loop
do the update and eventually the
condition is false and we leave the loop
notice that the initialization happens
once the check happens before entering
the loop and the update happens after
finishing an iteration of the loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
