embedded within it it doesn't have
visual controls along the map that allow
me to do things such as zoom in and out
but I can actually pinch the map if I
want to zoom here you can see I'm
zooming in and here you can see I'm
zooming out
it also has data such as country names
you can see here the United States
country name as well as the states in
the United States and cities and also
here we can see Mexico as a country name
so a lot of the data is already
available on this map for me and I'll
show Shirley how I built this and it was
very very simple very straightforward
and I'm effectively getting all this
data for free if i zoom in on a specific
location
like right now I'm gonna zoom in on the
Silicon Valley area and we begin to see
town names and if I get in even closer
we'll begin to see street names here you
can see West El Camino rayel we can seal
Adams streets this is right here is
where I'm recording and if i zoom even
closer we'll begin to see individual
buildings here we can see buildings
appearing across the road from here as a
shopping mall and actually some
buildings when I zoom right into them I
begin to see some of the details of the
interior of the building so here we can
see I have a department store very close
to me and I'm beginning to see the
sections within department store
including the fact that they put the
bakery right beside the intimate apparel
now all of this data came with the maps
without me needing to write anything I
just added the map to an Android app
with the default customization it's very
very simple to do and in the next few
minutes you're actually going to build
this exact app and it will give you the
foundation for building much more
complex and interesting mapping apps
later in this course so let's get
started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
