HTTP responses with netcat and printf
it's a big deal because printf doesn't
know anything about the network and that
cat doesn't know anything about forming
HTTP requests hole nut cat is doing is
connecting to a port and sending a
string over it to the webserver that
string happens to look like an HTTP
request and so the server responds now
net cat is a lower-level tool than
something like curl or a web app API for
that matter what we've done here is to
separate out two different layers of
activity the text of the HTTP request
and the connect to a port transmits some
data and get some results part in
everyday software the HTTP layer is
implemented by a program such as web
browsers and servers whereas the lower
layer TCP is implemented in the
operating system the NC command is a
thin wrapper over TCP now there are
several different layer models for
talking about network protocols in this
course we'll be using the IETF model
which looks like this the top layer is
the application layer protocol such as
HTTP or SSH our application protocols
concepts we see at this layer are things
like URLs passwords the head command
server headers web pages things that
make sense to specific applications such
as web browsers or SSH clients
application protocols are based on
protocols at the transport layer like
TCP and UDP these provide things like
port numbers transport layer protocols
are based on the internet layer which is
basically the same as the one single
protocol IP it's at this layer that we
start talking about things like IP
addresses and routes and IP in turn runs
on top of different kinds of hardware
like Wi-Fi or Ethernet or DSL lines
layers above this don't need to worry
about things like how strong is my
wireless signal each of these layers
depends on the one below it and provides
particular guarantees to the layers
above it you can think of them as
offering and using ap is separating out
specific concerns and making it possible
to reuse features like both HTTP and SSH
have some of the same needs they need
the idea of making a
connection to a server and those needs
are bundled into the TCP layer now this
layer model isn't perfect there are a
bunch of network protocols that don't
exactly fit into any of these layers but
even with these added to the picture you
can notice that while all of these
things above depend on IP and IP can
depend on various things underneath it
IP itself is the only thing on its layer
some folks refer to this as the narrow
waist of the Internet Protocol stack
because everything above and below goes
through IP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
