peace the ability to I guess live a
fulfilled life it's more what you feel
what you can bring to others and not so
much what you see they kind of bounce
their eyes get all happy their ears kind
of go up they get all loose like their
body language is real loose and yeah
their tails wag like he's happy right
now how would you measure it oh I don't
know I don't measure nothing really
I just I'm happy I think I probably
measured by the number of times I smile
every day I have no idea I'd have to
think about that for a second there
their attitude they're just the way they
are personally if I was a researcher and
I wanted to know how well you remembered
something how could I do that if you're
talking about like say scientific
experimentation to have a control or
some sort you could film the experience
that a person has and then interview
that person maybe have multiple people
to interview so you get different points
of view for the same event and see how
that differs how would you define memory
it's an accumulation of information they
far more important is how you apply that
how you use it
I'm the ability to retrieve information
from your past I have to think about it
things I bother to remember for later
use how would you define itchiness
discomfort yeah just just general
discomfort something that's irritating
you and you have this you have to
scratch it the intensity of the itch
would match the time length of
scratching with the amount that they
move around you could ask a very forward
question like is there something you we
need to you need me to scratch right now
that sounds a little personal very close
friend maybe you could do that so kind
of like happiness if you had to measure
how it
your dog was right now how would you do
that I would do quantum AI I definitely
go with like how often they were
scratching or how often they were doing
sort of a full body shake how would you
measure stress I think you could measure
stress by obviously there's I'm sure
medical ways that you could measure
stress me yeah are the frown on my face
I mean my mouth I mean heartbeats
probably the blood rushing to the head</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
