and motion this is often called a
measurement update and it's often called
prediction and the update will use Bayes
rule which is nothing else but a product
or a multiplication in this update we'll
use total probability which is a
convolution or simply in addition let's
talk first about the measurement cycle
and then the prediction cycle using our
great-great-great gaussians for
implementing those steps so suppose
you're localizing another vehicle and
you have a prior distribution it looks
as follows it's a very right Gaussian
with the mean over here and now say we
get a measurement that tells us
something about the localization of
vehicle and it comes in like this it has
a mean over here called new and this
example has a much smaller covariance
for the measurement this is an example
when our prior we were fairly uncertain
about location but the measurement told
us quite a bit as to where the vehicle
is so here's a quiz for you with the new
mean of the subsequent Gaussian be over
here over here or over here check one of
these three boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
