kick off this lesson and one of my
favorite spots in Atlanta piedmont park
this area used to be a dilapidated
fairgrounds but then sometime in the
early 1900's it was transformed into the
lovely and public open space that you
see today this transformation by the way
was done by the brothers Olmstead sons
of Frederick Law Olmsted whom you might
know is the lead landscape architect of
Central Park in New York City okay but
why are we here well this lesson is
about parallelizing computations on the
heart and soul of computer science data
structures but we you're going to learn
a bunch of tricks for extracting
parallelism from tree computations these
include for example taking the tree
converting it into a line and then
parallelizing operations on the line now
at some point in this process you and I
are going to get a little bit stuck so
instead of trying to figure out what to
do we're going to reach for a classic
trick in the lazy computer scientists
tool box called randomization or more
simply flipping coins ah what do you
mean in addition to the videos there's
also a reading so be sure that you do
both and while you're busy doing that
I'm going to go off and feed the ducks
which is probably illegal and then I'm
going to take a nap so good luck to you
and wake me when you're done
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
