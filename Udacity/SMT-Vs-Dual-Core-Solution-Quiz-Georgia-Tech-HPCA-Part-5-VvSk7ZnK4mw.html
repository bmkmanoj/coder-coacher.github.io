quiz we have a floating-point intensive
thread it's going to use pretty much
these two issue slots and very rarely
use these and then we have an integer
only thread that only gets to use these
two so with a dual core processor one of
the cores really gets to be to issue
plus maybe a little bit another one gets
to be just to issue because it never
sees floating-point instructions that it
needs to have more than to issue in SMT
however we would be able to do two
instructions from this thread and two
instructions from this thread per cycle
so we will getting very similar
performance and as we have seen then
this is the more effective approach
because the cost that we are getting
here versus here is significantly lower
so we get similar performance for almost
half the cost here now what will happen
however if we didn't have a
floating-point intensive thread and
instead got two of these in that case
the two core is slightly more cost
effective because it gets the to issue
performance in each core for twice the
cost of one core whereas this gets us
the performance of a single core because
both of these are sharing the two issue
slots for a cost that is more than one
core so in that case this would be the
more cost-effective options so as you
can see it's not that SMT always wins
over multiple cores it's that it depends
on exactly what types of programs we
have and exactly what's the distribution
of issue slots among units and how
different applications are using it so
the floating-point intensive and integer
only and this type of a split between
issue slots is an extreme example that
makes the SMT look really good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
