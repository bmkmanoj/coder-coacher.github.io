able to do is to compute statistics on
lists so imagine that we've got a set of
n nodes and we've got L which is a list
of values one for each of the nodes in
the network and we want to compute
statistics but what are statistics I
mean statistic is actually quite a
simple idea it's just a number that
summarizes a list of numbers so we have
if we have a list L say a list of the
centrality scores there's lots of
different statistics that we can imagine
some work that that would summarize this
list of numbers for example how many
numbers are in the list what's the
largest number in the list what's the
total of all the scores in the list how
many scores are in the list that are
between two and three inclusive so these
are all different statistics and some of
these are maybe more useful than others
but there's lots of different statistics
that we might want to compute and in
general when you're doing an analysis of
large structures like social networks
you need some way of summarizing this
large amount of data you can't just
present the data in a raw form it's too
much for people to think of all at once
so statistics and computing statistics
ends up being a really important
operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
