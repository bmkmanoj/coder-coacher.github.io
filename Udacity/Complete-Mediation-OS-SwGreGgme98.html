or or we have that because of one other
thing the operating system does so at
user level we have what we call virtual
resources we don't have physical
resources there is no way for user code
to actually name or react be able to to
you know target their physical resource
or ask for a physical resource there you
have only virtual resources and the
operating system actually gives you an
API on how those virtual resources can
be used an example of this is that for
storing persistent data we have file
abstraction or virtual resource for
storing persistent data is a file so you
you don't access a disk block the
operating system does disk i/o and
schedules requests to read blocks and
services interrupts and things like that
it can interact with the disk controller
through those privileged instructions we
are talking about but you cannot from
user space you can only ask for you know
access to files either opening them or
reading them by writing them and things
like that so you know at the user level
we don't understand now we don't have
ways of directly talking to the disk
controller the low-level hardware
functions that the operating system has
access to we only have these virtual
resources as a result of that remember
virtual resources are what the name says
they are not the real resources they had
to be implemented using physical
resource a file has to be implemented
with bunch of disk blocks okay where the
file data is stored so the virtual
resource has to be translated to
physical handles or resources for
example buffers where file data is
stored and things like that and this
translation is done from virtual to
physical implementation is done by the
operating system if you want to access a
disk block or a page of memory you have
to start with either a file descriptor
or you start with a logical physical
address we are talking about or a
virtual address and the translation from
virtual to physical is the first step
before you can get to the physical only
the operating system
knows how to do that or has the metadata
or has the control information that can
be used for this translation so with
this level of sort of indirection that
we add where you have one kind of name
namespace and the underlying resources
have a different name space and the
translation can only be done by the
physical by the by the operating system
with the trusted computing base well
that helps you get complete mediation
because you first need to go have that
translation done okay then you have to
go to the trusted computing base so it
gets the complete mediation gets
implemented right then and there because
you're coming to it and asking for a
physical resource so it could be the
reference monitor it can check at that
point that whatever that you're asking
for do you have access to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
