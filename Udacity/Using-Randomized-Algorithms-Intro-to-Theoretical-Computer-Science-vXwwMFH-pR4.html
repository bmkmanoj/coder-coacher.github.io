randomized algorithms and of course any
analogy can be criticized at one point
or the other but I think it fits rather
well if you use a randomized algorithm
without having any guarantees well first
of all at a certain point in time you
have to determine that it's the last
round
you're not running the algorithm any
further you've run it 200 times 2,000
times but then at a certain point you
just have to say okay this is it this is
going to be the result that I use and it
might be that the last 400 500 times or
in this case 40 times the algorithm has
not found a better solution it has found
one that seems very good and the
solution has not improved so at a
certain point in time you're just going
to decide well it's likely that this is
a very good solution now here's the
thing where the analogy actually does
not hold because if you think about it
when we're dealing with an np-complete
problem the chances of winning are not
5/6 over here indeed we're playing a
game with exponentially small
probability of winning so it's like this
when you run a randomized algorithm
without guarantees you're playing a game
with bad odds you don't really
understand what's going on and in the
end even though you run the algorithm
multiple times you only have one shot of
getting it right at the point that you
decide you're to stop your algorithm so
should you run a randomized algorithm
without any guarantees I think the rules
are almost the same as the one for this
game here so if the stakes aren't very
high so the problem you're trying to
solve is maybe not that important and
you're willing to take that risk then
you can do it and sometimes it's the
only possible way but I think that an
algorithm with guarantees is almost
always preferable first of all you know
what's going on and secondly and I think
that's also very important to emphasize
in order to get these guarantees here
you have to construct an intelligent
algorithm so rather than just poking all
the way around you're poking
intelligently it's almost the same as
with a search tree so just using
randomness in a way is brute force only
that and this time it's random force and
I think the name already says how
powerful that is
but when you have guarantees you're
directing that random force in a certain
direction and that of course tends to
improve your results dramatically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
