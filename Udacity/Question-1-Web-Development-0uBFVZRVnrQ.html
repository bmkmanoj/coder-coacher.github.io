unfortunately Steve couldn't be here
this week he is at a wedding rehearsal
right now so we're gonna I'm going to
handle your questions for him I already
talked to him about them and let's just
dive right in we had a lot of great
questions
and there was a lot of overlap with them
so the first one that I'm going to talk
about is about HTML templates what they
are how to use them when you should use
them and all of that the HTML templates
we're using are called Jinja that's the
templating engine it's included an app
engine which is nice because you don't
have to install anything extra the
Django template again j'en is also
included if you'd like to try out that
out at least according to the docs
that's included in the template engine
we haven't used that and we're not going
to go over that we weren't planning on
going over templates a whole lot but it
sounds like there is quite a bit of
demand for that so we'll try to put
something together I'm going to link to
the Jinja Doc's in the supplementary
material under the videos so by the time
you see this they should be there
templates are way to organize your HTML
in a way that's easier than string
substitution string substitution you can
get a little hairy once you get very
large HTML files and this helps you
manage them put them into separate files
and folders and Jinja is basically
glorified string substitution except
that it helps you handle separating
those out into multiple files and
folders so that you don't have to worry
about it as much but we're going to be
going into that in more depth later on
so to everyone who asked that thank you
apparently if there's a lot of interest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
