do with it well think about it what are
what are the things in a festival you
care about most what do you want to
track I want to know I mean know when
the festival is I want to know I know a
lot of things when it is who's going
I mean he's playing tickets everything
great well what we do now is created our
festival object and so that's going to
be the overall thing that we store our
data into but then on that object you
can create fields which are the
characteristics about that object that
we want to track so the object being
festival those characteristics you named
were nick start date and date kind of
thing exactly so in order to create
those we can do that by going to this
little tab on the right hand side this
little arrow guy
yeah it's our quick access menu to
toggle between the app and the
administrative setup so let's add some
fields</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
