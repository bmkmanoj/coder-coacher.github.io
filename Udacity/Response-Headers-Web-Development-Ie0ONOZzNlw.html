and just like the request the status
line is followed by a number of headers
I'll give you a few examples here are
some headers that are commonly included
of HTTP responses now just like the
client requests the headers that you see
aren't always the same some of them are
required and when I say required I mean
usually they're but the web has evolved
organically over time so many of the
headers that are you know required are
you know often not there or things will
work without them but anyway okay so
date is there all the time that's when
the request happened you know no
surprise there
server this is similar to the user agent
header on the request this is the
generally the name and version number of
the server that's handling the response
now personally I try to never include
this or if I do include it I make
something up because otherwise you're
just giving free information to a you
know a would be would be hacker who
wants to know what's vulnerabilities
work against you content type very
popular this is the type of document
that's being returned this is so your
browser knows how to display it so text
hTML is a common one obviously you know
that's what an HTML page would be you
could see image PNG or you know image
gif you know if it's an image that sort
of thing in content length is how long
the document that follows is contact
length is often included but it's not
strictly required because the browser
will know when the documents done
receiving data because the connection
may close there's other ways of also in
you know telling the browser that I'm
done sending data but it's not super
relevant right this second we've
discussed the basic requests and
responses let's let's play around on a
terminal a little bit and you know it
practice with these a bit okay so open
up a terminal if that is not
straightforward on your machine we'll
have some class notes on on how to do
that
you Windows users might have some
challenges in front of you so we're in
our terminal and we're going to use a
program called telnet to make some
internet requests to web servers and
watch the HTTP go by so we can see it in
practice okay so let's make a request
okay I'm making a request to Udacity
comm
80 this is the request your browser will
be making if you were loading Udacity
calm in it we connect the Vict comm 480
which if you recall 80 is the default
okay so I'll hit enter we connect and
now I'm going to send the request line
that we talked about before now I'm
going to send an HTTP 1.0 and I'll
explain why in a second and I'm going to
include the host header Google wants
this because as we discussed before it's
hosting a lot of different web servers
on that machine now let's scroll back up
to the top of this you can see the
request we made get slash HTTP 1.0 hosts
Udacity comm why did i do 1.0 because
the default behavior and 1.1 is to is
for the server to not close the
connection to allow the browser to make
multiple requests for multiple things
which is an optimization but when you're
testing by hand
it means the connection stays open and
then you have to close the connection on
your machine which is you know when
you're using telnet is sometimes a
little bit of a pain so we see our
response or our request 1.0 hosts
Udacity calm and then you see the
response from the server here's the
status line HTTP 1.0 200 ok so that
means it worked and now you can see a
bunch of headers some of these headers
we've we've seen and discussed before
here is date here is the server it's
Google front-end here's the content type
text HTML that means we're receiving
HTML which is no big surprise and if we
scroll down following the status line on
the headers we see the actual response
document and this is HTML this is thus
type of stuff we were working on before
this is complex but you get the idea
lots of HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
