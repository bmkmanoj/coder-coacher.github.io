be complete but it still has a bug if we
put in foo in bold in quotes as input
what who would expect is an output of
foo however what we get is a completely
different output what we get is an
output where the quotes are stripped but
the HTML tags are still there and
obviously the output does not match what
we actually expected we do have a bug in
here when I was a student I never got
any formal training in debugging I had
to figure out how to do the debugging
myself what I learned was how to use
debugging output that is I would go and
scatter output statements everywhere in
my program in Python this would be the
infamous
print statement so here again here is a
program and here's the one single input
that goes wrong if you press on run what
we get is the quotes removed but the
HTML markup is still there when I was a
student I never got any formal training
in debugging so had now to figure out
myself what went wrong the only thing I
knew was how to use debugging output so
I would use the print statement in
Python in order to figure out what had
gone wrong essentially I would go and
scatter print statements everywhere for
instance I can go and print all the
local variables in here cool so I know
what the character is and what the
status of tag and quote is know I click
on run oh yeah and here comes my big
output now I can scroll down here and
see oh yeah sure sure sure
obviously and of course now you can
immediately see what's going on in here
no I'm afraid I can't because this is
just a long long list think of a 1000
character input at this time if you have
a 1000 character input you have to go
through 3,000 lines of logs this may
help you but it's a total time waster
you have to enter these statements use
them for debugging and then remove them
again it is a total maintenance
nightmare</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
