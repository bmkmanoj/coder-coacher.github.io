the hits to analytics it might take a
while for the data to show up in the
analytics dashboard if like me you need
the instant gratification of seeing the
hits being sent you can check the logs
in Android studio so you're going to
need to enable verbose logging can do
that in the start tracking method in
your application subclass like this you
get the google analytics instance and
then you set the logger level and you
said it too verbose you're also going to
need to import the logger class so when
you've made these changes run the app
again make sure your phone is connected
to Android studio and run the app again
now down here in the logcat window make
sure you're showing the logcat window
set the logging level 2 verbose make
sure you have no filters and search a
sending hit if you have anything there
already go ahead and clear it all so
that you can start with a clean slate
this is what you're logging settings
will look like then grab your phone and
use the app and you should see the
logging entries showing up here each
time you go to a screen in your app
you'll get more entries showing up in
the logcat so eventually you're going to
get a bunch of different log entries for
each hit that gets sent so let's drill
down and look at one of the hits so a n
is the application name in my case
what's for dinner and CD it's a screen
name so i went to the show recipe screen
and I think the CD is for content
description but here it's the screen
name you are as the language us english
and t is the hit type which in this case
is a screen view and the tid this down
here is the analytics account ID this
gets taken directly from the config file
so if you've got the can ID wrong in the
config file its going to be sent wrong
in the hit there's no actual
verification done to make sure that this
is a correct value and down here a ID is
the package name so seeing these log
entries tells us hits
sent now we can go look for the data in
the analytics dashboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
