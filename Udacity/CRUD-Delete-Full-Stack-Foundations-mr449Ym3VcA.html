database is a good idea but sometimes we
make a few bad ideas that we may want to
delete later auntie anne's diner just
realized that their spinach ice cream
wasn't a hit and wants to remove it from
their menu deleting an item is a
three-step process similar to updating
first we want to execute the query to
find the spinach ice cream and store it
in a variable then we want to call
session delete on that item and finally
we'll commit the session let's go back
to the Python shell and walk through
this together let's assume auntie anne's
was the only restaurant with spinach ice
cream and use the dot one function to
grab this entry in the database to
double check i will print out the name
of the restaurant this menu item belongs
to and see that it is indeed auntie
anne's creation we will call session
delete to stage this item for removal
from the database and then call session
commit to persist this change if we
search for spinach now the SQL alchemy
gives us a no rule was found error
letting us know that this data is no
longer in our database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
