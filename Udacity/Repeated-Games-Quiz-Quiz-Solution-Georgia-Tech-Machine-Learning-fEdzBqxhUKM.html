answer right off the bat well one of
them is really easy to answer right off
the bat and that's - one - one good
because that's one of the points so so
the joint strategy to get the minus one
minus one would be for both players to
cooperate right again they're just you
know they're just willing to do that
just for the sake of showing that they
can make that value right and I think I
know the answers for the other ones as
well all right hit me so here's how I'm
gonna here's how I'm gonna talk you
through my reasoning so that at any
point I'm wrong you can gently steer me
away from embarrassing myself basically
I was looking at these points and I
thought huh they form a kind of convex
hull aha and I thought well surely
that's just an accident of the numbers
and then I thought oh wait of course
we're talking about averages here so
that means that all sort of
possibilities have to be inside the
convex hull of the outer points so if I
drew a line between those four points I
would end up with all possible
achievable averages well achievable
averages how how would you achieve
things inside the convex hull
I would appropriately average them so in
particular the first thing I noticed
that minus-30 is outside that so it
can't be it can't be something you can
achieve right there's no way to make
this minus-30 certainly not by choosing
any of these points but also no comment
no convex combination no probabilistic
combination of them is going to do that
either right oh this one is just right
out right so that leaves minus 4 minus 4
and it seems pretty that's inside the
convex hull so there is some combination
of them that would work that's right any
any sense of what it would be 2/3
I think 2/3 D D 1/3 C C and I get that
by noticing that D comma D is minus 6
minus 6 and C comma C is minus 1 minus 1
and 4 minus 4 is 2/3 of the way between
there boom
cool all right so you good with that I'm
good with that if you're good with that
it's your quiz no I'm I'm excited ok
yeah so those it's this this the minus
one minus one of the minus four minus
four are doing it and as you pointed out
there's a more
general result here having to do with
the convex hull right all right so
through the magic of computer graphics I
have a slightly better depiction of this
particular region now as you pointed out
this this convex hull of the points is
really important and what it represents
is the we can call it the feasible
region these are average payoffs of some
joint strategy they they may have to
collude to do this and they may not be
particularly easy to do but the fact the
matter is they can achieve by working
together payoffs anywhere inside this
region huh so that's what my student
Liam always meant when he talked about
feasible regions maybe so I mean it
could be the heat meant any of a number
of other things like places that he's
willing to live when he goes to gets a
job no it was all game theory stuff I
just never nobody was talking about but
now I do Michael thanks to you sure hey
I'm happy to help so this is a really
useful kind of geometric way of
picturing something that would otherwise
be a little bit harder to see I think in
the matrix for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
