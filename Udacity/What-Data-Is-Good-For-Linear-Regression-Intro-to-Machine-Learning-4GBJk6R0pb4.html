that you had to think about pretty hard
I would say there's only one answer this
one one data set it would be a good
candidate for linear regression
hopefully you got that one so what are
the problems with the other ones well
let's start with this one on the lower
right be pretty easy to think of a
function that might fit it nicely but
this function would be something like y
equals x squared which is not of the
form y equals MX plus B in other words
this isn't a line this is more of a
curve there are ways that you can fit
these functions but it wouldn't be an
example of linear regression so that's
why this would not be a good candidate
for linear regression one possibility
that's almost good for linear regression
is this one because you can fit it with
lines but you need two different lines
to fit the pattern adequately in fact if
you try to fit this whole data set with
one line it would probably give you
something like this a clever thing that
you could do would be to split it in
half along this dotted line and fit one
half of the data to one line and one
half to the other one so if you check
that box because you were thinking
something like that then I would say
that's probably an acceptable answer but
just as it is there's not a single line
that fits all of these data points so I
would say that without doing something
like fitting it piecewise this would not
be a good candidate either next let's do
the data set in the top middle here the
problem here is just that the data is
all over the place there doesn't seem to
be a very strong pattern so there's lots
of different lines that might all have
very similar R Squared's or sum of
squared errors that could all look very
different and in this case it's hard to
say that any of these lines is really
describing a pattern in the data very
well so I would say that this is not a
particularly good candidate and this
last one on the upper left is very
tricky and if you got this one wrong you
shouldn't feel too bad because it's
tough and the problem with this one is
let's look back at this equation y
equals MX plus B and what this means is
that by varying along the x axis the
input variable I want to be able to
predict something about what the Y value
will be along the vertical scale so only
have one x value and that's right here
have many different y-values all along
this range and so there's no way just
using this data that I can vary X and
use that to predict a change in y
another way to say this is that when the
equation tries to fit this data it's
going to come up with infinity for M and
usually when you get infinities it means
that something's going wrong this is
very tricky because you definitely need
to have variation in X now in this case
of course on the lower left
you only have variation in X you don't
have any variation in Y so in this case
the slope M would be equal to 0 so
fitting it with a line might be a little
bit of overkill you could just say that
suppose that this is 8 you could just
say that Y is always equal to 8 and that
would do a perfectly good job of
describing the pattern but it's very
important that you have a range of X
values that you can examine so that's
why this is not a good candidate for
linear regression
