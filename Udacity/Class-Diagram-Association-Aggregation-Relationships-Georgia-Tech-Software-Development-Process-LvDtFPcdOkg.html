going to look at is the association
relationship this is a relationship in
which objects of one class are connected
to objects of another and it's called an
has a relationship so it means that
objects of one class have objects of
another class so let's see what that
means let's do a by considering two
classes in our example system the
student class and the course offering
class in this case there is an
association between the student and the
course offering because the student is
registering for the course offering so
in a sense the course offering has
students contains students to indicate
this fact we add the solid line between
the student class and the course
offering and the fact of having a solid
line doesn't really tell us much about
the nature of the relationship so to
clarify such nature we can use what we
call adornments that we can apply to
associations we can add to associations
to clarify their meaning in particular
we can add a label to an association and
the label describes the nature of the
relationship in this case for example it
clarifies that the student registers for
course offering we can also add a
triangle to further clarify the
direction of the relationship so in this
case that the triangle will indicate
that is the student that registered for
the course offering and not the other
way around
another important adornment or a
notation that we can put on an
association is multiplicity multiplicity
defines the number of instances of one
class that are related to one instance
of the other class we can define
multiplicity as either and all the
relationship in this case for instance
we can say that if we look at the
student the student can register for two
or more course offerings
whereas if we look at the course
offering we can say that each course
offering can have or can enroll between
1 and 50 students so as you can see by
adding a label a direction and
multiplicity we make it much clearer
what the relationship is and what it
means and what are its characteristics
as we saw when we introduced
relationships there is a different kind
of Association have a specialized one
which we call aggregation so here we're
going to look at an example of an
aggregation so first of all what is an
aggregation an aggregation is a
relationship between two classes in
which one represents a larger class like
a whole which consists or smaller
classes which are the part of this whole
so let's look at an example in the Khan
texts of our system let's consider a
course and the course offering and in
this case we can see that the course
consists of multiple course offering so
in a sense a course is a whole and the
course offerings are the part of this
whole so this is a perfect case in which
we will use an aggregation to express
this relationship so we will add a solid
line with a diamond on the side of the
whole class to indicate that the course
consists of multiple course offerings
and as we did for associations even
though we are not going to do it for
this specific example we could also in
this case add multiplicity information
on the aggregation to indicate how many
classes of the two types are involved in
the relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
