browser and we had a couple of
annoyances and they were can't share the
success link and we can't reload the
page without an annoying message the way
we work around this issue is by using a
redirect instead of rendering the result
in the post we send them to another page
that says thanks so remember I drew this
picture before of you and the server's
making requests or your browser we made
that first request the get request for
the form and then the server responded
with the form HTML you posted your your
answer and then if you submitted
something correct the browser responded
with the success message now this seems
simple and nice but as we said if you
respond to a post with content you've
got these two major limitations the link
doesn't share well and you can't reload
the page now imagine we weren't doing a
contrived example like a like entering
dates into text boxes and instead we
were you know adding a new blog post to
our blog we'd want to be able to see our
blog post once we submit it but we don't
want to every time you know we want to
build a link to that blog post and we
want to be able to you know reload that
page without editing our blog post every
time you post something to the server
the service got to do some work we don't
want to have to server to have to do
that work of validating our date you
know every time over and over just when
we want to see our success message so
instead of returning the success HTML we
return a redirect and this will tell the
we'll send a redirect to go to a
different URL our success page to which
the server will respond with our success
HTML now you may think well the old way
had you know only two round-trips you
know get post' answer and the new way
has a get a post and get the success
page so that's three round-trips
but if we can avoid both of these issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
