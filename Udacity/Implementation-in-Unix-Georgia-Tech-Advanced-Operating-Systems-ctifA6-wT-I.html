implementation now this is where rubber
meets the road in systems research in
any good systems research the
prescription is as follows you identify
a pain point once you identify the pain
point you think of what may be a clever
solution to that then a lot of heavy
lifting actually happens in taking that
solution which may be a very simple
solution but implementing that is the
hard part if you take this particular
lesson that we are looking at the
solution idea is fairly simple the idea
is that instead of using the disk as a
paging device use a cluster memory but
implementing that idea requires quite a
bit of heavy lifting and one might say
that in systems research these technical
details of taking an idea and working
out the technical details of
implementing that idea is probably the
most important nugget even if the idea
itself is not in during the
implementation tricks and techniques
that are invented in order to do that
implementation of that idea may be
reusable knowledge for other systems
research so that's a key takeaway in any
systems research and it is true for this
one as well now in this particular case
the authors of GSM used a deck digital
equipment corporations operating system
as the base system the operating system
is called OSF one operating system and
there are two key components in the OSF
one memory system which is what we're
talking about here the first one is the
virtual memory system and this is the
one that is responsible for mapping
process virtual address space to
physical memory and worrying about page
faults that happen when a process is
trying to access its stack and heap and
so on so that it can bring those missing
pages perhaps from the disk and these
pages are sometimes referred to as
anonymous pages because a page is host
in a physical page frame and when a page
is replay
that same physical page frame may host
some other virtual page and so on so the
virtual memory system is devoted to
managing the page faults that occur for
process virtual address space in
particular the stack in the heap and the
unified buffer cache is the cache that
is used by the filesystem and remember
that file system is also getting stuff
from the disk but the file system wants
to cash it in physical memory so that it
is faster so the unified buffer cache is
serving as the abstraction for the disk
resident files when it gets into
physical memory and user processes are
going to do explicit access to files
when they do that they are actually
accessing the unified buffer cache so
reads and writes of files go to this
unified buffer cache in addition to that
unique systems offer the ability to map
a file into memory which is called
memory mapped files and if you have a
memory mapped file you can also have
page faults to a file that has been
mapped into memory so the unified buffer
cache is responsible for handling page
faults to mapped files as well as
explicit read and write calls that an
application process may make to the file
system so normally this is the picture
of how the memory system hangs together
in any typical implementation of an
operating system you have the virtual
memory manager is a unified buffer cache
you have the disk and reads and writes
from the virtual memory manager go to
the disk and similarly reads and writes
from the unified buffer cache go to the
desk and when a physical page frame is
freed you throw it into the free list so
that it is available for future used by
either the virtual memory manager or the
unified buffer cache and the page or
demon its role is to look at every once
in a while what are pages that can be
swapped out to the disk so that you make
room for page faults to be handled
without necessarily running an algorithm
to free up pages so that's the structure
of a memory management system and what
the authors of GMS did was to integrate
GMS into the
operating system and this is where I
said that there is heavy lifting to be
done because you are modifying the
operating system to integrate an idea
that you had for global memory system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
