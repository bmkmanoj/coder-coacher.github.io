perform both operations simultaneously
for example one might want to forward
traffic but also count how much traffic
is being forwarded both of those
operations can be performed in parallel
another way of composing policies is in
sequence sequential composition performs
one operation than the next for example
we might want to implement a firewall
and whatever traffic makes it through
the firewall might then be subjected to
the switching policy one example of
sequential composition might be a load
balancer in this example a policy might
take some traffic coming from half of
the source IP addresses and rewrite that
to one server replica and take the other
half of the traffic and rewrite it to
the other replicas after the load
balancer rewrites the destination IP
address we need a routing module to
forward the traffic out the appropriate
port on the switch in this case we've
used sequential composition to first
apply a load balance policy that
rewrites the destination IP address
based on the source IP address where the
traffic is coming from and sequentially
apply a routing policy that forwards the
traffic out the appropriate port
depending on the resulting destination
IP address after that rewrite has taken
place notice that we can use predicates
to specify which traffic traverses which
modules those predicates can apply
specific actions based on things like
the input port and the packet header
fields the ability to compose policies
in this fashion allows each module to
partially specify functionality without
having to write the policy for the
entire network this leaves some
flexibility so that one module can
implement a small bit of the network
function leaving some functions for
other modules this also allows for
module reuse since a module need not be
tied to a particular network setting for
example in this particular example where
we've applied a load balancer followed
by routing
the load balancer spreads traffic across
the replicas without regard to the
underlying network paths that traffic
takes once those destination IP
addresses are rewritten in summary we've
covered two concepts one is the notion
of a northbound API which sits on top of
an SDN controller and provides and
exposes higher level abstractions that
allows the operator or programmer to
write policies without regard to how
open flow rules eventually get installed
we've also talked about two different
composition operators parallel
composition and sequential composition
which specify how individual simpler
policies can be composed to implement
more complex Network applications thus
allowing different Sdn control programs
to independently perform tasks on the
same traffic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
