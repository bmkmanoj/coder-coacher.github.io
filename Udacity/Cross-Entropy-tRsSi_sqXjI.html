most problems until you get into
situations where you have tens of
thousands or even millions of classes in
that case your vector becomes really
really large and as mostly zeros
everywhere and that becomes very
inefficient you'll see later how we can
deal with these problems using
embeddings what's nice about this
approach is that we can now measure how
well we're doing by simply comparing two
vectors one that comes out of your
classifiers and contains the
probabilities of your classes and the
one hot encoded vector that corresponds
to your labels let's see how we can do
this in practice the natural way to
measure the distance between those two
probability vectors is called the cross
entropy I'll denote it by D here for
distance in math it looks like this be
careful the cross entropy is not
symmetric and you have a nasty log in
there so you have to make sure that your
labels and your distributions are in the
right place your labels because they're
one hot encoded will have a lot of
zeroes in them and you don't want to
take the log of zeroes for your
distribution the softmax will always
guarantee that you have a little bit of
probability going everywhere so you
never really take a log of zero so let's
recap because we have a lot of pieces
already so we have an input it's going
to be turned into logits using a linear
model which is basically a matrix
multiply and a bias we're then going to
feed the logits which are scores into a
softmax to turn them into probabilities
and then we're going to compare those
probabilities to the one hot encoded
labels using the cross entropy function
this entire setting is often called
multinomial logistic classification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
