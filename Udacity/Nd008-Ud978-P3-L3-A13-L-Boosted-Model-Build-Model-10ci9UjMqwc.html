trying to predict what mode of
transportation did employees take to
work who did not respond to the survey
in all tracks we are now going to use a
boosted model to try to predict this
outcome and then determine how well it
fared as a model so we've already built
out the input data and to create samples
tool so what I'm going to do now is
leverage the busa model tool to build
out this model the first thing I'm going
to do is name the model and it's going
to be called boosted underscore
transportation I'm now going to select
my target field which is going to be the
mode of transportation I'm now going to
select my different predictor variables
such as gender age marital status and
the drive distance in miles I'm now
going to jump over to the model
customization option and what I'm going
to do is I'm going to select a target
type and the loss function distribution
and really what this is just going to
tell the model is what type of data is
the target variable and what I'm going
to choose is this data is multinomial
meaning there's three or more different
outcomes and it's a categorical variable
so this option we have three different
types of categories of mode of
transportation people take to work so
multinomial makes the most sense the
last few configuration options are more
advanced techniques for the purposes of
this course we're going to keep these
options at default values you can read
more about them in the reading notes
section I'm now going to run this model
and we can examine it next in the Browse
tool after we learn about what we are
looking for in the results first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
