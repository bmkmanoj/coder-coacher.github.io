validate the users input let's talk
about how they're going to fit into
things so we have you and we have our
servers and you make a request for the
form and this is a get request and the
server responds with the form data and
then you make a post request to the
server with the data in this case you
know it'll be a month day and year now
the server is going to run our
validation functions and it's going to
do one of two things if the data is good
the server will say thanks but if the
data is bad the server is going to
respond with the form data again and the
server will also include an error
message telling user to re-enter there
to reenter their values and they'll have
the form handy so they can do that
easily and then we'll go up to this
phase again okay so let's talk about our
approach to doing this we're going to
have to do three things first we're
going to have to verify the user's input
next we're going to have to detect if
it's an error and render the form again
maybe and when we're rendering that form
we're going to need to include an error
message because if we don't include that
error message the user is just going to
hit submit on our form and see the form
again and they will be confused forever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
