points data point one
well it's observe value was two point
zero zero and the mean was two point
zero zero so it's actually a distance of
zero from the mean the absolute
deviation of this number this
observation was zero what about this guy
one point two meters
well one point two minus two is equal to
zero point eight negative zero point
eight but since I don't really care
whether they're overestimating or
underestimating
I'm gonna always make these numbers
positive which I do by taking the
absolute value so let's just call that
positive zero point eight so this third
measurement of two point eight I get
again a deviation of zero point eight
now for my three measurements
I have deviations of 0.8 and pointing
that's the deviation part what about the
average well we know how to do an
average we take the sum zero plus point
eight plus point eight gives me one
point six and we divide by the number of
data points so one point six divided by
three is equal to about zero point five
three so the average deviation for this
first doctor was zero point five three
and that unit there is meters we can
interpret this by saying when this
doctor makes a measurement
I can only say with confidence that
she's probably within 0.53 meters though
even then that's not always true in fact
in two of these measurements she was
outside of that range the way we would
write this is by saying the green-haired
doctor measured my height to be two
point zero zero meters plus or minus
zero point five three meters now knowing
my height to within half a meter is not
so helpful so let's see what the purple
haired doctor said can you tell me how
the purple haired doctor would state my
height including the average and the
average deviation and your answer here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
