in 60 dad's end up raising a child that
doesn't belong to him so non paternity
is obviously an issue at fairly high
prevalence in the United States and
general possibly the world in general
how does 23 me deal with issues of not
paternity so this is certainly a big
issue for 23 Emmy because it's one of
the most high impact results that
someone who signs up from 24 23 me can
get and before people sign up it's very
important that they consider the
possibility of making a discovery about
biological relationships in their family
that they didn't previously know about
and so and that's why when we launched
the service from the very beginning we
in our Terms of Service we said and be
you should be aware that you may learn
things about yourself that you find
uncomfortable that are disturbing
including that your biological father is
not your biological further the person
you know to be your father is not your
biological father so we were very
explicit from the very beginning that
this is the possibility and so that the
people are aware that that is something
that can come out of DNA analyses and so
our people do you find many people not
aware that the personal genetic services
offered at 23 I mean is essentially in a
way can be like a paternity test well um
many organizations that do official
paternity testing are doing it in a way
that it the evidence will hold up in a
court so it's a bit a bit of a different
process so for 23 Emmy customers it's
more like something they just discover
but when they're exploring their data
and the main way that people discover
normal ternity is if they find that
their genetic relationship to another
family memories don't what they
anticipated that that they are instead
of being a full sibling with someone I
think there's there something there a
half-sibling because they have different
fathers so that's not an unusual
and one a resource that we provide is we
provide a forearm a discussion forum
where many of our customers put out
their questions to other members of the
23 me community and that's where we've
seen evidence of people discovering
opportunity and very often they have
questions like how do i check without
what to find out whether this is the
true or not how do I handle
conversations with other members of my
family and other members of the 23 my
community often come forward with advice
on you know who else should be tested in
the family how do you know approach um
yeah other family members and I've seen
people reporting cases where they said
I'm not going to tell my dad that I've
discovered this because he's been my dad
all my life and um and there's no need
for us to change that sure about him and
so people make these big personal
decisions once they get this this
