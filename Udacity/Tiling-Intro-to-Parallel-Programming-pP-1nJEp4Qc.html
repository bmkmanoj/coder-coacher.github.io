coalesced reeds but scattered writes and
our goal is to achieve coalesced reeds
and coalesced writes clearly swapping
the order of the reads and writes
wouldn't help because then we'd simply
have scattered reeds and coalesced
writes so how do we achieve both of
these the solution is going to be a
really important general strategy so
I'll spend a little time on it the idea
is that we're going to take a tile of
the input matrix at a time and we're
going to transpose it and copy it into
its transposed location in the output
matrix and this is going to be the job
of a single thread block so the threads
in this thread block are going to work
cooperatively together to perform this
copy and transpose of a tile of elements
at a time the threads in the thread
block are going to copy the tile into
shared memory the shared memory
belonging to that thread block they're
going to perform the transpose so now
the transpose of these elements the
elements in this tile is happening in
shared memory where you don't pay that
tremendous cost that you see in global
memory to do a scattered write in or a
read and finally the threads in the
thread block will work together to copy
the elements out and the key is this if
our tile is large enough say it's a K by
K tile say the K is 32 in that case each
warp will copy out a chunk of 32
elements at a time into shared memory
and because all 32 threads in that warp
are reading and writing adjacent
locations in memory you'll get good
coalescing and then when you copy the
transposed matrix to its new location in
global memory you can once again do it
in a coalesced fashion so let's try this
as a programming exercise we'll give you
the start of a tiled transpose kernel
and the code that calls it and you
should modify the kernel code to declare
an array in shared memory and copy
appropriate elements in and out of the
shared memory is that the final elements
are written out in transposed fashion
now don't forget to add any sync threads
barriers that you need to make sure that
you get the correct result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
