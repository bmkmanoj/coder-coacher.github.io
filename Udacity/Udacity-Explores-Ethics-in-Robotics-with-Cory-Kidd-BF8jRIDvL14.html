performing more or less ethically so the
space that you're in so I know there's
issues when you're dealing with health
care when you're tracking people's
health so I think there's two things
that we think about here so so one is
we're building a new application for a
group of patients and we think of as an
application for us is really the
intersection of you know some disease
day some condition in some treatment
right so we're helping patients with a
certain type of cancer take this oral
drug every day for example right what do
we want to be doing to benefit those
patients right so part of that for us is
let's look into the challenge in science
for patients today what are the
challenges that they have successfully
staying on therapy how do we go about
solving them and again the technology
event is a piece that lets us do this
not for one patient but for thousands
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
of patients okay and so that's really
kind of a guiding principle here what
are we doing to help this patient
population better manage their own
therapy and get information back to
their care team so that those people can
help manage that group of patients so
that's that's one set of things and
that's really the thing that drives how
we design everything that we do the
other then is on the regulatory side
right if we look at where we fit in
terms of the healthcare industry there
are certain things that we can and can't
do in terms of what type of a device to
do and the good thing about that is that
you know a very well-developed appeal
right you know again city called FDA
right and there's a lot of guidance from
FDA that is not necessarily about
robotics okay I can actually guarantee
you that none of it is about robotics
but it's still very applicable right in
terms of what we're actually doing with
our patients the challenges and the
problems that we're trying to solve for
them all of this guidance and you know
the laws and the rules are very
applicable to what we're doing so we can
use that also as a reference for the
types of things we can and should and
cannot should not be with patients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
