that basically even the ideal processor
that can execute any number of
instructions per cycle still has to obey
raw dependencies meaning it still has to
wait for results to be produced before
they can be used by instructions that
need those results and that really
creates some of the delays that the
ideal processor is going to have and
that's why the ILP is not zero it's
going to be something larger than zero
even for an ideal processor so let us
now look at some instructions so let's
say that I one is producing a value that
is used by I 2 and then I 3 is producing
a value for I 4 and then I 4 produces a
value that is used for I 5 so what is
going to be the CPI for this particular
program well it's gonna be CPI is equal
how many cycles do we need for this 3
for these five instructions well here's
what's gonna happen
I 1 can execute immediately in the first
cycle and so can i 3 because it doesn't
have to wait for anything so we spent
one cycle executing i1 and i3 the next
cycle I took and now go and i-4 can also
go cause I 3 is now done and then we
still need a third cycle to execute i-5
which has to wait for i-4 so we have
spent three cycles for five instructions
which is going to be a CPI of 0.6 so the
CPI is still lower than 1 but now it's
even larger and finally if we did have
this dependence as well now we have to
do I 1 and then I 2 and then i 3 and
then I 4 and then I 5 so now the CPI
with this is gonna be one why well
because we need 5 cycles to execute 5
instructions so the CPI is gonna be 1 so
basically in the program the dependence
is the raw dependencies are gonna
determine basically what is the possible
CPI even if the processor can do
everything else ideally meaning it can
fetch any number of instructions it can
decode and read registers in any number
of instructions but it simply cannot
provide time travel which which we which
is kind of the only consideration that
we really consider in this case it's
just that you know we cannot do time
travel everything else we
do we still have a CPI that is somewhere
between one and zero you would have a CP
of zero if you have a very large number
of instructions with no dependencies we
have seen that we have a CPI of one if
you have any number of instructions that
are all dependent on the previous
instructions you really cannot do
anything in parallel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
