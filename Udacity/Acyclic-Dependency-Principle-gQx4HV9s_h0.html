states that the dependencies between
packages must not form cycles expressed
in terms of DSM s this says that you
should be able to permute the rows and
columns of the DSM in such a way that
the transitive closure of the matrix is
lower triangular what this means is that
there is a strict ordering among the
components such that a component only
depends on other components beneath it
and never on one above it a violation of
this property is seen in a system where
component a depends upon component B and
component B depends directly or
indirectly on component a not only is it
difficult to maintain such systems it is
even hard to understand them in other
words you can't understand a without
understanding B and you can't understand
B without understanding a there are
several ways to deal with violations of
the a cyclic dependency principle if you
have a situation where a depends on B
and B to pendulum a you can invent a
module C take the part of a that B
depends on and place it in C and have
both a and B depend upon C another way
to break the cycle where the packages
are siblings is to add an interface
class into B and have a implement it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
