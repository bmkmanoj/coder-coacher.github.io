Hippocrates I'm a natural philosopher
from over 2400 years ago and I've
studied the mechanisms of inheritance
okay well lay it on us it's called
blended inheritance
what's blended inheritance blended
inheritance is the idea that one
particular trait in an offspring came
from one of the parents directly or is a
mix of the parents traits but how do you
think that works exactly I'm not exactly
sure but I've seen this fluid that comes
from the male reproductive organ and I
think females probably have something
similar my theory is that it's a mix
based on the battle fluids between the
male and female hmm well I'm pretty sure
you're right about the male reproductive
fluid but I think you're a little behind
the times on the female fluid my theory
is that these fluids are actually an
amalgamation of fluids from throughout
the whole body each responsible for
forming that particular part the fluid
from the toes is responsible for forming
the toes and the fluid from the eyes is
responsible for forming more eyes and so
on at conception a battle of fluid takes
place and a child resemble aspects of
whichever fluid wins that battle one or
the other parents or mix it both okay I
mean even though we know a lot more
about how reproduction works now your
idea of blended inheritance does sound
kind of reasonable but I can think of an
example that breaks the rule of
inheritance which of the following
scenarios do you think shows that
Hippocrates blending model doesn't
explain every tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
