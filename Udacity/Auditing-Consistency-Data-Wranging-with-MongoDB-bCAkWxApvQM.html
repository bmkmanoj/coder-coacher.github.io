entries contradict one another so for
example if a customer is recorded in two
different systems as having two
different current addresses we've got a
consistency problem fixing consistency
problems really boils down to the
problem of who do I trust the most
or more specifically which data source
do I trust the most so with our address
example we might ask ourselves which
entry was collected most recently or if
our problem is one that's a little more
general say just location information
another type of question we can ask is
which collection method is likely to be
most reliable because one data source
might be populated based on GPS while
another is based on user entered data we
might actually have a third that's using
IP based location detection and all
three of these are contributing location
information to our system so again
addressing consistency problems is about
determining which of our data sources is
most likely to be correct and possibly
introducing agreement among our
inconsistent records by copying the data
from the record we trust the most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
