user named root and that user is super
powerful they can do anything they want
on this machine it's very common to
disable the ability to remotely log in
as root instead will log in as a user we
create and then we can run individual
commands as root by using another
command this is to make any potential
attackers job a little more difficult by
eliminating the username that they
already know exists on this box our
vagrant virtual machine has already set
up the security pattern for us and many
other cloud providers will do this for
you as well if not it's highly advised
that this be one of the very first
things you do when you're setting up a
new server and we'll cover exactly how
to do that a bit later so let's run that
same command again except this time
we'll prepend the command with this sudo
command here now we see the results the
sudo command ran this command as if we
were root</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
