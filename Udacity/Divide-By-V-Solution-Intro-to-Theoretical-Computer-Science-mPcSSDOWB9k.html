course is a little more subtle so
there's two reasons why that doesn't
work the first reason is a very
formalistic one the RAM can only handle
integers or at least the RAM cannot
handle numbers with an arbitrary
precision because having an arbitrary
precision is exactly the same thing as
having an infinite amount of values
available for each variable and we said
that the RAM doesn't support that and
actually your computer also doesn't go
to support that so you might be working
with numbers such as one point two three
four five or so but these numbers are
always rounded numbers so also your
computer does not have arbitrary
precision it's pretty well thought out
normally how your computer handle such
numbers which is why we normally don't
notice but in general there's no
arbitrary precision for your computer
also secondly the table size wouldn't
change so we are not allowed to do this
but let's say we were allowed to do this
and then represent all of the values in
the table exactly then the table size
itself wouldn't change because you start
out with a table that has 1 2 3 4 and so
on until you get to V columns and now in
your new table you would just have the
same amount of columns only the comms
will be labeled 1 over V 2 / v 3 / v 4 /
v until you get to one the third and
fourth are not valid reasons adjust
because then p would be NP is no counter
argument against this and of course as
I've just shown you that is also not
true but asking this question here leads
us to something else what if we were to
divide all values by some number which
I'm going to specify to you and then
round it down by rounding we do two
things so by rounding we would make
numbers that the RAM can handle and also
in the case of rounding the table size
would change so let's say you had a
table that looked like point 5 1 1.5 to
2.5 3 and so on then you could always
put two columns together so these two
except for the first one that would
become 0 but all the others you can put
together so those two would become a
column one those two would become a
column two if you have 3.5 here then you
would have a con 3 and so on so you
would be able to scale down the table
but of Cour
the whole thing comes at a price because
scaling down the table means that you
put two columns together only taking the
minimum of it and therefore possibly
arrive at a suboptimal solution because
certain objects where one object has a
slightly higher value than another one
become indistinguishable using this
technique well we're not going to / v
we're going to divide by some factor
dividing all values by a certain factor
is a good idea but we have to round and
this gives us an error now if you take a
close look at this you can almost see
the approximation algorithm emerging
here because what happens when this
factor here becomes very large well then
we scale down the table that we build a
lot so we're here we have n here we have
V if we divide all values by some large
factor and of course we have to round
then this table here becomes very small
but of course our error also increases
and if this factor here is very small
which means we almost keep all of the
original table well then our running
time is still very large but the error
that we make is potentially smaller so
this is exactly where the time and
quality trade-off will come from let's
now have a look at that in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
