for tablets that are less than optimal
and see where they break down we'll use
the factors we discussed as a rubric for
grading each you I this first example
shows a list of messages or updates
perhaps it's some kind of social app
it's essentially a list with full width
text and images let's see how it goes
against our rubric for what we're
optimizing for now firstly I don't think
this design offers a balanced use of
space the left alignment can leave lots
of empty space and it feels a bit
lopsided secondly anytime you have full
width text this isn't optimizing for
reading comfort as you're likely to
exceed the 45 to 75 carets a line
lengths we want lastly I'd say that this
design risks blowing images up to fill
this width sacrificing quality this next
example is something like a detail
screen with a full width image with an
awkward aspect ratio looks like it might
have a fixed height but Phil width of
the screen then it has some text content
top left aligned looking at our
optimization goals art say that this
design isn't very balanced all of the
content is concentrated here on the top
left this design also doesn't seem to
respect image quality displaying a small
sliver like this is likely to only
convey a portion of the whole image
lastly I'd say that there might be a
missed opportunity to maintain context
this looks like a sparse detail screen
it might have made more sense to show
this info in a larger context a in its
own panel or dialogue our last example
tablet screen shows some kind of image
feed here the images flow horizontally
from left to right again looking at our
rubric I'd say that this design doesn't
make balanced use of space we have dense
content here on the left and sparse
areas here on the right this design also
doesn't optimize for image quality it's
not that the layout is likely to blow up
images it's more of a missed opportunity
to display them more richly or
interestingly this design appears to use
a fixed size for each image which is a
shame why not make better use of the
space
lastly I've marked it down for overall
aesthetic I'd say that this kind of
jagged look like this is somewhat
awkward while these examples might seem
contrived their representative of how
many apps out there today aren't
thinking adaptively with some simple
tweaks you can vastly improve how your
app might appear on larger devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
