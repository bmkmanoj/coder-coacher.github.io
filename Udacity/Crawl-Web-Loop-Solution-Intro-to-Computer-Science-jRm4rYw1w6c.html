pop pops the only thing we've seen that
actually removes elements from a list
and that also has the property that it
returns that element if we do to crawl
pop that'll get us the last element in
the to crawl list remove that element
from the list to crawl and assign that
to the variable page one important point
to note is because we're getting the
last element first what we're
implementing is what's called a
depth-first search and that means that
as we crawl web pages if we had three
links on the first page well what's
gonna happen is we're gonna follow that
last link we're gonna add two links that
we find there to the page before getting
to these links well we're gonna follow
this link right that's gonna be the last
link that we added we're gonna follow
that we're gonna get to that page and
we're gonna follow the last link on that
page so this is why it's a depth-first
search
we don't get to look at the second link
on the first page until we've followed
all the links that we can reach from the
last link on the first page if our goal
was to get a good corpus of the web
quickly doing a depth-first search would
probably not be the best way to do that
and some of the questions at the end of
your homework asked you to figure out
ways to change the search order that
will give us a better way of capturing
content on the web for now we're going
to be happy and with the test site it's
enough to do a depth-first search
if we can complete our search no matter
what order we follow we'll always find
the same set of pages if we aren't able
to complete the search and with a real
web crawler there's far too many pages
to wait until we find them all to return
a result then the order that we do the
pages matters a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
