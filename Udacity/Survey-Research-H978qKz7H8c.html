in making a change in the world and then
measuring the effect that that change
had for example we might want to give
students a tool that we believe will
help them learn and then measure how
well that will actually help them learn
but sometimes we're not ready to
actually make a change in the world yet
sometimes we just want to understand the
world a little bit better or we just
want to understand the nature of reality
and that can then inform some tools we
design later on Survey Research is one
way of doing this in Survey Research
we're not actually making a changed or
participants we're just asking them to
report on their opinions their
perspectives their experiences and using
the results of those surveys we then
construct an understanding of whatever
population we're investigating surg
research can be very complicated though
it's very difficult to design a good
survey it's difficult to know how to
draw a representative sample out of a
population of people you might not even
know what those words mean yet so in
this lesson we're going to talk about
these things we'll talk about designing
good surveys and making sure the results
you get from the surveys are actually
valid and generalizable to that
population</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
