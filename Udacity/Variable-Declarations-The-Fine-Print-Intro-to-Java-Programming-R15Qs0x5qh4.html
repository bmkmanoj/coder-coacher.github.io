variable declaration says var x equals
13 well var isn't a type that we've seen
yet so it looks like the answer is d the
variable has a bad type let's look at
the next one
int x equals in quotation marks 13 well
it usually takes a number and 13 is
actually a string so it looks like these
don't match so the answer is C the
variable type doesn't match the initial
value type the next one double x equals
13 point 0 well we're missing the
semicolon that was an option
looks like f int lucky number equals 13
that one's a little bit trickier but it
looks like there's a space in what we
meant to be our variable name lucky
number we can't have spaces and variable
names they can only contain letters and
numbers so that would be a x equals 13
well we don't know if this is right or
not because we don't know if X is
actually in it the answer is G variable
declarations must have types int X we
haven't given any initial value it's
always a good idea to include an initial
value into the lucky number equals 13
this one looks good to me so there's no
mistake</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
