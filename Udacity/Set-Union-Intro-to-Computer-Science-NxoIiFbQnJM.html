use them to solve problems like this we
didn't know more about what to search
for so we'll try searching for Union and
well we get a lot of stuff that's not
very useful we can see that the
Philadelphia Union lost its last game we
can learn about credit unions and union
college that's not going to work very
well we could try the same search on a
different search engine like go and it's
a little more helpful maybe it does give
us computer science as one of the
choices for unions but what it gives us
under that is not too helpful for what
we're looking for we could also try my
personal favorite search engine search
with peter dot info and if we search
there let's see what we find world
domination plans uh and then we find the
discussions on the Udacity forum about
this very question this is kind of a
unusual result and probably not what we
should normally be doing what we really
should be doing is thinking of better
things to search for so instead of
searching for union let's add Python to
our search so we'll search for Python in
Union and now we start already to get
very interesting results we didn't need
to think too hard about what to search
for searching for python and the thing
we want to do on Python actually turns
out quite a lot of useful information
and we can see the second hit here is
actually doing exactly what we want or
something very close to it how to find
the intersection and union of two lists
and Python and if we click on that we
can see some code and it actually has
code for doing Union so one thing we
might do would just be to copy that code
and I'm going to discourage you from
doing that but let's try that first we
found this code and this doesn't do
quite what we wanted in the question but
what I'm going to ask you to do for the
quiz is to take this code and turn it
into something that does what you want
so let's assume that you did this you
search for how to Union to list in
Python and you came up with this code
and let's assume that if you have only
taken cs101 well there are lots of
things in here that might be a little
strange to you having this string here
we haven't used docstrings in cs101 so
that looks a little strange we haven't
seen sets
and we've seen list but we haven't seen
anything quite like this so there's a
lot of mysterious stuff in this code but
let's assume it does what it says it
does and your question is could you use
this to solve the original problem so
your goal is to implement a union
function that behaves as specified in
the original question which is that
modifies the first input to become the
Union so after calling Union passing in
a and B instead of getting a result
which is the union of the two lists as
this code does what you want to do is
modify the value of a to contain the
union of a and B and I should add a note
here that this is a pretty silly thing
to do but see if you can do it anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
