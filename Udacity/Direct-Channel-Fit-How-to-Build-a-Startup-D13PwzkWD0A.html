economics in other words how are we
gonna make money so let's take a look at
a direct sales example you have a sales
force and you're selling directly to the
end consumer so let's assume that the
lowest price of your product is $100 so
one of the first questions and thinking
about how to come up with this hundred
our list price is to understand how much
did it actually cost me to manufacture a
product now in the web it might be the
cost of my engineers but in a physical
product it might be the costed bill of
materials not coming out of my factory
and so let's assume for the sake of
discussion that that was $33 $33 to
build my product next let's take a look
at the cost of my R&amp;amp;D that is my
engineering the cost of my direct sales
people may be commissions or direct
sales compensation and then general and
administration cost what it cost me to
have leases and lunches and free snacks
and that might be another $20 and so
right now it's 53 dollars just to keep
the lights on in my building now
something we should consider is that no
end user pays list price so let's assume
that this area represents a discount
from the list price let's say 10% that
means your revenue to your company would
not be $100 but $90 so wait a minute
you're getting $90 but you spent a total
of 53 dollars building the product then
keeping the lights on and that leaves
right in the middle how much profit you
have in this case would be $37 so your
selling costs were embedded here this
was the Commission or direct sales cost
or whatever you were paying your direct
sales people and you made $37 selling
directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
