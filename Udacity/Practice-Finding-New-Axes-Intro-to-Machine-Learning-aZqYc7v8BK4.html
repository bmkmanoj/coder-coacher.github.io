if we go down with you and there's
access one down on the right direction
then we go to to the right and kind of a
fallen alley as we go one to the right
here we go two up so that Evalia is also
too it turns out these two vectors again
our earth organelle if you understood
where the dot product is and it did they
build they would offer all these two
vectors you will get 0 which is a
measure of orthogonal T but that's not
really that important what's important
is that we found out where the center of
the data is and we found the principal
axis of variation the only last thing I
didn't tell you about the only last
thing is that PCA also returns an
importance value a spread value for
these axes and that spreader value tends
to be very large for the very first
accessor variation a much smaller for
the second axis of variation if the
spread is small so this number is
happens to be an eigenvalue that comes
out of an eigenvalue decomposition
that's really implemented by PCA but
what it really gives you is an
importance vector how important to take
each axis when you look at the data so
when you run the code you'll find you
the new origin you find these different
vectors and you'll find an importance
value is given to these vectors they
really matters the amount of spread so
let me do a little quiz here to see if
we are at odds with each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
