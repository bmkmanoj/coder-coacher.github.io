downstream so we know what this
corresponding time must be six we know
the speed of the boat going down stream
is faster with the current so we'll have
the speed of the boat which is X and
then we'll add the current which is 12
the return trip for the boat is going to
be eight hours so for upstream are going
against the current will have eight for
the time the speed of the boat against
the current would be X minus 12 we'll
have the speed of the boat which is X
and then we have to subtract off the
current speed which is 12 and here's
what's different about this problem we
don't know the distances going upstream
or downstream will need expressions for
each of these the distance is equal to
rate times time so when going upstream
the boat's distance would be X minus 12
the rate times 8 the time and when going
downstream will have the rate X plus 12
times the time which is six this is our
complete table with all the information
we need and if we want we can go ahead
and simplify each of these expressions
when we distribute the eighth will have
8x minus ninety six for the first one
I'm going to distribute the 6 will have
6x plus 72 here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
