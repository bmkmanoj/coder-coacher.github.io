know that four eighths would be equal to
one-half more importantly we know that
this step cannot be correct the student
tried to simplify terms in the numerator
and in the denominator remember terms
are separated by addition or subtraction
we cannot cancel terms but we can cancel
factors factors are numbers or variables
that are multiplied in the numerator
denominator for example if we started
with six twelves we could rewrite the
six as 2 times 3 and 12 s 2 times 6 we
can simplify the factors of 2 since
these cancel out to equal one this would
leave us with 36 we repeat this process
one more time by rewriting three and six
with factors we can cancel the 3s since
they make an equivalence of one this
leaves us with one half so whenever
we're working throughout this unit keep
in mind that we can't cancel terms we
can only cancel factors things that are
multiplied in the numerator and in the
denominator and finally we know
five-eighths cannot be simplified since
five and eight do not share common
factor so we also need to include this
