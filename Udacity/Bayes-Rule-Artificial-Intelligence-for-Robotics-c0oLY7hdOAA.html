rule say you own a house and you know
that the house might catch fire in your
absence but the probability of it
catching fire is F over here is small
it's a tenth of a percent 0.01 let's say
every afternoon you talk to your
neighbor and every afternoon you ask a
neighbor does my house burn of course
you live with paranoid if you do this
but for the sake of the argument let's
just assume it with this F the afternoon
and this afternoon he comes back and
says yes it burns so be you happen to
know that the neighbor is not very
truthful in fact every time we ask him a
question no there's a 0.1 chance a 10%
chance the neighbor will just produce a
lie in the 0.9 chance the dilemma if he
speaks the truth so he asked him exactly
one question does my house burn it says
yes it burns but you know that the
probability of this being a lie is 0.1
so in applying Bayes rule I'd like to
first compute the non-normalized
posterior p bar bar now stands for
non-normalized of fire
give me the neighbor just called and the
same for the opposite event of no fire
given the neighbor that said yes it
burns and after you've done this I like
you to compute the normalized values
they'll have to add up to one so please
enter all four values for this homework
