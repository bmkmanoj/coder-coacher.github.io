parser there were three ways to add to
the chart and you've already done one
and two computing the closure or
predicting what's happening next and
shifting and the last way is reductions
so let's say once again that we're
looking at chart I and one element of it
is the state X goes to ABCD coming from
Jay I'm going to write this code I'll
lock it into our parser next States
equals reductions a function that gets
to look at the chart I X ABCD and J and
it's going to return a list of possible
next States for each one we will add it
to the chart and notice if anything
changed reductions are relatively tricky
so my first hint for you is you only
want to do reductions if CD is empty
remember reductions only apply if the
right if the red dot is as far right as
possible my other hint for you is that
you'll have to look back previously at
the chart remember when we work through
examples together we'd start over here
go back over the chart and then go back
to the right you'll have to do the same
sort of thing so we're passing in the
chart try it out this one's a bit tricky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
