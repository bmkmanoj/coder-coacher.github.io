stereotypes we're gonna go back to dr.
marquise bloomer who you may remember
from the motivation and emotions lesson
she's going to talk about gender
stereotypes can we talk a little bit
about how women and men may be
discriminated against because of their
sexual behavior right so actually this
idea of sort of what we would call maybe
gender stereotypes around sexuality and
sexual behavior for both men and women
they do lead to discrimination women
being people who tend to hold less power
in places pretty much all over the world
that isn't different in terms of a
sexual context so they typically have
had less power what I mean by that is
they've had less of a voice less freedom
around their sexual behaviors practices
their beliefs as well as their dress
sexual stereotypes and gender
stereotypes actually hurt both people so
just as women have been confined or
relegated to certain positions in terms
of sexual stereotypes and gender
stereotypes things like if they dress a
certain way then then they are expecting
to have people flirt with them or hit on
them or or they should you know engage
in sexual behavior because they're
dressed a certain way so they're asking
for it those types of practices are
again ways that women's gender and the
expectations men and women have of their
gender around sex have have harmed them
there's been a lot of discrimination a
lot of pain and suffering associated
with that for women women enjoying sex
have been called all sorts of names
women who have more sexual partners than
men have also been called all sorts of
names really harmful things lots of
shaming that's taken place but if you
look at those stereotypes for men it's
also pretty bad the difference is that
they typically have more power in
society so they aren't harmed in quite
the same way but there are stereotypes
that also do affect them things like men
should want to have sex they should want
to have sex with lots of people if they
don't want to do these things then
they're not really a man and there's
something wrong with them and they get
called all sorts of names as well
typically names that are pejoratively
fat
so again that's denigrating to women and
men but definitely people of genders men
and women genders have been harmed by
the stereotypes that exist around
sexuality for both of them and we really
all have to work together to understand
that all people regardless of their
genitalia and their gender
identification have the right to be self
loving and loving of each other in
sexual manners if they have the freedom
and the desire to so choose to be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
