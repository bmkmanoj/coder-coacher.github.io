not be available in your language you
could easily roll out your own I'm
coming up with my own research function
which I call my own assert takes the
condition if the condition is false then
we raise an assertion error now if I
invoke say my own assert on two plus two
equals four very simple test we can run
this and well nothing happens because
the assertion is met however if we
assume the two plus two equals five we
can run this and we get an assertion or
error that's being raised in here and
this gives us almost the same
functionality as the built-in assertions
while you can easily roll out your own
assertion built-in assertions typically
do have a couple of advantages there's
identification the built-in assertion
typically tells you which assertion
failed there's location they tell you
where the assertion failed that is where
in the code they are optional meaning
that they can be turned on or off
although turning assertions of is mostly
a bad idea which we will discuss later
and finally they have standardized
meaning that everybody can immediately
recognize an assertion asset because
they always take the same for in the
language is C and C++ for instance
assertions come with a built-in function
named assert as in Python which you get
by including a special file asserted or
H and then as in Python use assert
except that you put the argument in
parenthesis and again you press the
condition as an argument to the assert
function if this assertion failed you're
going to get a message on the console
right before the program exits and the
message will look something like this
there you go and now you can see that
the message actually has everything we
wanted in our built-in assertions so
first the failing assertion is
identified down here as coming directly
from the code you see the location here
it's in the file food or see in 99 in C
and C++ assertions are optional you can
turn them on and off using a symbol
argument to the compiler and finally
their standardized if you include a
certain age that's always the form and
this is what
let's look for and this is what
programmers understand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
