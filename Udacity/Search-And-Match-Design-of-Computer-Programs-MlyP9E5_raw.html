terms of our API we have a function
match and a function search and they
both take a pattern and a text and they
both return a string representing the
earliest longest match but for matched
the string would only return if it's at
the start of the string for search it'll
be anywhere within the string if they
don't match then they return none we've
also defined an API of functions to
create patterns a literal string an
alternative between two patterns x and y
a sequence of two patterns x and y and
so on and that's sort of the api that we
expect the programmer to program to you
create a pattern on this side and then
the user pattern over here against
attacks to get some result and then
below the line of the API sort of an
internal function we've defined match
set which is not really designed for the
programmer to call it design for the
programmer to go through this interface
but this function is there it also takes
a pattern and a text but instead of
returning a single string which is a
match it returns a set of strings which
are remainders and for any remainder we
have the constraint that the match plus
the remainder equals original text so
here I've written versions of search and
match we already wrote mats at the one
part that we missed out was this
components that pulls out the XY and op
components out of a tuple and I've left
out two pieces of code here that I want
you to fill in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
