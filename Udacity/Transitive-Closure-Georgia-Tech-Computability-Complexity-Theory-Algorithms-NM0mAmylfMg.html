connection defining the transitive
closure of mathematical relations that I
want to cover briefly consider a
relation R over a set a that is to say R
as a subset of a cross a for example a
might represent sports that one can
watch on television and the relation
might be someone's viewing preferences
maybe this individual prefers NBA to
college basketball and NBA to college
football and we also know that he
prefers college football to pro football
since a relation is just a collection of
ordered pairs it makes sense to
represent them as a directed graph and
given these preferences we would like to
be able to infer that this individual
prefers the NBA over the NFL as well in
effect if there's a path from one vertex
to another we'd like to add a direct
edge between them in set theory this is
called the transitive closure of a
relation given what we know already
there's a fairly simple solution just
give each edge weight 1 and then run
floyd-warshall the distance will be
infinity if there's not a path and it
will be the minimum number of edges
traversed otherwise this is more
information than we really need however
you really just want to know whether
there is a path not how long it is
hence in this context we use a slight
variant where the entries in the table
are all bullying's either 0 or 1
instead of integers but otherwise the
algorithm is going to be essentially the
same we initialize the table so that the
entry IJ is 1 if a IJ is in the relation
and 0 otherwise note that I'm letting a
1 through a n be the set a here then we
keep on adding potential intermediate
elements and updating the table
accordingly here I J are in the relation
if they are either in the relation
already or if K access link between them
often we're interested not in the
transitive closure of a relation but in
the reflexive transitive closure in this
case we just set the diagonal elements
to be 1 from the beginning here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
