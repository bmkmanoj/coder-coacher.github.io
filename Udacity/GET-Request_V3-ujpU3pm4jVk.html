looks like and we mentioned that the
request used was a get request but what
does it mean for a request to be a get
request a get request is a type of HTTP
request where a client requests a
specified resource from a server for
example the client can make a get
request for an image on a server and
then the server could return it back a
get request is just one of several kinds
of HTTP requests also called HTTP
methods and it's the most common now
you'll note in this course I'm going to
avoid using the term HTTP method too
much because I don't want to confuse the
term with what we know is methods and
Swift let's look more closely a get
request by reusing our example of
Udacity homepage when you visit Udacity
homepage in a web browser you're making
a get request by typing in the URL
udacity.com
in the address bar you're specifying a
resource in this case the Udacity
homepage from a server somewhere in the
network and you're saying hey get this
for me and when we hit enter the request
is made and we can see that it's a
success because the server's responded
with Udacity homepage but there's so
much more happening than meets the eye
when you make this request in a modern
browser to show you what's really
happening under the hood I'm going to
use a chrome app called
postman if you want to follow along I'll
post the download link in the instructor
notes but you'll need to already have
installed Google Chrome to use it okay
so here's the postman app at the top bar
you can make a request much like we did
in the web browser but here to the left
we can also specify the type of request
for this request we'll leave it as the
default which is git now let's type in
the URL for you to ask these homepage
and hit Send Wow okay so there's a lot
to observe here let's go step by step
for now I'm going to hide this side
panel which shows a history of the
requests that we've made here at the top
we have some tabs for authorization and
headers pre request script and test
we're gonna skip these for now and come
back to them later let's focus our
attention here on the body this is the
response that the server returned when
we made a get request for you to ask
these homepage but it doesn't look
anything like the home page we're used
to seeing it's just a bunch of HTML CSS
and JavaScript code that's because all
of this code is normally loaded
interpreted and read
by our web browser if we click on the
preview option we can see a low fidelity
version of what this would look like if
it was loaded by Chrome next I want to
look at the status section where it says
200 ok this is what is known as a status
code a status code gives us a quick
indication of whether the HTTP request
succeeded failed or something else there
are many different possible status codes
that can be returned for an HTTP request
I'll post a link in the instructor notes
if you want to read about them more the
most important thing to note is that
anytime we get a status code that begins
with the two it means the request was
successful let's hover over the status
code so we can see a little bit of
information about what it means it says
that a 200 status code is the standard
response for successful HTTP requests
and that the actual response depends on
the type of request that was used
because we used a get request up here
we're seeing the entity that corresponds
to the requested resource which in this
case was the Udacity home page in all of
its code also at the bottom of this
description it mentions a new type of
request called a post request which
we'll talk about later in this course
the next thing we see is the time it
took to execute our request in
milliseconds which was 1,350
milliseconds this is important to keep
in mind when we make requests over the
network it does take some amount of time
for us to get a response it's not always
instantaneous so when we start making
these requests in code we'll have to
consider what we want our app to do
while it's waiting on a response now
let's try a different URL this time I'm
going to use a URL that I know doesn't
refer to a page on Udacity web site I'll
go ahead and hit send and this time we
get a response but notice the new status
code which is 404 we hover over the
status code it says the requested
resource can't be found any time we see
a status code that begins with a 4 or 5
it indicates some kind of error but even
though we have an error we still get a
response if we look at the response in
preview mode we see that it's a page
that says we're sorry what you're
looking for doesn't exist this is
commonly referred to as a 404 page not
all websites have these but the awesome
engineers at Udacity have created this
for a for pay
so in case your requests a page that
doesn't exist you still see something
that feels like Udacity z-- normal
website okay I have one more example
this time let's request an image instead
of a web page this is the kind of
request we'll make when we build the app
for this lesson I'll type in my request
and hit Send this time we get an image
as a response instead of HTML code and
that's the last point I want to make
here when we make HTTP requests the data
that we get back can be images text HTML
code and various other types of media if
you have some time I highly recommend
that you download postman yourself and
experiment I'll also post some links in
the instructor notes for other similar
tools in case you don't use Google
Chrome as your normal browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
