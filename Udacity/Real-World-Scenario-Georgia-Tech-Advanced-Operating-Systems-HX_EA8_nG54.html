funny virtual time for logical time but
there are many real-world scenarios
where the logical time may not be good
enough and in such situations the
logical clock may not be sufficient I'll
give you an example let's say that I owe
you some money and I tell you by calling
you on the phone that I'm gonna credit
my account in my local branch at 5 p.m.
I'm telling you on the phone that I'm
gonna credit my account at 5 p.m. and so
anytime after 5 p.m. you can withdraw
money from my bank and we'll be square
now you're a nice guy so you want to
give me some leeway so you tell your
branch that you know at 8 p.m. go ahead
and debit from Kishore's account the
money that used me so your branch is
going to basically do a debit call to
the central bank server asking for the
money that is owed by kishore to be
transferred to your account so that's
what is gonna happen and so you schedule
that at 8 p.m.
you've given me enough time to make sure
that you have indicated to your bank you
have enough money so that my debit
transaction can go through and you would
think it should go through right but it
turns out that your branch is local time
is far ahead of real time where you
thought it was 8 p.m. it was not quite 8
p.m. yet because it's very ahead of real
time and so I am exactly at 5 p.m.
keeping my word exactly at 5 p.m. my
branch happens to be good with the time
it's it's in sync with the real time and
so at 5 p.m. I've done the credit of the
amount that I owe you to my central bank
server but unfortunately the central
bank server in real time it got your
message much earlier than the time at
which I sent my message it's not looking
at any logical time it is looking at
real time saying well there's a debit
transaction coming in is there money in
the bank for paying this debit
transaction no it isn't so your request
is declined and this is coming aboard
because of the fact that in real-world
scenarios logical clocks
good enough and in particular what
caused this problem is the fact that
your notion your branch's notion of real
time is completely at odds with real
time and the reason that can happen is
because the computer at your local bank
may have a clock that is drifting with
respect to real time so it is drifting
meaning that it is not keeping up with
the real time it's either going faster
than real time or it is going slower
than the real time it so happens that my
my branch's time is is perfectly in sync
with the real time but that doesn't help
me
and this is the real-world scenario that
you have to worry about and such
anomalies occur due to two things one is
individual clock drift because if you
think about a clock clock is a piece of
circuitry and you expect that for every
second of real time your clock is also
going to click a tick by the same one
second
but if it doesn't your idea of real time
is going to slowly drift that is called
individual clock drift and also there is
a possibility that there could be a
relative drift between the clocks that
are there in the front processors this
clock can be clicking at a particular
rate and this clock could be ticking at
a different rate from my clock and that
can cause the second source a
discrepancy and these anomalies are
nasty things that we have to avoid in
order to make sure that in real world we
can have some guarantees about what goes
