traits sometimes it's useful to think
about traits among a population of
individuals for example a population is
a particular group or type of people in
an area so although there are many ways
to identify a population a common metric
is geography as you can see here with a
map of the world just as people and
families share common traits because
they're genetically related and they
share a common environment some
Geographic population share common
traits because like families they're
also genetically related and share a
common environment for example here's a
map of the world / countries showing you
the breakdown for the trait of sex for
our purposes sex simply means whether or
not you have male or female reproductive
organs now it is true that it's possible
to have both male and female
reproductive parts and those are called
intersex individuals but for our
purposes we're only going to consider
two categories in the meantime in our
world map here the red or country seems
the more males to females it has in its
population and the more blue a country
appears the more females to males you
have in that country the closer it is to
a more neutral color white so a lighter
blue a lighter red or a white color in
fact this means that the male and female
ratio is roughly equal so what I want
you to do is look at the map here and
tell me which to geographic regions and
the map here have the highest imbalance
of either males or females is it Canada
Russia China Saudi Arabia Australia or
Brazil remember I want you to pick two
geographic regions that have the highest
imbalance of either males or females so
remember to use the legend over here and
then look at the map to see if you can
figure out which countries have the
highest imbalance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
