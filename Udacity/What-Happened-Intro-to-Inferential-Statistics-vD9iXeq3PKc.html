illustrated the concept of type 1 and
type 2 errors but now to wrap up this
lesson let's apply type 1 and type 2
errors to the question of whether or not
a musical lesson will increase
engagement remember that our population
parameter was seven point four seven and
this is from the actual responses from
the survey that I sent out and the
actual population standard deviation was
two point four one our null hypothesis
then will be that the new population
mean after the intervention will not
have a significant change from this
population parameter in other words
there won't be a treatment effect and
the alternative hypothesis is that there
is a treatment effect so the two
parameters will be significantly
different now let's say that we have a
sample of size 30 and the mean
engagement is eight point three however
the true engagement of the population if
we were to implement this musical lesson
will be seven point eight now in real
life we don't know what mu sub song will
be but let's pretend we do if this
happens then which of these four
quadrants represents the results of our
hypothesis test this is a pretty tough
question and it requires you to remember
what we did before and then really
understand type 1 and type 2 errors give
it your best shot let's say our alpha
level is point zero five and this is for
a two-tailed test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
