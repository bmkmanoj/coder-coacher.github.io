genetic code after James Watson and
Francis Crick accurately published the
structure of DNA in 1953 Gamal was one
of the leading scientists trying to
crack the genetic code and figure out
how to translate it into protein
now Gamal had correctly calculated that
three nucleotides was enough to code for
all 20 amino acids and then some but the
real question was whether or not the
genetic code was overlapping or not
in other words gamau favored a model
where a sequence of letters in RNA would
be read in sets of 3 but after reading
the first triplet the second triplet
began with the second letter of the
first triplet and so on now this was
referred to as the overlapping model
because each codon overlapped with
another an alternative model suggested
that there was no overlap and one
triplet was read right after another
triplet and so on so these models which
one do you think would be the most
efficient for information storage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
