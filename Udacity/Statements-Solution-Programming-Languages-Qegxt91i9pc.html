answers together we say that a statement
has to be an identifier followed by an
equal sign followed by an expression
lata la ta is definitely an identifier
using our previous rules that's a
collection of upper and lower case
letters that may include an underscore
the underscore can't come first so this
is an identifier and expression can go
directly to number and one is a number
so this is totally valid here we have
mangeshkar equals 19 plus 29 well
mangeshkar is longer but it's still an
identifier it's a collection of letters
and it may have underscores but it
doesn't then we have the equal sign that
matches and now we're going to use this
rule here expression goes to expression
plus expression to get this plus sign
and then expression will go to number 4
19 and expression will go to number 4 29
I like this here we have lotta equals
lotta plus one this one is tricky
because it's totally valid in Python but
it's not valid in this grammar I haven't
said that expression can go to
identifier so lata is an identifier the
equal sign is an equal sign but over
here I need something like one plus one
I don't yet have a rule that would allow
me to have lotta plus one if I had this
mysterious fifth rule then this would be
in the language of the grammar but I
don't yet so it isn't and then over here
mangeshkar equals twenty-five thousand
minus one that's an identifier equals
and now we're going to use this rule
here expression minus expression this
totally works out lata mangeshkar is a
famous indian playback singer she's
recorded over 25,000 songs a world's
record for quite some time and she's
also received india's highest civilian
honor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
