are going to build out a decision tree a
decision tree algorithm is quite
different than the logistic modeling
algorithm this algorithm analyzes the
data as if it was a series of decisions
this results in a comparison between
each of the different possible outcomes
in order to illustrate the algorithm
let's use a simple example I have a full
basket of a hundred and twenty mms at a
dinner party at the end of the night
some of the mutant and some have not I
want to know if I can predict whether a
specific mmm will get eaten let's get
started with only one predictor variable
color this split would be chosen because
it would produce the largest difference
in percent eaten between the two groups
okay so let's add a second variable
flavor the only possible split is with
or without peanuts with peanuts is
seventy-five percent eaten without
peanuts is 13.3 per set Eden now if we
compare that to color which split would
happen first color or flavor since the
flavor has a larger gap then flavor
would cause the first split once the
first split has happened each split is
treated completely separately so in
order to do the second split we need to
have the full picture of data that lets
only consider the peanut groups for the
second split and the regular group
separately so how would we use the tree
to predict an actual result so let's say
I'm a blue peanut M&amp;amp;M what is the chance
I'm going to get eaten if we trace along
the path for a blue peanut M&amp;amp;M we can
see that at the terminal node there is a
ninety percent chance of being eaten and
that's the general gist of a decision
tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
