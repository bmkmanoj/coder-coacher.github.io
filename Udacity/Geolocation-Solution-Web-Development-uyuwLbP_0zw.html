this so I had to import mini Dom so we
could use that and then we used parse
string from mini Dom which is what we
previously lecture to parse the XML that
were passed in on this parameter then I
use get elements by tag name gml
coordinates sometimes if the XML is more
complex you can't just cheat and find
the one tag name that you're looking for
but in this case we know there's only
going to be one coordinates element in a
valid response so we can just see if
there's any element in here that has
this tag name if we have that element
this should return true we're actually
kind of going out on a limb here if this
wasn't such a simple document such a
simple protocol I'd probably have to
check to see you know other child nodes
through those child do those child nodes
have values that sort of thing I haven't
done any testing that would suggest that
just assuming it's all there it doesn't
work so what I do is if it's all there
we call split which splits on the comma
to get the two parts to launch to the
latitude and then we reverse them return
latitude lunch do so if we print our
response this is what we get now if I
were to change our XML a little bit
let's say we just get rid of the actual
coordinate from the sample XML I passed
in and we run this we get none as our
answer that should work for now good job
if you got that and let's add this to
our program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
