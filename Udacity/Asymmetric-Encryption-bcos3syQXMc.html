algorithm performs transformation to
produce the corresponding ciphertext
that the crucian algorithm reverses the
encryption process that is it takes as
input the ciphertext and produces the
original plaintext instead of using a
single key as in the symmetric
encryption here asymmetric encryption
use a pair of keys one is used for
encryption and the other is useful at
decryption the two keys are paired
mathematically together that is if you
use a key for encryption only the
corresponding paired key can decrypt a
message let's look at the essential
steps in asymmetric encryption first
each user generates a pair of keys that
are paired together mathematically one
is the private key the other is the
public key the public key can be
published for example on the user's
website or on a public repository the
purpose is for everybody to know the
public key but a companion private key
has to be kept as a secret that is only
the user should know his or her own
private key since public keys are meant
to be known by others we can imagine
that in practice a user such as Bob
would have a collection of public keys
of his friends for example in this case
Bob has the public keys of Alice Ted
Mike and joy now suppose Bob wants to
send a private message to Alice Bob will
use Alice's public key which is in his
collection to encrypt a plain text using
a asymmetric encryption algorithm such
as RSA and then transmit the ciphertext
to Alice it is mathematically guaranteed
that only Alice can decrypt this
ciphertext properly into plaintext
because only Alice has the corresponding
companion private key that is if a
public key is used to encrypt a
plaintext into the ciphertext only the
companion corresponding private key can
decrypt the ciphertext properly into the
plaintext therefore in this case only
Alice can see the plaintext</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
