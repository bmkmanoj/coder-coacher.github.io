parser from a slow one to a fast one
that doesn't repeat its work all we need
are these five characters all we have to
do is say let's apply the memo decorator
to parse Adam and then we're done the
recursive call to parse Adam with term
and the remainder as inputs we've done
it once this will be the same call here
we just look it up in the cache table
and we've got the result so notice in
order to make that work I had to make
this function parse Adam be something
had arguments that were hashable the
atom and the texts are both strings and
those are both hashable but the original
call to parse that had a grammar as the
third argument the grammar is a
dictionary and dictionaries are mutable
and so they're not hashable so I
couldn't memorize the whole parse
function and then have parse be called
recursively here that's why I had to
have parse Adam and par sequence the
internal functions inside the definition
of parse so that the grammar would be a
variable that this function knows about
but it's not one of the arguments so
that the memo decorator works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
