even if it really has an imperfect sort
of looking design normally light comes
in here through the the pupil must pass
through this initial clear region and
then has to make it to the back of the
eye called the retina and way here back
in the back of the retina passed layers
of cells if the light can make it
through all of these occluding
structures all of these things blocking
its path and it makes it to the very
back to these oddly shaped cells here
called cone cells then they'll actually
be interpreted as the color that we see
every day now the visible light spectrum
is interpreted by humans through the
detection of three main wavelengths of
light that correspond to three main
colors red green and blue there's a
special type of cell here in the back of
the retina that's able to detect these
three different colors and it's called a
cone cell and there are three different
kinds of cone cells that can recognize
each of the different colors now these
three different types of cone cells can
each detect a certain wavelength of
light remember light is actually energy
and it travels in the form of a wave and
the color spectrum essentially
correlates to certain wavelengths that
our eyes can see the longer wavelengths
are in the red spectrum and the shorter
wavelengths are in the blue spectrum and
the middle wavelengths that we can see
are in the green spectrum each of these
different types of cone cells are
actually able to detect a specific
wavelength of light together these give
you all the colors all the combinations
of all the colors that you can see now
this whole amazing process is possible
because there are proteins like OPN 1lw
that absorb light at each of those
different wavelengths in the case of
opium 1lw it focuses on absorbing light
from the red wavelengths so if this is
the cone cell membrane right we're
really zoomed in here and in the
membrane of the cell there are these
proteins specifically opium 1lw that
absorbs red light and essentially tells
the cell
and then ultimately the brain that hey
this is red light now in the case of the
premature stop codon that we just talked
about in the last exercise the changing
from a cytosine to a thymine causes a
severely shortened protein that doesn't
actually make it to the membrane so now
the cone cell can't detect the red
wavelength of light and it just bounces
away so what I want you to do is think
about this mutation and categorize it
whether you think it's a loss of
function a gain of function or no change
in function mutation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
