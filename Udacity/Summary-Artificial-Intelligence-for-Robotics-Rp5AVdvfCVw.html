important things that we use every day
in robot programming and there were
somewhat complimentary first we talked
about smoothing which took a discrete
path and turn it into a continuous
smooth path and then we turned about how
the robot can follow this smooth path
using a control mechanism called PID
with this you can actually implement
quite a bit of robotics when no matter
what robot you have apply a planner
apply a smoother apply a controller and
it'll do just fine in fact this is about
the level at which our DARPA Grand
Challenge car won the DARPA Grand
Challenge the Google car itself has
little bit more juice in it it considers
the case that the steering wheel itself
is inertia and that the steering which
was driven by something called torque
not by position but leaving this aside
you really get a gist out of what's
happening in robotic driving and now
we're able to really control an actual
robot congratulations that is really
really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
