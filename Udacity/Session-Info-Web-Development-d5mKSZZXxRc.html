and this person had an interesting point
about whether or not storing the session
info in the database was actually better
or not yeah okay so in the general case
the answer is no because if you're
storing sessions in the database that
probably means you're hitting the
database on every page requests because
sessions kind of by definition only
lasts the session so if it's not
permanent data if it's just are you
logged in obviously you have to store
are you logged in in a cookie because
that's how you are logged in you know
things like user preferences you know my
my feeling is if the user is anonymous
and you have a new la anonymous users to
have preferences and a little bit of
state try to store it in the cookie
first because you don't want you know
anonymous users to hit your database you
know say your website gets popular and
they write about the New York Times or
something and you get thousands and
thousands of users before you are
prepared if all of a sudden you've got a
thousand people like I shouldn't say a
thousand thousands and thousands of
people writing temporary stuff into your
database that's gonna hurt now maybe
maybe you know registered users of
course you store them in the database
but I still try to store as much
temporary stuff and cookies as possible
because that's the key to scaling as
stateless getting the database out of
the requests you know hiding your
database reads you know hiding your
database reads behind the cache you know
hiding your database writes behind you
know a queue which is something we
really only talked about unit seven
that's the key to scaling storing
temporary data and cookies which are
designed for that purpose is a very
important part of that okay I think
that's about it yes here yeah I know we
said goodbye a couple of times yeah this
one is for real so first you know Sean
I'd like to thank you you know this
course wouldn't have happened without

of fun on a really cool experience and
you know I'm still hanging out in the
IRC there's still a group of people who
do that so you know come join us if you
want to talk about web apps or whatever
