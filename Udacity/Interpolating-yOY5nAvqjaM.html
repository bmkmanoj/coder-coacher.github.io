interpolation I've put together this
little app and it has two spinners here
the first one has a list of a bunch of
different interpolators like a celery
decelerate bounce decelerate linear
overshoot and the second spinner has
different timings from 100 milliseconds
all the way up to three thousand
milliseconds or three seconds so that
you can see how fast or how slow things
work so if we just select three thousand
milliseconds it's going to be really
slow and just like Roman was saying in
the previous video it's kind of
gratuitous too you know and it's just
too much motion to be bouncing up and
down that much so let's try maybe a nine
hundred milliseconds that looks a little
bit better so let's switch to the code
and see how this works so here's the
code that makes that work we start off
with creating a new instance of our
interpolator because it's different
based off of what the name is we
actually use the Java class for name to
get the class and then instantiate a new
instance but if you were using this in
your own app you would call say new
bounce interpolator directly so after we
have that we call animate on our text
view and set the interpolator in the
duration from our spinner until it to
start in 500 milliseconds and to move
the animation from the bottom of the
screen and then start check the
instructors notes for more information
about interpolators or this sample app
that you can play around with to see how
they work a little bit better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
