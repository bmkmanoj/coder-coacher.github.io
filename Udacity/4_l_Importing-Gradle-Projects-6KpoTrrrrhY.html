work with this one doesn't compile or
build anything it just tells a joke and
we can use it to do all the normal
Gradle stuff we're used to like we can
get all the tasks that this can do and
we can run our tell joke tasks awesome
everything's working now let's try
importing this project into Android
studio so here's the Android studio
splash screen and what we want is this
import project Eclipse ADT Gradle etc
and it tells us to go select our
build.gradle file or some other options
let's go find it
alright here's our super simple
build.gradle file it's the only thing in
this directory Android studio will pop
up a dialog asking you if you want to
use the Gradle wrapper Android studio
always uses the wrapper and always uses
the Gradle build daemon will go ahead
and let Android studio set up the daemon
when Android studio first opens you
might not see anything interesting to
see what's going on with your project
just open up the project tab you still
won't see anything for the moment since
the project pane is configured to
display only the files that are relevant
for an Android build fix that by
clicking on the Android drop down and
selecting project now if we expand out
this directory we can see a whole slew
of files that Android studio has already
created for us note that you can see
your build.gradle file as well as the
Gradle W wrapper scripts as well as a
bunch of other stuff that was added by
Android studio there are several ways to
run Gradle tasks from Android studio the
first is the terminal down at the bottom
left here we can do exactly the same
stuff we were doing from outside Android
studio note that the first time you use
the Gradle wrapper created by Android
studio you may need to add execution
permissions to the wrapper script like
so so now we can get our task list like
normal there we go and we can run our
tell joka task again awesome so we can
do everything we could do from the
command line from inside Android studio
as well there's also an easier way to
run Gradle tasks from Android studio and
that's by opening up the Gradle pane on
the right of the window if we open up
the Gradle scratch directory and we open
up the other tasks we find our tell joke
task we can double click to run it
excellent our task is still working
let's open up our build.gradle file
let's try adding a second jug telling
task to our project
in order to get Android studio to
recognize our second task we need to hit
these little circular arrows again there
we go here's our new task and we can run
it just like the other one a moment ago
we just had to build that Gradle file
and now we've got a directory totally
full of the obscure files and
directories
unfortunately IDE is tend to do that
let's take a look at these various files
and figure out why they're all there the
dot Gradle directory is where Gradle
stores information for incremental build
support
so that's your tasks inputs and outputs
stuff like that the dot idea directory
is where Android studio stores its model
of your project the build directory is
where your build outputs go if this bill
generated any for now it's just holding
on to some information related to the
synchronization between Gradle project
model and Android Studios project model
finally you know the Gradle directory
that's where the wrapper jar and wrapper
properties are stored in the root folder
we have our build.gradle file that we
originally added we also have this dot
IML file which is again part of Android
Studios project model finally we have
the two wrapper scripts and then this
local dot properties file this is how
Gradle can figure out where the Android
SDK is on your machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
