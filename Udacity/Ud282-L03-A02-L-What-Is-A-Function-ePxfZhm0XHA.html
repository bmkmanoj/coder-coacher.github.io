mentioned that functions grouped
together blocks of code to perform a
specific task and we've actually been
using functions throughout this course
whenever you've used system dot out dot
print Lin to print a line you've been
calling the function print Lin which is
a built-in Java function and calling a
function is just referring to that
function by its name and using it in a
program and you can call the same
function as many times you want in a
program think of when we've written
multiple print line lines of code each
of these is a function call and every
time you make a function call Java will
recognize the name of the function and
it will look inside its own code for a
function definition with the same name
and we'll get more into the difference
between function Colleen and function
definitions in a bit function
definitions include the name of a
function and all the code that function
contains and when you call a function
like when you say system dot out dot
print Lin it's equivalent to executing
all the code in the definition of print
one so when you call print Lin over and
over again all these calls will refer to
the same one function definition Java
will see a call like this and then look
to the definition to execute the code
inside of this function so let's check
out this definition here's the function
definition for printing a line it
contains several lines of code that work
to display a message on our screen and
actually this is only a portion of the
code included in print line you can see
that it's definition starts out with
these words public and void and then the
name of our function print 'ln then it
takes in a string which we input and
then it has curly braces that group
together all the code that print line
executes and this block of code is
pretty big and quite complicated here we
see an if statement that's checking if
our string X is equal to null and no
basically means that it doesn't exist so
this checks that there is a string to
print then there's a lot more code to
correctly display the string it even
uses more functions inside like this
write function to display our string to
our screen just imagine if we had to
write this code over and over every time
you wanted to display
luckily since print line is a function
were able to use all this code as many
times as you want just by referring to
the function name with a function call
so function calls like this let us print
stuff out to our screen and we don't
need to know the specifics of a code
being executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
