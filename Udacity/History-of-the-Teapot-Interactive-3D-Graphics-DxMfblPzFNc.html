been a few teapots in these lessons I
hope you like them because you'll be
seeing lots more of them as we go the
teapot model was created by Martin
Newell one of the pioneers of computer
graphics among other accomplishments he
co developed an early rendering method
called the painters algorithm and its
seminal work in the area of procedural
modeling he also founded the company
ashlar incorporated a computer-aided
design software firm the model was
inspired by a real live Malita teapot
manufactured in 1974 back then there
weren't many good models to use for
rendering especially for displaying
materials objects made of cubes
cylinders and spheres and so on can only
take you so far
in 1975 Martin Newell at the University
of Utah at the time was talking about
this problem with his wife Sandra they
were just sitting down for tea so she
suggested that he model a tea set he
made a sketch of the silhouette on graph
paper the drawing represented a
recognizable profile of a teapot it
doesn't match the real world teapot the
spout and the knob on the lid are a bit
different for example he described these
curves by using what are called cubic
Bezier splines a spline is a fancy word
for a type of curve these spline curves
are formed by carefully placing a few
points called control points a surface
is then formed by using spline curves in
two different directions to define a
patch see the additional course
materials torn more about this process
to render these patches interactively we
often convert them into grids of
triangles this type of modeling is
useful for creating all sorts of curved
surfaces such as car bodies when Newell
created the teapot he also made some
other models to create a whole set not
half as well-known the tea cup and
saucer make up a pretty nice little
model at least they look good from this
angle well not great though there's no
shadow so the cup looks like it's
floating over the saucer if you rotate
the view its secret is revealed there's
a large hole in the middle of it there's
also a teaspoon model which is pleasing
from any view I was surprised by how
easy it was to display these models once
I had my teapot demo working the text
files a patch data for the tea cup and
tea spoon are available on the web the
time stamp on these files is from 1991
digital data doesn't rot a nice feature
of using cubic Bezier the data
description is that the text files were
each around 8,000 bytes for a lot of
applications nowadays that's less than
the size of an empty save file let's get
back to the teapot
like the teacup the teapot also didn't
originally have a bottom after all a
teapot is usually sitting on some table
top so it doesn't really need one most
of the time for patches defining a
bottom were added later by Frank Crowe
in 1987 some graphics practitioners
consider adding a bottom to be heresy so
be careful about what choices you make
and whom you show your teapots one of
the obvious difference between the real
world and virtual teapots is the
vertical scale Martin Newell shared his
teapot dataset with other researchers
his original sketches scale matches the
real world teapot but the computer
graphics model evolved to be squatter
I've seen two stories in print about how
this happened and being in print makes
it true right the more reputable one is
that Jim Blinn one of the early users of
the teapot dataset decided that the
teapot simply looked more pleasing when
squished the other story I've seen is
that the display Blinn was working on
didn't have square pixels rather than
mess with the cameras transform he
decided to scale down the teapot
vertically to compensate I like this
version a lot since blend has a
well-known quote of all it takes is for
the rendered image to look right
I asked Martin knew all about these two
stories and he thinks the non-square
pixels may have been the original reason
but that blends aesthetic sense could
well have kept the model that way Martin
himself prefers the squat version
speaking of looking right there's a
noticeable gap between the lid and the
body of the teapot
I've taken the liberty in this course of
widening the little bit so that this gap
is not noticeable Shh don't tell anyone
lens used to the teapot in his research
popularized it in the size change stuck
the teapot is a great object to render
for a number of reasons first and
foremost we have a good mental model of
what the teapot should look like so can
easily identify bugs the curvature of
the surface varies considerably
especially on the spouts and handle
causing the shading to change in
interesting ways some of the spline
patches form a dense set of triangles
others less so which gives some
rendering algorithms a workout since the
teapot is not some simple convex form
such as a block or cylinder it casts a
shadow on itself
another good test case my small
contribution to the cause was an open
source program that generated the teapot
this was back in the late 1980s long
before the term open source even existed
i ported this code to three J's for this
course many people consider the teapot a
standard model back in 1987 Jim Marvel
created this classic image showing the
teapot as the sixth platonic solid
next to the tetrahedron cube and so on
really I've seen a lot more teapots
render than I have dodecahedra the
teapot is an iconic object that is the
symbol of 3d computer graphics there are
other famous models out there
the VW bug the Stanford Bunny the sponza
palace but the teapot is by far the most
celebrated keep an eye out for it in the
first Toy Story movie and in the
Simpsons 3d episode if you want to see
the real teapot in all its glory it's on
display at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View California now that
you're aware of the teapot you'll start
to notice that popping up when you least
expect it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
