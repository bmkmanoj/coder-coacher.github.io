applications you need to get a key that
gives you access to the Google Maps
Android API this is pretty easy to do
but it involves taking a few steps out
of Android studio for the time being
you're going to be working in terminal
so as you can see I've opened my
terminal here the first thing you need
is the sha-1 fingerprint for your app
Google Maps uses this as a way to
identify your application so it can give
your app good service this fingerprint
is a machine readable attribute of a
certificate and a certificate is a way
of determining that your app is real
just like in the real world the
certificate is a sign of an authority
where you can call upon a third party to
certify that you are who you say you are
now we're just going to use a debug
certificate for this as it's easier for
learning purposes the debug certificate
is issued to you by yourself now later
if you want to release your app to the
Play Store you'll need a publication
certificate which is verified by Google
if you want to do that follow the
instructions on the developer website
linked below the first thing that you'll
need to do is to locate your keystore
file for debugging using the terminal
it's called imaginatively enough debug
keystore on a Mac or Linux it's at CD
squiggle slash dot Android so note that
when you put a dot in front of a folder
like this it's usually hidden so just
note that you may need to unhide it
if you're using Windows it'll be at C
colon slash users slash your user name
slash dot Android and remember it could
also be hidden on Windows this is the
directory that contains the debug
keystore and I can use this to get the
fingerprint and I'll show you how to do
that next the command to get the
certificate is the key tool command and
the key tool command you tell it your
key store and you can see the key store
location is dot Android debug keystore
you also just give it an alias and
calling it the Android debug key and the
password and user name is just Android
when you're using debug so when I press
enter you'll see my sha key is listed in
this certificate the certificate
fingerprints are here md5 sha-1 and
sha-256 so just keep track of the sha-1
key I would just recommend leaving the
terminal window open because you'll be
needing that data in a moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
