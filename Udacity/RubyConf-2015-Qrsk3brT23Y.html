Ruby community from a lot of other
technical communities is a sense of
community so we're not just programmers
where people were human beings with
feelings for each other and we build
relationships with people not just
through contributions by actually
getting to know them for me it renews my
my excitement about working maybe every
single time I come to one you get
hallway time with these people and
they're just amazing people its exposure
to a lot of different ideas for me it's
been the contacts that I've made over
the years at various conferences a lot
of times it's like repeated people that
I meet 45 minutes of time or 10 minutes
of time over the course of five or six
conferences and then I finally feel like
I can like I know them well enough and
if I was looking for a job maybe I could
talk to them about it I mean all the
data says that were smarter together
than we are apart and so programming is
mostly a collaborative activity and and
if we don't practice that early you can
develop the mistaken notion that
programming is about being clever and
that's a bad idea the programming itself
is the kind of a lot of human factor I
cap so the comforts like this is a huge
chance to meet and
and then to know new ideas so doubt be
doubt make you more creative and then
and the conference will and the meeting
people will inspire you to be better
