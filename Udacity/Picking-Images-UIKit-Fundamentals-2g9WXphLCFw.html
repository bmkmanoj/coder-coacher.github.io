important to approach it one small piece
at a time we don't recommend that you
jump straight into writing me me it's
easier to experiment if you create a
temporary Xcode project that you don't
plan on keeping to learn to pick images
for example you might want to create a
one-button app that picks and displays a
single image the smallest possible
project that will let you learn what you
need to know baby steps to the meme
generator so here I've made a simple
project to experiment with and since the
meme editor has a toolbar at the bottom
of the screen I'm going to go ahead and
drag one of those in and I'll position
it and set its constraints the toolbar
comes with this button but I'm going to
go ahead and change its label to pick
and you see I've already got an image
view so you can go ahead and drag one of
those in and set its constraints now I'm
going to close this outline view for a
minute and open up the assistant editor
and then we can add an outlet for our
image view
now let's go down to our button and
we'll add an action for our button let's
call it pick an image and that ought to
do it for storyboard so we'll focus on
our viewcontroller file when i get rid
of this extra method for now and here in
the pic and image method that we just
added we want to launch our
uiimagepickercontroller just like we did
in lesson two so we add these two lines
to present the image picker and let's
run it and see how it looks and there we
go we can choose from our albums so
we're making progress but when I choose
a picture I can't really tell that it's
being chosen we still need to implement
the delegate pattern and set our view
controller as the delegate of the image
picker next up we'll investigate the
delegate protocol so we'll know what
method will be called when the picker
has an image chosen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
