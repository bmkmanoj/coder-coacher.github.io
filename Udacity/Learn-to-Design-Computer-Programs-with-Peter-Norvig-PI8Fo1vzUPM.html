great class cs101 introduction to
computer programming thanks Peter it's
been a lot of fun and I heard you're
going to be teaching a new class that
starts soon
that's right I'm starting off with 212
design of computer programs it's all
about the process of design how you go
from informal description of a problem
to working code through a process of
decomposition and how to distinguish a
good design from maybe you're not so
good just hold it that sounds really
useful what what students should be
learning after 101 what's the first unit
about well first unit is actually about
ranking hands in the game of poker I
think I probably should learn that hmm
well let's play okay well I am gonna bet
hmm billion nano dollars
I'll see your 101 and I'll raise you to
12 well I'm gonna go all-in and I also
want the shirt off your back the shirt
off my back
well I'm pretty confident so I'm all-in
- what do you got I got three kings and
two jacks full house well I got four
aces and we'll soon see how to program a
computer to know that four aces Lisa for
life it's good that you didn't want my
shirt then okay we'll see you in class
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
