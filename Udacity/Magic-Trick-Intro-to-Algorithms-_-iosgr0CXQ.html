should be the case that all of these
edge boxes are checked off and you ended
up with an actor and now this is the
magic trick part I'm going to tell you
which actor you ended up with and the
answer is Kevin Bacon tada
pretty neat huh let's try that I'm going
to follow maybe a different path than
you did but I'm going to do my best to
try it out all right just to try to
thwart this ah maybe I'll go directly to
Kevin Bacon so I'll visit this edge now
I'm a Kevin Bacon I go to Dustin Hoffman
I go to Susan Sarandon I go to Julia
Roberts I can't go to Kevin Bacon now
because it'll be at a dead end I visited
all the other edges that have gone
through Kevin Bacon so I'll go to Dustin
Hoffman - Robert De Niro - Meryl Streep
again Dan Hathaway back - Julia Roberts
and now I can go to Kevin Bacon and be
done that may or may not have been the
same path that you followed but I did
end up at Kevin Bacon you can try this a
couple different ways and you'll see
you'll always end up with Kevin Bacon
all right so that's our magic trick now
this example illustrates two things that
are central to this course the first is
the idea of a social network we often
think of social networks as being
particularly big xizt these days but
really what a social network is is
connections between individuals they
capture relationships between them these
days of course you the ubiquity and
scope of social network data is
exploding and clever computer software
is needed to reveal interesting patterns
and answer important questions about
this data it's a really neat area the
second focus of this course is on the
magic of algorithms algorithms are just
how we organize computations to solve a
particular problem some algorithms are
really straightforward but other
algorithms take advantage of subtle
mathematical properties to quickly and
accurately provide an answer those are
the ones that feel like magic so with
that said now I'm going to try to tell
you how this trick actually worked and
what it tells us about these kinds of
structures so let me first point out
that this kind of structure where you've
got a set of sort of circles and lines
connecting between them is what we in
computer science and discrete math call
graph in this particular graph the
actors are playing the role of nodes
sometimes called vertices and the movies
are playing the role of edges or links
I'll probably mostly say nodes and edges
which kind of mixes a metaphor but
that's how I'm used to saying it we can
also talk about the degree of a node in
the network so for example this Dustin
Hoffman node here is a node in the
network and it's got degree four because
there are four edges coming out of it
one two three four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
