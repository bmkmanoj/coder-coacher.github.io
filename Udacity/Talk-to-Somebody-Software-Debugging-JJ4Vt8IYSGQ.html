a colleague or a friend what you're up
to this is the problem i'm working on
this is what I'm seeing this is what I
tried out my experience in two out of
three cases the problem resolves itself
simply by telling it when I was a
teaching assistant at the University
students would come to me and come up
with all sorts of problems now i'm a
professor they only come with a hard /
but when i was a teaching assistant they
would come along and say something like
oh andreas and dressed you know i have
this problem over here he hears this
loop and in this loop we have this
binary search tree in this binary search
he you know I've been adding to a medic
two elements here having added three
elements here and more and more and more
and now i'm doing this and i'm doing
that and i'm deleting it over here but
see and of course i didn't understand a
single thing but it was still there and
nodding and saying yes yes yes sure as
you do but then the student would come
up and say oh actually actually now that
now that I'm saying it I'm not deleting
anything at all I think yes it must be
if the element is not in the trade yes
dad said the element is not in the
street that's why it's not anything
Thank You Andres thank you so very much
everything is just beautiful thank you
so much for helping me out here I was
happy Juden was happy and I hadn't done
anything are of course occasionally
there were also problems where students
would really come along and have real
problems and then ask me with a big
puzzle face and then I would have to
come up again I said okay okay okay can
you repeat this a bit slower so what's
this thing about foo and the binary tree
and the quotes and the tags and
everything and then we would go into
regular deep but in two-thirds of all
cases yep simply by listening I would be
able to debug thing hey I was a king of
debugging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
