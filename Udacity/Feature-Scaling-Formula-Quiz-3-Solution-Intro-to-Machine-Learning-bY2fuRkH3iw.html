this formula is 0.41 seven so 0.41 seven
is the new value of the feature that
belongs to the hundred and forty pound
person so the way we did this is we take
our x-min and x-max we plug them into
the formula and we plug in the 140 as
well in the position for the sort of old
value of x and from that we can compute
X Prime and one of the features of this
formula for rescaling features is that
your transformed features will always be
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 now this has some benefits
and some disadvantages one of the
benefits is that you have a very
reliable number as to what you can
expect in the output one of the
disadvantages is that if you have
outliers in your input features then
they can kind of mess up your rescaling
because your X min and your x max might
have really extreme values so now what I
want to do is I want to give you a
programming quiz where I have you
actually programmed this up yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
