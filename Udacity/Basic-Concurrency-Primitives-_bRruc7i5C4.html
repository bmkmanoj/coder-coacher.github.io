schedule it on a pier am but here the
question where do DAGs come from the
answer is from you but you need a
programming model to generate the DAGs
let me show you one that I think is
especially clean and elegant here's the
dag for a divide and conquer algorithm
to compute a reduction you've argued
that its work optimal and it has
logarithmic span now I want to give you
an algorithm that produces this dag
let's start with just a sequential
algorithm that implements the divide and
conquer scheme so here's the pseudocode
for such an algorithm it takes an array
a of length n and if there are at least
two elements it does divide and conquer
so recursively calls itself on each half
of the array and returns the sum
otherwise the array is just of size one
and it returns that element now what you
can observe is that the two recursive
calls are independent of one another
now since the two recursive function
calls are independent I'm going to give
you a special keyword to mark that fact
that keyword is called spawn the target
of a spawn is always either a function
call or a procedure call in this case
I'm showing a function call now the
spawn keyword is a signal to either the
compiler or the runtime system that the
target is an independent unit of work by
inserting the spawn you're effectively
saying that the target may be executed
asynchronously from the caller any time
a processor is available now even though
these two calls are independent units of
work notice that they produce
intermediate results that then have to
be combined in other words there's a
dependence from a and B and the return
statement that means in addition to
spawns we also need a way to indicate
these kinds of dependences for that I'll
give you a second special keyword called
sync so one question - which spawns does
a given sync apply so we will use a
particular convention which is that the
sync waits for any spawn that has
occurred so far within the same stack
frame if you need a refresher on call
stacks and stacks rains please see the
instructors notes let me make one final
remark about spawn and sync
now suppose you leave the sink out even
if you leave sink out there will always
be an implicit sink at the return
immediately before going back to the
collar let me show you what that means
by transforming this code to match the
note so instead of return of a plus B
we'll generate three statements the
first will evaluate the operand a plus B
the second will perform the sink and
then finally we'll return the value to
the caller and notice where the sink
appears and you transform the other
return in the same way now an important
point even with this transformation the
program is still wrong can you see why
notice that the sink appears after the
sum now the two spawned calls are only
guaranteed to be complete at the sink
therefore the values of a and B might
not yet be valid at that point now the
fact of implicit sinks will constrain
the kinds of DAGs that this programming
model can produce the style of
parallelism in such tags is sometimes
called nested parallelism now once you
see how the pseudocode gives rise to a
dag you'll understand where the term
nested parallelism comes from let's go
back to the correct code now what I want
you to do is to try simulating the
algorithm to see how the dag unfolds so
in particular let's say we start to
execute a reduce on an array of size 4
the first step is to enter the reduced
call that creates the first unit of work
within the dag
then there's the conditional test then
you encounter the spawn here's where
things get interesting the spawn creates
a new branch in the dag essentially the
spawn signals that there is a new
independent of work that's ready to go
and it creates a new path as well now in
the meantime the current path will
continue so this is an extremely
important point that the spawn creates
essentially two independent paths one
path carries the new work and the other
path is the path that continues
executing immediately after the spawn
now while the main path is happily going
about its business
the newly spawned path is a recursive
call and there
for it has to generate its own subgraph
now you are traveling along the main
path and so you'll encounter the second
spawn this branching will happen again
next you'll reach the sink the sink
waits for the previous spawns to
complete in terms of the dag that should
create some dependence edges between
these sub graphs and the sink point
control then goes to the return
statement and you'll evaluate a plus B
and then finally return that value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
