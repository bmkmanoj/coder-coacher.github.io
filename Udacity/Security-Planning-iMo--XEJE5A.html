security when we talk about security
here obviously we're talking about cyber
security so of course the first thing
you're gonna ask is you talked about
what is of value what are the assets
what needs to be secured you've been
asked to come in and plan but the next
thing you have to say is if something
has to be secured whose responsibility
is it to do that so who is responsible
for it okay once we do that the next
thing then we're gonna say well security
can require some controls okay so once
you have that you say well we know who's
responsible for it we know what kind of
things they're doing or what controls
they're putting in place but our people
really support it to do what they need
to do do they have the budgets do they
have the authority and one thing to keep
in mind is that no matter how well we do
all these things that we're talking
about the risk is never going to be a
zero so the chance or likelihood that
something might go wrong well it's going
to be there and if something does go
wrong
unfortunately that were to happen how do
we respond to that how do we recover
from that adverse event that has
happened because some control either
didn't exist or didn't function as it
should have and of course if we had
people who were responsible for doing
certain things in our security planning
that we did and something that happens
there has to be accountability so in the
planning process we always have to sort
of keep in mind that we never gonna get
hundred-percent security okay there's
the risk is now going to be zero so we
have to worry about we sort of focus on
prevention detection but then of course
we have to focus on response and
recovery as well and the planning
process has to cover all those aspects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
