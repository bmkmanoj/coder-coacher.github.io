automating the retrieval of data so far
we've only discussed the fax machine
replacement use case where dr. Johnson
sends a patient's heart to dr. Jones
when he refers Mahler to her supposed
dr. Jones wants information from dr.
Johnson suppose Marla has started
recording her blood glucose readings at
home and dr. Johnson wants to retrieve
the most recent ones to see how she's
doing suppose Marla has established a
personal health record and wants it
automatically updated whenever there's
new information in any of her medical
records these are all examples of pull
where the recipient not the sender
initiates the message accomplishing this
is still in the future but a group of
experts have proposed how it might be
done as shown here using some new
standards with indirect for requesting
information and sending back a response
this would be done using specially
formatted XML documents similar to
constructs that already exist in quality
reporting and that will see in less than
eight another interesting aspect of this
proposal that's not specifically limited
to direct is that all of the patients
data would be stored in a repository
that would receive and respond to these
requests presumably based on each
patient's information sharing
preferences many people propose
something like this to simplify the
privacy issues we'll discuss in less
than four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
