is the third one the reason for that is
either the first to make it very easy
for Alice to cheat for the first choice
we're only looking at the first bit out
of the encryption so if she tries a few
different keys she's likely to find ones
that produce outputs that differ in the
first bit very easy to find one with
this property for the second one it's
not easy to find exactly this property
finding this equality would be just as
hard as it is with the third property
but the problem is Bob does not know the
127 bits that are added so Bob is only
looking at the first character here and
finding two keys that have this property
would be very easy so in this case the
only one that makes sense is this one
when we're thinking about encrypting
files and other things this isn't quite
the right answer for padding in most
cases this solution only works when Bob
knows the actual size of the input and
agrees with Alice in advance to know
that all padded bits should be zeros
when you don't know the size this
doesn't quite work because if the
message ends with zero bits and we start
to padding with zero bits we don't know
where the actual end was so the usual
solution to this and there are several
possible solutions is to start the
padding with a 1 bit and then all zeros
to the end of the message that means if
the message actually ended here if this
was the end of a block if the message is
an even number of blocks we need an
extra block of just padding to indicate
that we got to the end in this case
since Alice and Bob both know that
there's only one bit for the coin toss
as long as they agree in advance that
the padding will be all 0 bits that
would be ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
