change when we have different
distributions on this positively skewed
distribution which do you think is true
do you think the mean is less than the
median which is less than the mode or do
you think the mean is the greatest and
the median is the smallest or do you
think the mode is less than the median
is less than the mean or do you think
the median is the greatest and the mode
is the smallest now remember on the
x-axis we go from least to greatest so
on this distribution think about where
the mean meeting and mode would lie on
the x axis and choose which one of these
you think is true this is a really
difficult question that requires you to
think about everything we've talked
about so far how the median and mode are
not affected as much by outliers as the
mean how the mode is not affected by
outliers at all and how the median will
barely change if an outlier is added
