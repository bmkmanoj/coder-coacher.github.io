Jinja makes it easy to do this there are
two ways I'll show you the way
that's simplest first they've got the
syntax for adding a pipe and then a
filter there are a couple there are lots
of actually built in filters in the
Jinja one of them is called escape so if
you say when you print your item if you
say pipe escape it'll actually get
escaped let's see what this looks like
in our browser now when I reload this
page the junk is actually getting
escaped and if I look at the source code
for this page we can see down here that
ginger ran it through an HTML escaping
function and replaced the less than
symbol with ampersand less than and the
greater than symbol with ampersand hi
greater than just like we did in the
previous lesson and again you can see
that down here with the h1 but that's
not how I prefer to do things in any
templating language because it's a
little air prone if you forget to put
this in you've got a security hole there
is another way around this however if
you go when you initialize Jinja if you
say this auto escape equals true ginger
will automatically escape all variable
substitutions so let's make sure this is
still working in our browser I reload
this page trust me i reloaded it nothing
changed if we check our source code
again nothing changed we can see it's
all skipped properly here the reason I
like to do this is that prevent you from
accidentally making mistake it's a lot
easier to see that oh I need to deal
with this input when it's here then it
is to see a subtle error or you know not
be able to see it at all when a user's
trying to hack your website so I always
in every templating language that I use
look for the equivalent of auto escape
equals through and so far everyone I've
used has something along this line now
what if you actually want to display the
HTML well there's a filter for just that
you can say safe pipe safe and so if you
know the HTML is safe you can undo it
this way and I feel like this is better
you opt in to the unsafe way rather than
opting into the safe way so if I save
this and we go back to our browser and I
reload this page we can see that it's
rendering unsafely again but at least
this time we did it on purpose we knew
what to expect and you do this if you
want to
you know sanitize the output a little
bit for example if you're building a
comment page and you want the users to
have some amount of formatting but not
everything you can only allow certain
things and then print it using this
filter but anyway let's get that out of
here because we don't we don't trust our
shopping cart users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
