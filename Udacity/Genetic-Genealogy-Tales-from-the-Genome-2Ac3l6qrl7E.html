right or wrong answer there are several
different relationships that we could
predict for this individual great
grandparent grand uncles aunts first
cousins and there's a lot of information
we could use to help figure out which of
those groups best fits we could look at
the age of the individuals we could
compare the Y and mitochondrial
chromosomes the haplogroups to see how
that fits in we can even look at
interesting patterns of X chromosome
matching obviously the more information
that's able to be shared between the two
individuals is going to facilitate the
best particular guess that we're able to
give that person to tell them what the
possible relatedness is now as far as
advice to give to help them connect
probably some of the best advices
whatever it takes for them to be
prepared for the outcome that it could
be as you can imagine these
relationships and these surprises and
non surprises very differently vary from
person to person I'm going to draw your
attention one more time to the family
rainbow that we've seen in lessons five
and lessons 11 in this course the
representation of helping you see what
the different genetic relatedness what
your relationships are with different
people in your family in this sort of
hierarchical way one hundred percent do
you fifty percent to your mother's fifty
percent to your parents and siblings
twenty-five percent on the next rung
12.5 percent on the next run and you
keep going out and each time you go out
you short a half the amount of
information ultimately you've got to be
a good Sherlock Holmes you've got to use
context clues and you got to talk to
people genetic genealogy is an amazing
profession</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
