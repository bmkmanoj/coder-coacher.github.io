concurrently that's true so one of the
limiting factors of a website is how
many requests a machine can handle at
once you know each each time a user
connects to your machine that uses
what's called a connection a connection
stake memory they take CPU to deal with
and of course you know the CPU to handle
the request so you know we want to scale
so we can handle more requests
concurrently how about storing more data
yep that can be a reason to scale
sometimes you're storing so much data
that I won't fit on one machine or in
one you know one database or won't fit
in memory or you need more disk space
you knows all sorts of reasons that data
might be a limiting factor memory disk
speed and that's another reason to scale
so we're more resilient to failure yes
absolutely you know sometimes you add
multiple machines into your system you
know you have multiple databases we
talked about that in in unit 3 we talked
about replication you know replication
is important for databases so that if
one of those machines dies or goes
offline you don't lose any data and your
website still works same with your
application service where your programs
are running sometimes those break or you
know go offline or become disconnected
or for whatever reason aren't accessible
and so you have multiple ones so you're
resistant to failure and finally to
serve more requests faster yes this is
also an answer it's similar to serving
more requests concurrently which
requires you know being the ability to
handle multiple connections or many
connections serving requests faster may
require a bigger machine or some caching
there's lots of techniques for doing
this and that falls under the umbrella
of of scaling so these are all good
reasons to scale and there are there are
a handful more but these are the types
of things are going to be talking about
