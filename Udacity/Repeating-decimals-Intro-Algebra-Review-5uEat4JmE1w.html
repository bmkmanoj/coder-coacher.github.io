go on forever for example let's say we
want to convert one third to a decimal
let's try doing the same method we did
before so this is the same thing as 1/3
and again for precision we'll add a few
trailing zeros here and we'll add a
decimal point right here so how many
times does 3 go into 10 and how many
times does 3 go into 10 @ b 3 3 times 3
is 9 let's do our subtraction and we get
one we'll bring our zero down and now
how many times does 3 go into 10 here
once again it'll go in three times and
we get 9 we do our subtraction and what
do you know we get one again we bring
down or zero and same as before three
goes into 10 three times and it looks
like there's a pattern here it looks
like we could just keep going on forever
and you just keep adding more threes and
in fact that's true this is called a
repeating decimal it's called a
repeating decimal because the three here
repeats on forever so we can write this
a couple of ways the fraction one-third
is equivalent to 0.3 with a bar over it
the bar over the top here means that the
3s go on forever but because there's a
bar we don't have to keep writing the 3s
sometimes this is also written as 0.33
with a bar over it it's the same thing
we could also use rounding and if we
decide to round to two decimal places
that means we look at these two threes
and we move over to the right one and
because this is less than five we can
just ignore it so I will use this symbol
which means about equal to 0.3 38
rounded off all the threes after the
first two decimals we can write one
third is approximately equal to 0.33 now
can you tell me what is 17 as
decimal round your answer to two decimal
places and enter it here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
