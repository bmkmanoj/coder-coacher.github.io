will allow us to start the audio
playback and change the state of the
buttons remember that when reaching from
code to UI element will use ib outlets
and from UI element to call our code
will use an IB action we're going to
start with ib outlets instead of
dragging each button and using the
assistant editor an easier way is to
write out the IB outlets in code and
then just connect them via interface
builder open the place sounds view
controller dot Swift file and at the
following lines here inside the class
these are the IB outlets for the six
playback buttons and the stop button now
we just need to connect these ib outlets
open the main dot storyboard file and
select the play sounds view controller
scene make sure the document outline is
open and that you can see all the
buttons with the ctrl key held down drag
from the place sounds view controller
down to the snail button and select the
snail button as the outlet this is
connected the iboutlet name snail button
to the actual snail UI button let's do
the same for the other buttons with a
control key held down connect the rabbit
button the chipmunk button the Darth
Vader button the echo button the reverb
button and the stop button now our view
controller code can reach out to all of
the UI button using these ib outlets the
next step is to connect the buttons to
an IV action so that when you press a
button the code inside our place sounds
view controller will run from what
you've learned so far you might be
thinking we need to create seven ib
action functions one for each button
there's a better way with less
duplication of code and i'm going to
show you that here we're going to create
to IV action functions want to handle
all six playback buttons and want to
handle the stop button open the play
sounds view controller dot Swift file
underneath the ib outlets you've just
created add these two functions we have
an ib action function to play the sound
and we have an ib action function to
stop playing sound now we just need to
connect the six playback buttons to the
play sound for button I be action we
also need to connect the stop button to
the stop button pressed ib action let's
go back to the main dot storyboard file
and select the place sounds view
troller seen for this step it helps to
have all the buttons visible in the
document outline you may need to open
the disclosure triangles as I've done
here with the control key held down
select the snail button and drag into
the play sounds view controller select
the place sound for button function from
the pop-up let's do the same for the
rabbit button with the control key held
down drag to the place sounds view
controller and select play sound for
button follow these steps for the
chipmunk button the Darth Vader button
echo button and reverb button all six
play buttons are calling the same I be
action function for the stop button we
need to connect it to the stop button
pressed I be action let's run and see if
everything is wired up correctly press
the Run button here to start pitch
perfect on the iOS simulator let's just
quickly record and stop so we can
transition to the play sounds view
controller if we press on the snail
playback button we can see the place
sound for button function is getting
called here in the console let's try it
for the other five buttons lastly let's
check that the stop button is wired up
by pressing on it as well that was a bit
of work but now we can reach into all of
the buttons from our view controller
using ib outlets and have the button
call our code using the IV actions now
that our user interface is set up we can
start writing our audio playback code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
