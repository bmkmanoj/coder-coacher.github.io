review here's a brief list of some
notable ones the class resources page
points you to further information about
them what we've been talking about or
sometimes called Fagin reviews vagin was
an IBM researcher who first studied them
and proposed the structuring that we're
talking about but a more recent and
alternative approach is called pair
programming which is part of extreme
programming an agile development method
and this was studied by Laura Laura
Williams it suggests that review is part
is performed synchronously with with
coding or developing of an artifact by
having a partner looking over the coders
shoulder pointing out problems at the
time that that coders is doing his or
her job or that designer is doing their
design another alternative is what's
called pass around reviews these are
typically conducted by email this is
often applied in open source projects
where the people aren't co-located and
the source code management system alerts
participants to take a look when a new
change or new file has been checked into
the source control system and in any of
these approaches there's the possibility
of applying tools tools might be
different sirs to compare versions the
source control management system itself
isn't as I've indicated and there are
also program analyzer tools that can
provide enforcement and feedback and
examples here are lent you may have
heard of the lint program or code check
which is a plug-in into eclipse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
