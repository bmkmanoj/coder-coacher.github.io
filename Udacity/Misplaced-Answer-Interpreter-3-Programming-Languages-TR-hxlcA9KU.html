evaluate a few statements on
interpreters the first statement reads
every operation can be sensibly applied
to every type of value this is not true
let's take a look at the + operator if
you add two strings it's sensible that
it can catch them and it's equally
sensible that adding two numbers is
equivalent to adding them under the +
operator however adding a string and a
number is not a sensible operation this
doesn't really make sense what we would
do with this do we turn string into a
number and add the Maris medically or do
we can cat you'da with the five and get
a new string in most interpreters this
is a problem the second statement reads
the medium and expression can depend on
its context this is true at its core
this question is dealing with the notion
of scope let me show you an example in
Python if I run this code two values
will be print it out first six and then
five because within the function we
defined X to be six and then print it
out the value is six but outside of the
function the meaning of X is 5 this
implies that X the expression just X can
mean two different things and its value
is dependent on the contexts in whether
it's in a function or outside a function
or more precisely the scope of X
statement three reeds we can use a
single dictionary as an environment to
track JavaScript variables this is false
as we saw in lecture it's necessary to
use different dictionaries for different
levels of scope here I have a diagram of
one possible environment within a
function named fun x can equal the
string andy whereas in the global
environment x can be the outside x
string we generally represent each of
these environments as a dictionary where
the key is the name of the value and the
value of that entry in the dictionary is
the value of the variable because the
name can be repeated and because a
dictionary has unique keys we're going
to have to have nested dictionaries or
more than one dictionary to easily
represent our environments in theory you
could do it with a single
dictionary but also in theory you can
only use a single flat list for every
program you possibly want to light but
in practice you're going to need
multiple dictionaries the next statement
reads our JavaScript interpreter always
completes after recursively walking the
parse tree this is false the easiest way
to demonstrate this is a little bit of
JavaScript here I have a little bit of
JavaScript that never terminates
although the parse tree for this
javascript is finite interpreting it is
infinite the way we interpret javascript
is by running it and in the process of
running it we're never going to exit
this while loop because the condition is
true so you may ask yourself can our
JavaScript interpreter recognize that
this while loop will never finish and
simply skip it or somehow move on from
it or just terminate early well though
we can tell in this case that the while
loop is never going to exit because it's
true and in no we're inside the loop we
change the control flow in practice and
in theory doing this for the general
case is impossible due to the halting
problem which we discussed in lecture
the last statement states our HTML
interpreter always completes after
recursively walking the parse tree this
is true because no matter what tags we
use there's no notion of a loop like we
have in JavaScript there's no recursive
calls that can cause the HTML
interpretation to take an infinite
amount of time interpreting the HTML is
going to be a direct function of the
number of elements we have in our parse
tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
