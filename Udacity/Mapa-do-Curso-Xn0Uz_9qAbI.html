stages across four lessons in this
course and we'll come back to this
course map periodically to track our
progress in lesson one we're gonna learn
about how to show multiple screens in
your app we're gonna leave the other
screens blank temporarily and dive into
the fundamentals of how Android handles
user touch events in your app so one
lesson two we're gonna display a list of
words in the app will show the English
and MOOC translations for each word and
this involves learning about arrays and
lists which are Java data structures to
store data in our app then in lesson 3
we're going to improve upon the list so
we can show images in the lists
alongside each word once this
functionality works we're gonna make
visual changes color font style spacing
so that the app looks more like the
design mocks we were given in Lesson
four we're gonna add the play icon to
each list item and learn about the media
player in android so we had Android
record record audio files on how to
pronounce each Miwok word so we'll play
each mp3 file when the user clicks on a
list item and at this point we have a
fully functioning app as we mentioned
earlier there are many ways to build
this mean walk language app so we want
to show you another way to modify the
app to have a different navigation flow
in lesson 5 well integrate all four
lists of vocabulary words into a single
activity made of four different
fragments that you can swipe through
there are also tabs across the top and
this is a common pattern and Android
apps that we thought you might find
useful for example the Google Play Store
uses this design when allowing users to
browse through apps so while the focus
of this course is on building a Miwok
language app the skills you learn here
can easily be transferred to any other
app by the end of this course you'll
know how to create an app with multiple
screens display lists of data play audio
files and you'll become more comfortable
with Java oriented programming concepts
these fundamentals will help you build
more complex Android apps with even
better user experiences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
