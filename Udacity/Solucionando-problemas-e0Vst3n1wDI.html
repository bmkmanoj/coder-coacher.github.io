development kit but a few quick notes
before we begin so we've been calling
the Java development kit like a toolbox
and what we mean by that is that the
Java development kit is software that
allows your computer to read and work
with the java programming language this
is sort of fundamentally different than
a software program because it's more
like an upgrade for your computer
so as you're installing the Java
development kit it might seem a little
bit intimidating but what I want to tell
you right now is do not worry about it
you're not going to break your computer
and we're going to go super slowly
through the steps and explain what
you're doing very explicitly as you do
each step that said sometimes students
run into problems so I want to give you
some additional tools to help you
resolve those issues if you do run into
a problem I've got three resources for
you first is the troubleshooting
document linked in the instructor notes
second is the forms in chat where you
can ask fellow students for help I'll be
checking in once in a while to see what
problems students are finding and update
the first document accordingly so if you
do happen to solve a problem consider
posting about your experience of the
forms when you're talking about error it
helps to copy the text of the error you
could also take a screenshot of the
error by using the keys ctrl command
shift on a Mac or the screenshot key on
a Windows machine finally when I run
into errors
I often Google them nine times out of
ten you're going to immediately find
somebody who's run into the exact same
error that you have and by the power of
the Internet a lot of people are going
to have come together and help them
resolve that error so you can follow the
exact same steps that they followed to
resolve your problem now if you're
trying to figure out what to actually
search with my suggestion is to copy the
error message that you're getting and
add a word like Java or Android studio
to the end of it
okay let's dive in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
