someone to help me with a marketing task
and I search for someone on elance and
and he said hey I can do it said okay
let's do it and we started talking we
had our first discovery meeting Scully
phone call and he said like you know
what by the way i also have an R&amp;amp;D
company said really yeah we have like 10
people here and i told him i'm looking
for another L&amp;amp;D company do you think you
can do this project and I was just
walking on my first project with similar
web and he said yeah and since then we
started walking together in in in in
almost everything that I did he became a
part of the company like a heel part of
the company and we became partners
because he understood what I need I
understood what he needs we wanted to
help each other and and our relationship
became so solid that eventually I came
to visit him and to visit his employees
because I wanted to personally know the
people who are walking for us on the
project I wanted them to know that I
kill like I do care one of them just
invited me to his wedding and there are
really great people and I wanted to know
know them more in person because they
are just like employees they just happen
to live far away and and that I was
there for 36 hours but that really
changed everything for us because all of
a sudden it's a real person not an email
not an instant it's not a skype it's not
someone on now slack it's a real person
that you're going and having fun with
went all for drinks and dinner and play
ball and and all of a sudden will part
of the same group that actually meet not
also only work remotely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
