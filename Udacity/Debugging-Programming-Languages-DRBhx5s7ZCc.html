practice with debugging let's say that I
make a mistake there's a bug in my code
so I've introduced a bug in the code and
now let's rerun it no oh this is tricky
output if you look here there is still
one two three four five six seven eight
answers but they're not the right ones
like this LMK ecs sba it's mistakenly
included twice and it should only appear
once as a possibility sba alone once
twice three times four times so here
we're really we're getting the wrong
answer how do we go about debugging it
one of the first steps is to make a test
case that shows the problem and we've
made one but it's kind of big let's see
if we can see the problem with a smaller
test input how about just two people
there should be four possibilities all
different let's see what we get huh we
do get four possibilities but they're
not all different I should get Lucretia
and Elizabeth just Lucretia just
Elizabeth and no one but instead i'm
getting the same thing twice in a row so
even this smaller test case still shows
the bug ok maybe I can make a super
small test case and still see the bug
how about just Lucretia Oh even this
shows the bug because the two answer
should be she shows up and she doesn't
but instead both of the world's I'm
seeing our she shows up so now we have a
very small test case where the output we
observe disagrees with our intuition or
the problem specification now we're
going to go try to localize the bug like
figure out which line the bug is on and
one way to do that is to add print
statements so here I've just added a
print statement for big list and a print
statement for selected so far so that we
can see what's going on with every
recursive call here's a quick quiz for
you how many times do you think we'll
see big list print it out I think it's
going to be three once for the main call
down here and then we'll call ourselves
recursively two more times and then each
one of those will stop and in fact
that's what we get one two three
printings of big list now let's trace
through and see if this matches with our
intuition the big list comes in holding
Lucretia and we haven't selected
anything so far that's good and now we
make two recursive calls the big
list we've pulled off Lucretia okay that
part's correct and selected so far we've
selected Lucretia okay that's possible
remember there are two worlds one where
she accepts our invitation and we select
her one where she doesn't but then as I
looked down here for this next recursive
call the big list is empty again that's
correct because with every recursive
call we have to pull something off it
but selected so far is Lucretia again so
here this is in both world she's invited
our invitation now that's really nice
because we're super popular but it's not
the specification of the problem so it
tells me that for one of these recursive
calls selected so far is being set
incorrectly so now I know the problem is
either here or here I've narrowed it
down to two expressions in two lines
because I know that on the recursive
call selected so far as being set
incorrectly and it's set based on the
value of this second actual argument
alright well let's say I look at this
and I think well I should only be adding
this current element one out of two
times in one world she accepts my
invitation and in ones she doesn't so
let's say over here I'm not supposed to
include current element so let's see if
we're moving it fixes the bug well on
this very simple test case it now works
our answer is sometimes Lucretia shows
up and sometimes she doesn't so we might
be tempted to declare moral victory be
carried through the streets in triumphal
march but let's go back to our other
test cases and make sure that this bug
really fixed the more complicated ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
