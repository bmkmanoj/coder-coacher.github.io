then he became interested in technical
recruiting in the talent field when he
started at Udacity he was our only
recruiter and he now in three and a half
short years has worked his way up into
being the senior recruiting manager next
to Jason is Denise Denise would Taylor
is a recruiter here at Udacity as well
Denise started in the semiconductor
industry
she spent 10 years as a business
operations manager and then pivoted into
the world of talent and recruiting so
she could promote promote careers in
align values to business outcomes next
to Denise's Josh Bernhardt josh is a
Content lead here at Udacity for data
what that means is he develops the
content for the nanodegree so the people
in data and andy josh is the person who
develops that content and actually you
probably recognize him from some of the
videos josh started out as a
biostatistician
for a cancer research start-up he taught
statistics at the University of Colorado
as well as Iowa State University he was
also a coding bootcamp instructor and a
machine learning engineer for a big four
accounting firm and now josh also offers
the perspective of a technical
interviewer because he's often called
upon to do interviews once you reach it
to the interview stage and finally
Jeremy Jeremy cheap fling is a marketing
lead for AI but he is also an amazing
career coach Jeremy has spent his life
basically making students succeeds he
recruited top students to work for Teach
for America he published a top-selling
book on job applications he coached
hundreds of students at the University
of Michigan to achieve their career
goals and he produced the most viewed
video in the history of LinkedIn so this
is our career panel and we we can't wait
to share all of their insights with you
so let's dive right in I think a lot of
questions and thank you to everyone who
submitted questions before we've
consolidated all of those and we'll try
to get to the the crux of what you were
asking I think the most asked question
was how do I get a recruiters attention
so I'll start with you Jason
well how do you get noticed in the sea
of all of the resumes out there and
you're applying for a job how do you get
the recruiters attention everyone thanks
for joining us today
I think this is one of the biggest
common questions in the overall
marketplace as it pertains to recruiting
I don't think there's one right answer I
think just the nature of where
recruiting is at today is that
everything's based on resumes initially
right so you're everything that you have
on your resume is essentially your first
impression to external party so when you
apply to a company you know it's your
first impression so if the entire
company and most for most companies this
is the recruiting team so one of the
biggest tips that I could give you all
is to make sure that you have a well
formatted resume and what I mean by that
is the primary content that I look for
in a resume is just your experience so
for contacts for instance you've
actually just launched this internship
program and every week we're getting
over a thousand resumes for one job and
if you could imagine if only one
recruiters managing just one open wreck
this laws are a lot of resumes to
actually look after so one of these I
would recommend is to highlight all the
different projects that you've worked on
that cater towards what you want to do
in the future
so if I look at your resume I should be
able to see a transition to where you
want to do now and also what you want to
do in the future
so the whole idea is that on paper like
this is Jason and this is who he is if
this is what he wants to do and this is
how I'm gonna get him excited or how I'm
getting a company excited about myself
to the company for this specific role so
Denise who's also a recruiter if you're
that recruiter with the 1,000 resumes
what do you do I think I think a good
starting point is to if you were to tell
your story of what your transition looks
like and
where you're going does that showcase on
your resume you know if there's
technologies that you've been learning
and that you want to move into does it
does it show a transition so if you know
if I were to look at your resume I
should see a story and technical
recruiters technical recruiters know how
to read that story so I would like you
know you should trust that we know what
technologies are what's relatable and
things like that so to be able to
outline that would be a really good
start you know to to be able to say it
out loud like if you were to read your
resume as yeah like a story book what
does that say and how did that
transition to what you want to do now so
that's Jeremy I've heard you talk about
telling that story when you're coaching
people for their profiles can you add
anything to that
yeah so I think let me start by saying
something a little bit controversial
given that the recruiting panel but I'm
the hiring manager up here you may not
want to necessarily catch the recruiters
attention if you're a career changer and
here's why so imagine what Denise and
Jason are up against thousands of
applications for one job and they're
juggling 10 jobs at once 20 jobs at once
and that sort of crowded pool of talent
they don't have time to take a leap of
faith on someone in five seconds or 10
seconds of looking at a resume but if
you can actually find the hiring manager
behind the recruiter the person who
needs to find that one exact perfect
needle in the haystack and forge a
connection with that person you may
actually have more attention more
bandwidth from that person who's on the
other side of the screen so I think the
recruiters are definitely sort of key
gatekeepers and definitely want to work
well with them but also think about the
other folks involved in the hiring
process if that's a good point you
talked about going outside of the
processes is many people have wondered
if recruiters even look at the web
applications now or is it more important
to get a referral or to network what's
your stand point on I'm coming in from
that point and I'll leave it to whoever
wants to grab that one
I think I think it's a combination of
all those different things right it's
it's essentially how can you do your
best to make sure that you have
visibility in a company when you
actually applies to that company so what
it could be maximizing your efforts and
resume it could be networking around to
Jeremy's point here
there's hiring managers there's people
on specific teams so LinkedIn is great
having me right now it's just search
there's tons of people on there I think
there's another my biggest thing is
networking it's also how I made my own
transition to the returning space from
biotech yeah it was big I'm a friend how
I got into the tech space and how I got
into recruiting so one of things that I
would definitely utilize is like meetups
meeting with the entire community
getting a sense of who's in the space
catching up on recent news you know
figure out ways to be more active in the
space and showing that you are super
excited about moving into the space from
your perspective Denise as a recruiter
when you have someone who comes to you
and says I have a referral what how does
that change how you look at that
candidate I mean your odds right now
working applying for the job reach out
directly all those things help you know
gets more attention to you I think that
definitely increases the chances of
looking a little bit deeper at resumes
as well so and if it's a referral from
somebody you know within the company or
a friend of a friend it's a really good
way to be able to vouch for someone you
know I think my transition was
completely different right I was running
operations and production control for a
semiconductor I wanted to get better at
the business development side so I'm
moving to but this biz dev role for a
staffing agency and I realized that my
interest in like operational behaviors
and building teams was more what I
wanted to do in recruiting so then I
moved in transition to recruiting so
even if you like kind of get your
network going and show people that you
know there's
you're making these are the skills that
I'm good at and then kind of make your
way that way sometimes it can be small
steps and sometimes it could be you know
larger steps so that was kind of a yeah
I think there's multiple ways to kind of
get out there and networking is one of
them yeah so I think one of the lessons
I've learned the hardest way trying to
go from being a kindergarten teacher to
working in the tech sector is you get so
caught up in what I'll call sort of the
resume black hole
it's 11:55 at night your retinas are
scarred from looking at indeed and
AngelList and Linkedin you just can't
take it anymore and you're so focused on
the right keyword the right cover letter
the right resume but at the end of the
day remember this people don't hire
cover letters people don't even hire
resumes people hire people and the most
powerful thing about referrals is when a
person comes up to you someone you know
and you trust whether it's Joss or Jason
or Denise or Jane and says I can vouch
for this person this person can come in
and kick butt for that really difficult
job that you need done well guess what
the person with the amazing resume the
beautiful cardstock the incredible
typography on their fonts all that's out
the window because people hire people
good that's a great insight so puts a
face on all of that stack of papers
right so we've alluded to in this
conversation now about the transitioning
careers and moving and I think that
that's a great topic to explore what are
the particular things that you would
recommend are important most most
important to do when you're
transitioning your career and Josh I
know you've come from many different
careers so what was the strategy you use
to get into a good successful career
transition sure so I think it's really
important regardless of what you're
doing in your current role I think it's
really important that if you want to
transition to something new you try to
find ways to like embed that new
component into what you're currently
doing and it shows that you're
interested and it shows that you can
sort of like take this new skill set and
even and especially with what a lot of
you have learned in the programs that
you're doing now it's kind of right like
it's easy to see how if you want to do
data analysis
machine learning or deep learning I
don't know that self-driving cars can be
embedded into every job that you're
currently working at but in a lot of
these other programs there's still
components of self-driving cars that can
be sort of explored in any of the
opportunities you're already doing and
if you're not currently working in some
role then you sort of have the
opportunity to put it wherever your
interests lie before getting that
opportunity but similar to what Denise
was saying earlier they want on a resume
you want to be able to see that that
person is working on projects or doing
things in their current roles that show
that they're looking to transition into
that new opportunity so if you aren't
doing data analysis in your regular role
you're not you're working at a company
that has data but isn't doing machine
learning like taking the extra step to
do it yourself and show that you can do
something cool with it
now gives you something to talk about
with recruiters it gives you something
to talk about in interviews phone
screens anything like that sort of like
open up the door awesome I know Jason
you've talked about this before about
taking that the path making it an
indirect path and starting where you are
right now can you elaborate on that for
the group yeah so to keep things short I
was a researcher at the VA Medical
Center in San Francisco
and decided I wanted to make a change
and at the time I knew a friend I was
thinking about going into sales and at
the time I had a friend that was doing
recruiting and she was like it's a
combination of business development
recruiting people and at the time I was
like hey let's just give it a shot
so I joined a recruiting agency and kind
of built upon my skills for three and a
half years learning all that I can I
networked with a bunch of people
throughout the entire marketplace
meetups learned about different tools
between platforms all those different
things and then over time when internal
a joined Udacity and start off as a
individual contributor and then over
time we've towards management but it was
stepping stones and it was just because
I was just so excited about the people
space that I just wanted to learn
everything that I can
and look at every different platform
medium and soaked it all in and it
worked everything and it's got me to
where I'm at today so you're talking
about passion and authenticity when you
say that it's something you really
believe in how does that come across to
a recruiter when you just see this you
know faceless resume and a thing how do
people effectively communicate that they
have that that passion that's driving
them toward it well I think it was what
he said earlier it's essentially
storytelling right so it's the ability
to create a resume where we get a sense
of what your progression is going to be
right so I'm going through this with my
wife right now
wife's our urban planner for the city of
Santa Clara and she wants to go into
project management at a tech company
so essentially what she's doing now is
she's creating a resume where it all
relates to project management so the
ability to manage different projects
from end to end and essentially if I
were to look at her resume I could see
that she has a progression to become a
project manager and as a recruiter
that's those are the things that we're
looking for when we're actually looking
at resumes is essentially that story
about what you're doing now and where do
you want to end up doing so you bring up
a great point where we were talking
about what to do and what to put on your
resume what are some things you should
leave off of your resume or some things
that you should definitely not include
in a resume that would actually increase
your chances coming back to the story I
think more so if you're going to tell
that story and everything on your resume
should scent be something that you want
to talk about if it's something that's
either not relevant or you're not going
to bring up and probably would leave it
off and kind of transition that resume
into something that tells that better
progression you know if you progress we
also want to look at a progression a
specific job you know if you're raising
the ranks in a specific role or at a
company then we can
see that you're gonna be a really hard
worker or you're gonna move up and then
know that work ethic is one of the
things that we're looking for - so I
think that's what you want to show I
want to focus on what you should show
but yeah I think a lot of times we see
people put things on but they don't want
to talk about and like okay then just
you can leave that off I have a couple
points on what sodid agreeing with some
of the earlier points I don't think the
I think it's important to leave off
things that you either don't want to do
again and you know you don't want to do
again that sort of like lead a company
into believing that you might want to do
that for them or projects that you don't
feel super comfortable with exactly how
it was done because those will get
brought up in your interviews and if you
can't speak to them that looks bad
because if someone else did a similar
project and they can speak to them now
they are going to be you out in the
interview process and you don't want
that happen so a couple of examples of
this are I don't put so if anyone has
used the software called SAS just SAS I
don't put it on my resume I can code in
it but it I don't like it
so I'm don't want recruiters or even
Udacity when they want me to build
nanodegrees aimed at SAS I don't put
that on my resume and I don't sort of
like sell that as one of my useful
skills you won't find it on my LinkedIn
you won't find it anywhere even though I
feel very proficient in and I did for
like three years I just don't want to do
it so I don't put it anywhere on my
profile I have bad news for you Joshua I
think a lot of people know about it now
and and you should know but I don't want
to work but I think there are other
things that they like if you don't so if
you don't want to code in C++ or you're
trying to move into iOS and you were
recently an Android developer or you
want to move out of front-end and into
back-end development like try to sell
yourself on the languages that are tied
to the new skills and the projects that
you've done that go towards the area
that you want unless
on sort of like I have all of these
other things if you don't really want to
stay in that space like it's okay to
have those skills and say yeah I can do
that but if it's not really where you
want to be you don't want to sell that
to the recruiters or anyone so I want to
know how you really feel about SAS I
think going along with this idea of sort
of what doesn't belong on the resume
I'll go back to this concept of everyone
on this stage maybe with the exception
of Josh is a human being josh is like a
from the future to destroy SAS but
basically if we think about the fact
that even in this 21st century we're
here we are this highly evolved species
what has the last year taught us if
anything at the end of the day we're
still fundamentally tribal we have the
sense of affiliation and belonging based
on language and culture and the resume
in some ways becomes an artifact of that
if you send a resume that has all these
acronyms and lingo and vernacular from
your last job but doesn't make any sense
in the new context what are you telling
that recruiter you're saying I belong to
a different tribe
whereas if you can use a language
straight off the job description the
music to their ears that they help
create themselves that says not only am
i part of the tribe but I can leave this
tribe forward I belong then that job is
yours for the taking good messages it
sounds like we're learning to reinforce
here the fact that when you're applying
to a recruiter you're applying to a
person and it's not and keeping in mind
that that connection so transitioning
careers can be many different things
some of the questions that we got were
around the differences between someone
who's just starting out in the career
and how do you get a recruiters
attention when you have zero experience
in this field whether it be zero
experience in this field and experience
in another field or you're just flat-out
starting out how do you how do you
convince a recruiter to take a chance on
you you might not have 100% of the
requirements but you might be the right
person for the job because you can grow
into it so what are the ways you can
demonstrate that
so icon I have worked in the boot camp
space which is frequently people who
don't necessarily have any background
before they start and then try to make
really fast transitions into completely
new careers and so a lot of times those
people's resumes don't look like
anything that's attached to the field
but they're moving into they have you
know between three and six months with
the programming languages that they're
listing and then whatever projects
anyone else from the boot camp has done
they've also sort of complete those
completed those so I think what's really
important when you're making those
transitions and is and something that
you should do even with the nanodegree
process here is to create projects that
are your own that still utilize a lot of
the skills that you picked up but then
you apply again you apply them to some
of your own interests right and you can
do that by reading blogs that other
people have put together by looking
through other people's kit hubs you can
get you can get the ideas for what you
want to build from other places right
and and I think that's even encouraged
especially in tech and in the software
community but it's important that you go
beyond what is sort of required by a
boot camp or by the nanodegree it's
important that that people the people
within that space see that you're
enthusiastic and you have sort of the
drive to go beyond what's required
because that's what they want to see you
do when you get into the job to is they
want to see that you're going to be able
to like do what you're supposed to do
and then like use your interests to sort
of push the boundaries on a lot of
things like the whole culture
so I think for the transition I think
networking is gonna be a really key
factor in that especially because like
we've all talked about you know having
that referral and having someone vouch
for you and regardless if it's like this
person which is a really hard worker and
they're gonna be able to ramp up in six
months it might take you six months to
find a machine-learning engineer you
know like maybe we should just take the
time and develop this person so I think
there's a lot of meetups you can start a
blog just really showcase your work and
show that you're going above and beyond
to to make this move you know it's it's
not an easy transition and either you
take those small steps who are like
you'll if you're going from Harvard or
software you know you you go join a
company that does both and you see if
you can take on some projects that you
know transition you know software and
then finally finally move this offer so
I think there's a lot of different ways
but networking and getting people to
speak on your behalf and pass your
resume on or even just introduce you to
be able to tell your story in person and
rather than on paper is gonna be one of
the key things are there effective ways
along those lines to show trans skills
that transfer so similar skills like I
may have done I might not have done
exactly what you're looking for but I've
done this and also what how important
what do you think soft skills are so
showing that you have the ability to
learn or what are some of the skills
that that attract your attention in that
case Jason I think this ties in to what
Josh and Denise we're talking about
especially going above and beyond what
you're doing now so so time and again I
always speak with some people that have
learn new skills and then it's at a halt
and now they're looking for a job and
they spend the next six months to a year
looking for a job hopefully does it take
that long but the idea is that continue
on with your passion like you should be
going into a space where you're super
excited to want to learn and want to be
in this area so large you said reiax web
developers self-driving car machine
learning
those are all the areas that you should
continue to build upon after the and
those are ultimately ones that sort of
succeed it's showing that level of
passion and motivation to continue on in
this base and how you do that is by
showcasing your projects on paper so
it's a combination of two things one is
on on paper it says your resume so on
your resume should be able to showcase
in various different projects that you
worked on new like features that you
develop on top of your existing like you
had to be capstone projects anything
that showcases that you're stupid
excited about this advice and then on
the other hand you know when you
actually do have that a phone
conversation with anyone with an ax
company being able to tell that story
right like hey I started in here but
these are all the different types of
projects that I've been doing and this
is what I want to do in the future so on
both sides it's the ability it's really
showcase that you're super excited and
you're super motivated about the career
that you want to move into so how do you
do that for people who have taken a
let's say along maybe a pause from their
career or they have been out of work for
a while and you have that dreaded gap on
your resume so how does a recruiter
really feel about seeing a gap on a
resume or seeing a super short work
stint like maybe you maybe you started a
job and it wasn't a good fit so should
you just leave that off or what what
what is the real insider story on gaps
and short stints that's a tough question
I think everyone has their own
perspective of short stints long stance
gaps I think like what we talked earlier
it's essentially showcasing that you're
doing things within that gap right so
let's say you have a gear gap and if it
was a year gap you're doing nothing
that's pretty hard to explain see you a
recruiter or a hiring manager as soon as
you get on the phone with them but I
think showcasing that you've done
something within that gap either three
months six months whatever it is we're
going to go a long way
and for people that have short stints I
think everyone has a reason why they've
left a company joined a company whatever
reason it is but being also being able
to tell that story right I think I've
had multiple conversation is doing this
for the past seven years now and there
are some individuals that tend to
highlights all the negative stuff that
has happened but I think in turn what we
should do is to highlight the positives
right like this is what happened at a
previous company and this is what I
learned from it and this is what I want
to get out of my next opportunity so I
think there's ways to tell your story
and various different opportunities
either in your previous company in your
gap or you know whatever is on your
resume awesome the theme of the story
keeps coming through here and it's a
good one because it harkens back to
Jeremy's come in at about people being
humans and I think relating to each
other in a way where you really are just
I mean you're going to work with these
people right so you want to be with
someone that you can work on a team
together with awesome
so in in light of the fact that people
are maybe taking a break and then coming
from a space where they've done
something else is there a specific way
that they should frame experience that
maybe isn't paid like how do you feel
about people including work like that in
their experience where they may had have
volunteered or done something do you
consider that equivalent to paid
experience or is that something that
they should treat in a different way
yeah when I worked at LinkedIn we
actually commissioned the study of
recruiters just on this very topic it
turned out that 40% of recruiters at
least in the US see volunteer work as on
par or even better than paid work so I
think you're doing something that you're
really proud of and going back the idea
of values infusing your passions what
you do not just filling your time and I
think you should definitely showcase
that on your resume on your LinkedIn
profile in the interview your that's
gonna come across it's just as important
just as dynamic as anything you do day
to day some of that theme that I'm
hearing - that is authenticity so if if
what you're your story is authentic if
what you've done aligns with what you
say you want to do are there any key
signals that make a resume stand out to
you that it's an authentic person for me
like I you know I think it's very
specific to recruiters but I think in
general to highlight you know your
accomplishments in a way that's direct
rather than I guess you know embellished
you can kind of tell sometimes when
resumes are embellished so I think that
really like I said when you tell your
story and if you feel comfortable saying
it out loud and telling it in a way that
makes you feel like okay this is
actually what I've done and I know that
this is what I want to work towards I
think that's kind of way that you should
show it on your resume Tasha had
something yeah so I don't know about
I personally don't look at a lot of
resumes so but I do know going to
Jason's point from earlier I think that
in person there's a lot to be said about
taking every experience that you have
and putting it in a positive light or at
least a learning experience and a lot of
that can be shown in terms of like
culture and authenticity so maybe not
like project based but so even if you
have like a negative work experience in
terms of like oh I found out that this
wasn't a very good fit for me or I
didn't actually like the work that I was
doing or that you know the that the
group that I was working with wasn't
something that I was super excited about
being able to put the right light on
that and like why the next thing or why
this new thing that you're looking at is
better fit and what it has that your
current opportunity doesn't and while
you're excited about working with that
group and doing the things that they're
working on is is a better putting that
spin on it is like the way that you
should go about doing it I think
something in terms of Austin whether its
authenticity or just the way that you
word things and how you fit in with
people if you put negative spins on all
the things that you're sort of like
currently doing and saying like oh I
don't like this about what I'm doing and
I really don't want to do this anymore
so like if I went into my job interviews
and I was like I'm working in SAS and
it's terrible and I don't want to do it
anymore like people would be like oh we
don't want to hire this guy he's just
gonna pick up the next coding language
and he's gonna hate that and then we're
gonna have to like watch him move on to
something different but instead I say oh
you know what I'm you know I'm I picked
up C++ and I'm doing this thing with
self-driving cars and check out this
cool you know virtual car environment
simulator that I'm working in using
unity something like that would be
something that shows that you're
interested in a new field and while
you're moving that direction and less of
I really don't like what I'm doing now
and so I think there's like you can see
authenticity and like putting a positive
light on what you're working on and it
shows a cultural fit and as somebody
that other people want to work with
right like they don't want people don't
want to work with somebody who's just
gonna be negative about everything that
they're doing we know that there are
positives and negatives of every day in
work let me actually offer a simple test
to help you figure out if you're
applying for the right kind of jobs so
some folks were saying during the
introductions
they've been applying and applying and
applying and they're never getting past
the phone screen they're never getting
past that first contact with recruiters
this is the what question you want to
ask yourself why are you applying for
this job when I was coaching at the
University of Michigan I kid you not I
would be doing these practice interviews
and I would say okay
why do you under work at Amazon why do
you want to work at Google why do you
want to work at Microsoft and the
students would say timeout what's the
right answer
if you can't answer that question if you
don't know why you're in that room or in
the process to begin with then maybe
that's not the right job for you
because ultimately that's going to come
out in the process that sense of
authenticity or lack thereof and if you
can't muster that at the application
stage there's no way you're gonna do it
an interview number five at 4:30 in the
afternoon so definitely ask yourself
that question up front and leave with
that authenticity lead with that passion
sorry adding to that yes so just going
off of Jeremy's point I think so when I
applied to Udacity and went through the
whole process here it was kind of like I
see what you're doing in the education
space I want to be a part of this I've
been in education for a long time I see
like good and bad things about what I'm
currently doing in education but I think
you guys are doing a lot of things right
I want to be a part of it I want to help
move the needle on what you're working
on and so I imagine that that was a
benefit of why I got hired here but in
general like if you are going to look at
Google or Amazon and you're like oh I
want to work here because I hear you
have good benefits and you get good
stock options and I want to stay in
Seattle right like those lots of people
can feel that way but you should be like
oh I see that you're doing this thing
and I'm interested in the space I see
you're using these tools I want to do
stuff with that right like it's my dream
to serve ads to people I don't like
whatever you want to do but like you
should have some level of authenticity
on whatever job you're applying to but
you're also showing a focus toward the
company so that I want to live here I
want to do this as very me focused and
it sounds like what you're saying is put
that focus on how you can contribute to
the company and why it's in their best
interest to hire you what you'll bring
to the table
I wanted to pivot off of your comment on
processed geremy and take a moment to
talk a little more about the actual
hiring process here in the recruiting
process so people get a sense of what
you think add in the different steps so
you talked about distinguishing yourself
what are some things that people should
definitely not do because I'm guessing
that when you have a thousand resumes
the last thing you want is for every
single person to call you instead so
what are some things that people should
definitely not do to stand out in the
recruiting process that make your life
more difficult
I want to highlight you know what you
should do I think one thing that I can
contribute you know to say is you know a
lot of people reach out on LinkedIn to
me I'm happy to you know add people I
think the network is definitely
necessary and helpful for this industry
to reach out be like I'm XYZ where can I
fit in your company you know I think
going to the case like why do I don't
want to work at Udacity what role fits
what I want to do and make sense as my
next step you know apply for that role
and then reach out I apply for this role
can you please take a look at my resume
and then we can go through the thousand
and pick out yours and look specifically
like oh this person went above and
beyond and reached out to me and asked
and if anything we can at least point
you in the right direction so that's
what Jason you have any don't these are
all some of the things that we covered
additionally spin everything in a good
light everything's a learning point stay
positive some other things are - what
Josh was talking about is essentially
one aspect is essentially the technical
skills right do you match all the things
that we're working on in terms of our
sexed tech stack our projects and all
that good stuff on the other side it's
team fit culture fits collaboration and
a large part of how I cage that is
passion
so when Josh was talking about being
excited to apply for a company you don't
know how many times I asked okay it's
like hey why did you apply to or why are
you so excited to apply to Udacity and
the answer is I just I just applied it
one company that I applied to so it's
like definitely avoid those answers I
think having a legitimate reason as to
why you're applying to a company and how
it pertains to your skill sets and your
career move I think what's often go a
long way
what about the cover letter a lot of
there's a lot of back-and-forth
controversy about whether you need a
cover letter anymore whether the cover
letter should be directed to a specific
person how do you feel about that
might be the wrong person ask I'm
actually not a fan of cover letters the
reason being is because when you think
about recruiting and all the interviews
or all the resumes that we're getting
it's hard to view two different
documents for every single person but
there's a caveat to that where if you
are you know fresh out of school I think
developing some search story about what
you want to get into could potentially
go a long way but as you get as you move
up you know become a mid-level engineer
or a c-level engineer I think by that
it's everything based on paper or you
know the referral or your interactions
with someone in the company anyone else
have a cover letter I would say probably
to mimic Jason oh no for both on that
same page but I think a better reach out
would be a quick one or two lines to the
recruiter or to highlight like in your
summary of your LinkedIn profile of you
know what you want to do kind of what
you're looking for next I think that
would be a good way to go about it as
well especially when we know one cover
let we can tell sometimes when cover
letters are a template so kind of a one
or two lines just like I really excited
about Udacity because XYZ even helpful
have you guys ever got in a cover letter
addressed to Coursera Oh be careful no
fine to replace that's a bad moment
right so um people talk about tailoring
their resumes and not just having like
one resume do you think that that's an
important thing to do so talking to the
idea of the template Jeremy how
important is it to create a resume that
is specifically tailored to the job you
want instead of what what's all about
you yeah I'd be curious here with the
recruiters have to think about this my
sense is you probably want to have at
least one resume per function that you
apply for so if you're applying for like
three different kinds of jobs that are
fundamentally different again speak the
language of each individual job don't
waste a single pixel single drop of ink
on that page when you could be a hundred
percent laser focus I'm a thing that the
recruiter wants to find that being said
the other thing I would recommend about
resumes is don't make them cookie cutter
don't tear tear down all the things that
make you unique whether it's your
hobbies or your areas of individuality
like if you could just see what this
cafeteria had looked like six hours ago
we were having lunch today the reason
that Tech is so awesome
it's because Tech represents the world
we've got people from all over the world
people with pink hair multiple piercings
they're not here because they were
cookie cutter candidates because they
conform to someone's vision of who they
should be they're here because they had
something you need to contribute and if
you have that let that fly let that on
your resume that's your chance show it
off
speaking of standing out how do you
compare candidates with very similar
experience and let's say you're you know
looking for a role and a lot of the
resumes you're seeing they have similar
experience they have similar skills and
they all kind of look the same what are
the things that jump out to you that say
okay maybe this this this gets moved to
the next step Josh wants to take it I
see the microphone going up yes so I
think that's experience right you look
for say a sixth it's just gonna keep
coming up so I think something that has
come up again and again and this might
be sort of like shifting around a good
answer for this but one thing that keeps
coming up is networking and how
important that is
yeah so regardless of what you look like
on paper I think that it's super
important whether you reach out to a
recruiter or you can find a hiring
manager or just somebody internal to the
company who might be related to a job
that you're applying for right like it's
important it's internally important for
that company to fill certain positions
because it helps them meet whatever
internal goals they have for the company
like it's important to understand that
they want to find good people to help
benefit their company and their company
goals and so the advantages of sort of
being able to stand out and show that
you're gonna go the extra mile and reach
out and network to people or even find a
link of a link on LinkedIn or something
like that like someone who's connected
through the grapevine and say
hey you know I actually worked with this
person I noticed that you're connected
to them do you actually know them I did
X Y &amp;amp; Z with them if you noticed that
they like work for the same company or
something like that I think that any
chance you can get to sort of like form
a human human connection can help you
stand out above a piece of paper when
you might look like a lot of other
candidates who are applying I would like
to you know think that if a resume was
identical we would talk to both so I
think it's your chance then to really
communicate to that recruiter or pairing
manager you know sometimes hiring
managers get on the phone right away to
showcase that I think a lot of times -
the assumption is I I gave you my resume
you should see what I do but when we ask
you you know tell me a little bit more
walk me through your resume we want to
understand your communication style if
you're gonna be joining a team then you
should be able to talk about what you're
working on so that's kind of one of the
things that I look for as well awesome
we wanted to save some time for you to
ask questions of this group as well so
before we do that does anyone have any
closing thoughts they'd like to leave
before we move to the Q&amp;amp;A section ready
to take down the questions okay let's go
any does anyone have a question for the
group we have a to really do you have
the question Bob oh oh that's higher
okay perfect
okay okay so the question was if I have
three different resumes for three
different positions how do i reconcile
that what should I do with my LinkedIn
profile so uh I think that your job
title should definitely match your
LinkedIn I think we do check you know
that your story on your LinkedIn profile
matches your resume on LinkedIn probably
highlight more of a summary level of
each role and then on your resume have
specific bullet points of what you're
doing that tells a story of what you're
you want to do next you know every job
has a hundred different tasks or things
that you work on so just pick those ones
and tell that story for that specific
job you would apply for yeah I totally
agree with that especially if you're
really torn between those three
different roles however if you're like
wow I really want to go for this one
this is my premier sort of top of the
totem pole role and the other ones are
sort of plans B and Plan C do the
Silicon Valley thing a be tested take
your LinkedIn profile change the
headline change in summary make sure
it's totally focused around the thing
that you want and see how many profile
reviews you get specifically how many
recruit reviews do you get if you're
getting way more for that then for your
plan B role and maybe you're in the
right case where if it's the other way
around
maybe it's time to rethink things what
do speak very technically good approach
did you go question Jason my are the not
sure if the three roles are similar but
I would really think about your next
career move so if it's wait if it's
three different roles I would take a
step back and really think about what is
your next career move and then cater
your entire profile to that specific
role I think it's really hard because I
would imagine if it's three separate
roles you're integrating with three
different mindsets if you are getting
phone interviews with different
companies and that's pretty hard to
manage and also goes back to motivation
and passion right can you stay motivated
and stay passionate and tell your story
for all three different positions at any
given company so I think I might be
easier just to prioritize and really
figure out you know what you want to do
for your next career move and target
that and spend all your efforts for that
one specific role yes how can I get a
feedback from the hiring manager my
situation basically is I have the
quarter for Utah City with this self
driving and so I have no seems I have no
problem of attracting recruiters
attention almost every week I custom
call and no problem but most of my
interview is stopped at hiring managers
the phone interview and it's very hard
to get the feedback of course you can
see that the problem and have too much
experience probably what they to be told
and as a matter of fact yesterday
receiver exactly what pre-pack said
you're perfect except that you are too
old
oh wow that's that's pretty harsh
feedback what's besides they
so the question was how do I get
feedback from the hiring managers when I
don't move on and I'm not grading past
like the phone interview and not getting
a sense of why I'm not getting called
back I would say you know typically you
ask the recruiter to get more feedback
this should be able to get that at least
some additional feedback and reasons how
to afford you know so go through the
recruiter to get a sense of if you have
direct contact with your hiring manager
then you can ask them directly but
usually you have contacted the recruiter
and they can find out a little bit more
information for you
you know sometimes - it's just timing
and it's also specific skillsets and and
I think that keeping in contact and in
that network maybe you're not a fit
right now but in the there might be
another job opening soon so I I wouldn't
count it out if you are getting rejected
try to like reach out again I don't
think it's sometimes just a timing thing
and perhaps the way you ask that for
that feedback would make a difference as
well if you ask it in a way where you're
looking to learn for the next instead of
I mean some people don't like to deliver
bad news so perhaps if you ask the
question in a way that makes it easy for
them to help you learn and grow you
might get more of a response I mean I
know I only do things with technical
interviews for the most part I imagine
if someone reached out to the recruiter
and they failed because of a technical
component and they wanted feedback I
would be happy to sort of say you know
when you were going through this like
there were some errors here this would
have this wouldn't have compiled right
this there were some syntax I mean like
it depends on how granular you really
want to get and what actually matters in
a coding interview is you know a little
different I think also maybe you want to
highlight what you want to do next or
you know if you're the perfect fit but
you want to do you want to see your
progression - right most times when
you're hiring somebody we want to hire
someone that will grow
with the team as well so I think maybe
focusing on that too not just what I'm
doing now but this is what I want to do
this is what I'm doing to learn that I
think that's just the same story for for
most applicants and the other question
sure so the question was how do I
present a wealth of experience and soft
skills and experience in another field
without disadvantaging yourself against
perhaps an age bias that might be
introduced by showing you have this lots
of experience I think I think it's
pretty tough right because it's based on
company to company and that bias is
always going to be there I think some
things that you could do is Jeremy's
come in earlier do some a/b testing
rights how much information do you have
on your resume is it from way back when
and all the different experiences that
you gone through or is it you know just
things that are most relevant that are
on one page I think that could
definitely help I'm just trying to think
out loud right now essentially taking
out some information like ears in terms
of Education
I think of different options is that is
that a flag though if you leave the
dates off or the years off that's hard
to say because I don't look any new is
that that stuff the primary thing that I
look at is current company and the
responsibilities that you have and the
things that you have done as well as the
projects to me that's the only thing
that matters so make those super
compelling and they won't notice the
rest so I will repeat that because it's
wonderful news Giovanni wanted to say
that he used the resume service through
Udacity did the resume project and it
was tremendously helpful so any of you
here and anyone listening who has not
done it yet
visit the career portal get into the
classroom and submit that resume review
project don't waste that opportunity you
get literally a person looking at your
resume a career counselor who has
experience who will give you feedback on
how to do all of the things we're
talking about here and that is how to
tailor that resume to fit and you can
even give them a job description so you
can say I'm looking to apply to this job
exactly so part of it is to show how do
I tailor my resume to put my best foot
forward for this role yeah absolutely I
think I was going to mention that
Udacity is really a cool player in the
space because we're like the Switzerland
of interviewing will give you that
candid feedback without fear of getting
sued as well as often the case with
these recruiters as you can see why and
so I would say is think about using
LinkedIn in the other direction so often
it's about find the recruiter or find
the hiring manage or try to get your
foot in the door also try to figure out
do you really want to be there if a
company is telling you that you're too
old to work there is that a job that you
want that a culture you want to be in
check out who makes up the leadership of
that company do you feel like they're
gonna represent your values if not there
are other jobs in the sea I was actually
gonna say that was I was gonna say you
know you're also interviewing the
company and seeing if this is where you
want to move if you're gonna do all of
this work to make a transition in your
career then you should probably make
sure that it's the right move you know
you don't want to do all this work and
that comes go somewhere and be like this
is really bad and then be really sour
about it so I think that's a big sign
like that's not where I want to be any
other questions
oh I'm sorry I'm very strong core
services not there I wanted to move for
example mission burning very strong are
the core services of Maison is it ok to
mention like you know this is where I
wanted to see myself in the future and
like Anna knows what my strength is
right now that is my first question
and second question if I interviewed
with the company two years before how to
remove that for example I didn't have
that experience right but like if I'm
applying for the same role again
recruiters always referred to that
particular whatever it was like the
ancient me right now they go back like
hey you know what let you not know
that's not me so there were two
questions here the first question was if
I have not a hundred percent of the
skills that they're looking for and
there's a Delta between what I have but
I aspire to be somewhere that is closer
to should you acknowledge it and how do
you deal with that on the application
and the second part is if there's
something in your past that you've done
that you don't want to focus on but
people keep going back to look at it how
do you turn them back from focusing on
something that you've done maybe two
years ago that's not related to where
you want to be headed with the new I
equal to 1 to N they keep going
they don't just oh so you're going back
to the same company so he's saying if
you reapply to a company you apply two
years ago for the same role have
developed in two years and then you
reapply and they still see you back as a
time warp how you were two years before
and don't see the progression cool other
cooter speak to how do you create
amnesia in the recruiters as far as the
first question goes I think this speaks
to like what the resume should be for
you which is this living and breathing
document that represents where you're
headed your aspirations and ambitions
not just a static view of where you were
in the past if that was the case Josh
you'll still be at the University of
Colorado I'd still be a kindergarten
teacher we'd all be stuck in the past
and that's certainly not the case that
you want to project out there for the
for the recruiting audience I think the
way that you tackle that is exactly why
you're all in this room right now which
is that you're working to make yourself
better day in and day out list that name
review with pride list of projects that
you completed list the skills that you
accumulated even if you're not a master
yet of each one of those I think showing
that you're moving in the direction
there's dynamism in your life and not
just sort of the static inert candidate
that's what people are hungry for that's
what they want I think I think that's
another question for you to be like is
that somewhere I want to go or they're
not dynamic enough to see that there's
progression between two years or four
years and then also to go back and if
you still have those contacts that you
interviewed with the first time to go
back and like I've done all these things
I'm taking these courses I'm in Crete I
you know I've gotten better than these
specific things and I applied for this
role again can you please reconsider me
I think that would be a helpful way to
be like I know I applied before I I know
you know you can see it I can see it we
I apply before and this is why I'm ready
now
which gets back to that authenticity we
talked about before right just own it
and say acknowledge to awesome I think
we have time for one or two more
questions
have too many chocolates I had one
coming for a single company what should
I do
the kind of objection well let's take
once what was it if you have too many
targets you just self-driving so we can
get more internal connection rather than
so I can answer the second question and
then we'll go to this so the second
question is is there a platform to
connect on in the answer is yes that's
what we're our alumni network is for you
can connect on LinkedIn you can connect
on slack and you can connect on the new
Facebook root that we've created and you
can leverage yourselves to network and
talk about jobs there is a job postings
channel on the linked on the on the
slack Network where you can share jobs
with other alumni so please join them as
an alum we want to have you we we love
to have you and we'd like to get your
feedback and then this first question
was what if I have only one target and
not many how do I really optimize my
chances putting everything in that one
basket because that's the real job I
want I would say that your network is
gonna be a key piece there I think you
can find people that could introduce you
to somebody
Tally's I got this advice early in my
career that leaders loved sharing their
story and helping you know people grow
and develop so if you were to reach out
to someone really I really want to learn
how I can become part of your team
a lot of the cases they might be able to
be like yeah I'm happy to share or
especially if you know somebody that
could introduce you to that person right
like my friend really wants to learn how
to become you know software engineer
he's had all this experience can you
just have lunch with him I think that's
a really good way to target that company
and you know like if you're all like
certain one is asking you really want to
go gung-ho just be really persistent
about that
so on that note the networking piece of
that is what we're going to do next
we're out of time for this however I
think our panelists can still stick
around a bit so if you have questions
that you'd like to ask them directly I
would encourage you though to also ask
questions of each other and see what
you've all learned out of this and start
to make your connections because you
never know the person sitting next to
you may know someone who works at that
one job that you really want to work at
there might be someone in this room who
now has a friend who works at that
company who could make the connection
for you so we know we do know some
people who work there so I just want to
thank again Jeremy Josh Denise and Jason
for an outstanding job thank you it's
been really great and thank you all for
sharing your questions and being honest
it's hard to talk about some of these
things but I think you've done a great
job and have some food have some
conversation and let the conversations
continue here thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
