description talks about implementation
the design pattern that we've understood
so far has to do with the design of a
solution not necessarily its
implementation implementation means
translating that design into some code
okay doing that often means that their
choices arise and it's important to
understand the implications of those
choices the implementation section of a
design pattern description lays out
those implementation issues and
alternative ways of addressing them for
the composite pattern here are some of
the issues that arise we know that in
the pattern so far we have references
from parents to children an issue that
you might wish to include or a feature
you might wish to include is do you have
pointers from children back to parents
want you to do this of course
referential integrity problems might
arise another issue is whether we would
allow multiple parents to refer to the
same children imagine that you have
separate hierarchies in which the leaf
elements are shared this of course can
be powerful if you wish to do it because
it reduces the overall number of objects
that you have but it might also increase
your code complexity if you were to do
that similar to the situation where we
just described in which moving the add
operation up in the hierarchy has the
benefit of making the unity interface
more uniform however it might lead to
having unnatural operations at too high
a level in the hierarchy similarly
placing the list of children up one
level also would mean that somehow now
Leafs had children another issue is what
data structure should you use to keep
the list of children there are hash
tables there are raised linked lists and
so on finally is the question of whether
when you delete a composite do you also
delete its children</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
