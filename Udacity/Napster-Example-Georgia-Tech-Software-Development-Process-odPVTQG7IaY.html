its first incarnation Napster was a
peer-to-peer file sharing system and it
was mostly used actually to illegally
share mp3s which is also the reason why
it gets sued and later on it basically
ceased operations but nevertheless I
think Napster is an interesting example
of mixed architecture and I'm going to
illustrate the way Napster works by
showing you here the basic configuration
of Napster and the interactions between
its elements so let's look at how such
interaction can take place for the three
peers shown here and in this case a peer
a and B are the only ones really
involved in the action so let's look at
a typical sequence of events for the
Napster system we have peer a that we'll
start by registering here with the
content directory peer B will also
register with the content directory and
when these two peers registered the
content directory will know what kind of
content they can provide later on peer a
will request a song and one first
observation that we can make based on
this interaction is the fact that up to
now this is a purely client-server
system this is the client this is the
client and this is the server and the
interaction is a typical client-server
interaction but now we're at the point
in which things start to change a little
bit at this point after peer a has
requested the Sangha the peer and
content directory will look up its
gigantic index and we'll see that peer B
actually has the song that peer a
requested so it will send to peer a a
handle that peer a can use to connect
directly to peer B so this is where the
system is not longer a client-server
system because at this point the two
peers are connected directly so at this
point we have a peer to peer interaction
and after getting the request from peer
a then peer B will start sending the
content to pure a and I said earlier
that one of the useful things about
representing an architecture and the
interactions within an architecture
graphically is the fact that it allows
you to spot possible problems and in
this case by representing the Napster
architecture in this way and by studying
how things work we can see that there's
an issue with the architecture of
Napster they will not make this
architectural scale as some of you might
have already noticed this peer and
content directory is a single point of
failure and is
very likely to cause problems when the
number of peers grows too large because
at that point there's going to be too
many requests to the peering content
directory and the peering content
directory is unlikely to be able to keep
up with all the requests so some changes
in the architecture will have to be made
in the case of Napster we didn't see
this problem occurring because as I said
earlier Napster got sued and ceased
operation before the problem actually
manifested now looking at the system
from an architectural style perspective
we can see that Nestor was a hybrid
architecture with both client-server and
peer-to-peer element and something I
would like to stress here is that this
is not at all uncommon so in real-world
and non-trivial architectures it is very
common to see multiple styles used in
the same system the next instant that we
will consider Skype is instead an
example of a well design almost purely
peer-to-peer system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
