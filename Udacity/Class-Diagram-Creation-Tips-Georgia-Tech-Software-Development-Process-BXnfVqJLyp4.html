about class diagrams is some creation
tips so something a new based on my
experience and the experience of others
I can recommend to do when creating a
class diagram so the first tip is to
understand the problem so take the time
to look at the description of the system
that you have to build to make sure that
you understand the domain that you
understand what you're supposed to build
because that is going to save you time
later it's going to help you identify
from the beginning and more relevant set
of entities in the description of the
system this one might seem trivial but
it's very important to choose good class
names
why because class name communicate the
intent of the class and clarify what the
class refers to so having good class
name allows you makes it easier to
create a mapping between the real world
object and the entities in your model
and of course it also makes it easier to
understand the system after the system
is built fur tip concentrate on the what
so here in the class diagram we're just
representing the structure of the system
we're representing what is in the system
what are the entities what are the
characteristics of the entities we're
not focusing at all on how things are
done so be careful don't think about how
just think about the what proceeding in
an iterative way so start with a simple
diagram and refine it so there is no
need to identify right away all of the
details of the system the chef to build
it is much easier to look at the
description identify an initial graph
plus diagram and then refine it because
in this way you'll also gather more
understanding of the system as you build
it and you'll most likely end up with a
better product at the end and if you
proceed in this way then make sure to
refine until you feel the class diagram
is complete until you feel that you
represent the system that you're
supposed to build so your final goal
should be to have a class diagram that
is complete so it represents all of the
relevant entities in the system and
their characteristics and it's correct
so it represents it in the right way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
