instructor and welcome the coffee break
today we have Steve Hoffman and Steve
Hoffman taught CS 253 which is our web
development class and he's also founded
a couple companies Reddit and Hipmunk
and so we're gonna listen to a little
bit of career advice from Steve so Steve
you've hired some people you have some
companies what advice do you what are
you looking for when you're hiring
software engineers so when we hire
engineers we look for basically two main
qualities the first thing I think is the
easiest to gauge which is can you
program we usually start off with a
programming exercise you know I very
actually I'd limit a cast epoch when we
receive resumes actually the cover
letter is literally the most important
thing you can send to me because we want
to hire people who want to work with us
and if I don't say that then we do not
proceed and so once I've determined they
want to work with us I don't actually
look too closely at the resume I want to
see can they program so I usually give
them a programming assignment and it's
usually you know put a basic you know
web application online that does X
nothing too complicated but that gives
us a chance to see you know can they
follow simple instructions will they set
my expectations will they actually
follow through with this all sorts of
handy little kind of real worlds you
know equivalent things and if they do a
good job on that we'll bring them in for
an interview and from there it's some
light programming stuff but at that
point I've already seen a chunk of their
code and talked to them about it
from there it's mostly just screening
you know are you a jerk like do you fit
in are you are you highly like high self
confident you know do you I'm kind of
looking I'm looking for the absence of
like these negative traits I see a lot
in developers but if you don't want to
hire people who are territorial
we don't know hire people who are
condescending or like when I interrupt
you in an interview do you like just
keep going or do you actually eat you
get like bristly and like that sort of
thing those are sorts of things are
looking for and then from there we can
usually actually make a pretty good
decision I think so I have no formal
education in computer science they've
taken our introductory computer program
glass but what what advice to have for
someone like me someone who doesn't have
that background is looking to get into
the world of software engineering the
simplest advice is write a lot of code
it's work on as many projects as you can
so I think experience Trump's anything
else and you'll start to develop a taste
for good code for bad code and you know
you'll you'll start to see the same
problems over and over and over again
just like in any career right experience
is all that matters what's nice about
programming is the raw materials are
basically free you don't you know all
you need is computer time but you don't
need like physical things to build
whatever it is you're building so you
know learn as many you know different
concepts as possible you know through
things like Udacity or you know any of
the other information online and then
just write software write as much as you
can
and you'll get better very fast and
certainly when you're applying to you
know if you were playing to work at at
Hipmunk or that's that sort of thing
whether or not you have a formal CS
education is not important we just try
to find people who behave as though they
have a formal CS education and actually
the many of our employees don't have a
formal CS education but they're very
good programmers and they know the
vocabulary and they know how to you know
work in that ecosystem exactly that's
easier said than done okay so in your
mind what skills are what do you need to
see to believe that someone is not just
a good engineer but a great engineer
what separates makes a distinction so I
think a good engineer in my mind can
write anything but a great engineer can
write something that not only works but
is maintainable is clear and solves
other problems our best engineers at
Hipmunk they improve our process there
are very good code reviewers and their
code is you know it's one of the things
you don't get to practice very much when
you're in a school setting or a learning
setting is writing for the future
because you write your code once and
then six months later you don't even you
don't even remember it but when you're
working for a company when you're
working for on a real project you
you're gonna have to come back to that
coat again and again and again so making
sure that things are named properly are
organized properly our performance so
that like you or the next guy who's
inheriting this code actually knows
what's going on that I think is the it's
much more of an art than a thinness just
that you know something you can just
kind of learn from it from from you know
a class or something like that just
takes experience but great engineers do
that they're thinking about kind of a
broader picture of the context in which
they're writing code and it's it's
tricky but that's I think that's where a
lot of the real value is okay right
thanks a lot sure it was really great
