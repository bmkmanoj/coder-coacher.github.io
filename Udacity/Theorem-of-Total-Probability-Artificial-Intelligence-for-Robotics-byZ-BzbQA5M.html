out to be something we would call total
probability you remember that we cared
about a grid cell X I and we asked what
is the chances of being x I after of
overt motion now to indicate the
afternoon before let me add a time index
so T up here is an index for time and I
write an upper cap so as no confusion
with the index I which is the grid cell
you might remember the way we computed
this was by looking at all the grid
cells the board could have come from one
time step earlier in next year by J we
looked at the prior probability of those
grid cells at time t minus 1 and we
multiplied with the probability that our
motion command would carry us from XJ to
X I that's written as a conditional
distribution as follows so this was
exactly what we implemented if there was
all Witt cells over here and we asked
one time step later about a specific red
cell over here we would combine point
eight from over here point one from over
here and point one from over here into
the probability of this grid cell it's
the same formula as here this is now X I
and the way we find the posterior
probability for X I is to go through all
possible places from which we could have
come all the different rays look at the
prior probabilities multiply it by the
probability that I transition from J to
I give my motion command which in this
case is go one to the right side now in
probability terms people often write it
as follows P of a equals some of our be
P of a given B times P of B this is just
the way you'd find it in textbooks and
you can see directly the correspondence
of a as a place I at time T and all the
different B's as the possible prior
locations that is often called the
theorem of total probability and the
operation of a weighted sum over other
variables is often called a convolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
