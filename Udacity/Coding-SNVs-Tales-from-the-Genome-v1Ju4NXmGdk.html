likely to cause problems than non-coding
snv's because there's more of a risk of
changing the amino acid sequence of
proteins which is going to alter their
function for example take this sequence
from the ABO gene that determines blood
type we talked about this gene in lesson
3 now if this particular sequence were
transcribed and translated starting
right here at the start codon region atg
based on the genetic code that we
learned about previously in lesson 3 we
would obtain a protein sequence of
methionine valine arginine valine valine
and threonine we got this by essentially
dividing our sequence up into codons
that we could read with our genetic code
now take a look at these three different
mutations from the original sequence I
want you to rank the single nucleotide
variations in order of what you think
the most severe change would be by
numbering at number 12 the least severe
change by numbering at number 3 use the
numbers 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 to put into these boxes
right here ranking these particular
snv's and don't forget to use the
genetic code there's a link to it on
this page but you can look it up or you
can print it off and keep it handy
because we're going to need it for the
rest of this lesson for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
