in his Skinner box he actually made his
own food pellets and that was quite
tedious so he wondered what would happen
if it's said of reinforcing every lever
press he actually spaced out some of
those reinforcers and this is how he
discovered an entire field of study of
schedules of reinforcement there are
many different schedules but the tool
just discussed briefly here our ratio
schedules and interval schedules we have
a ratio schedule and I could have a
fixed ratio five which means every fifth
response is reinforced we also have
interval schedules those are time
schedules so I could have a fixed
interval 30 seconds that would mean that
the first response that occurred after
30 seconds was reinforced Skinner
famously compared rats in his Skinner
box to humans by looking at humans in
casinos on a variable ratio schedule
reinforcement occurs on a variable
schedule meaning perhaps after every 10
responses after every 20 responses this
type of schedule engenders a lot of
behavior you can just go to Las Vegas
and watch people at the slot machines
pulling the levers that no different
than rats pressing lovers in their
Skinner boxes Skinner studied rats in
Skinner boxes the behavior first has to
occur before it can be reinforced we can
use shaping which is reinforcing
successive approximations to the target
behavior and we can generate different
types of behavior through schedules of
reinforcement be sure to read the PDF in
the instructors notes on schedules of
reinforcement we're going to talk more
about operant conditioning however this
time with another animal sea lions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
