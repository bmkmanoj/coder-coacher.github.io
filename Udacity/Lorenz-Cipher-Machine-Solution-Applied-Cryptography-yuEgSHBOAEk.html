and the third are likely to be
significantly greater than one-half the
second is not so assuming the keys have
as many zeros and ones as the good key
rotor should be designed to have this is
likely to be equal to one-half there's
no reason to expect it to be greater
than one-half any more likely than it
would be less than 1/2 we're XOR in two
consecutive keep it's the other two are
different former 1/2 and this is what
gives us the opportunity and what gave
Bletchley Park the insight needed to
break the cipher for the third one this
follows from the structure of the
Machine when the s wheels advance while
this probability is about 1/2 but when
they don't advance Delta s is always 0
so this means that the probability that
Delta s is 0 is significantly greater
than 1/2 and it turns out for the
structure of the Lorenz machine
it's about 0.7 3 and to know that you'd
have to look in more detail at the
structure of them wheels and to know how
frequently the s wheels advance and when
they don't advance we know the result is
0 when they do advance about half the
time the result will be 0 getting the
first one right required a little more
linguistic insight and the reason this
is greater than 1/2 well this depends on
subsequent message letters and if
adjacent letters in the message are the
same that ensures that Delta M is equal
to 0 and it turns out that this is a
property that many languages have you
can see that English has it we have
repeated letters here I also have some
repeated letters and wheels so it's more
likely than you would expect by just the
normal letter distribution for
subsequent letters to be identical and
it turns out that this is a property of
German that about 3.3 percent of
digraphs meaning pairs to adjacent
letters are the same letter that means
the probability that the messages are
equal well they could be equal for lots
of other reasons but this bias is it
towards being more likely to be 0 than
nonzero and it turns out that that's
point zero six one
probability for German both of these are
numbers that you didn't have enough
information to guess on your own you
would need to have a analysis of German
text to know that this is the
probability here anyway need a lot more
details on the M wheels to be able to
get that so don't feel bad if you didn't
get this quiz correctly although the
structure of the machine should have
been enough to guess that this is
greater than a half and if you are
familiar with German or could guess that
it has property similar to English you
might have been able to get this one as
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
