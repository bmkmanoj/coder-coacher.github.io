and what do we mean by segmentation well
by segmentation obviously we're gonna
segment the image into a variety of
regions and the regions that you want to
create depend a little bit on what
you're actually trying to do so there is
this general intuition and here we point
to this work up by the folks at at
Berkeley and Jitender Malik and his
group they really pushed hard on this
this is general view that if I show you
a picture like this picture here on the
left here which has these bison that's
what we call them in the States or
buffaloes and we still have them
wandering around not in Atlanta but
general the idea is that I should be
able to you know if I handed that
picture off to anybody I said draw a
border around the different objects you
would get something that looks kind of
like that all right
people would segment and the
segmentations wouldn't all agree right
some people might separate out this
little guy here from the grass but you
can see that this one doesn't but in
general there'd be a good agreement on
where the different elements are in this
database that's pointed to they recorded
a whole bunch of segmentations done by
people and that can be used to train
systems here's just another example
taken from a typical American scene here
in fact it even says that it's in Idaho
and you can see that the regions that
were cut out seem to correspond
intuitively what you might think of as
the different object or something more
along the lines of different parts
another reason you might want to do this
is you've got some objects that are sort
of the ones you want to pay attention to
against the background and you want to
focus on the object and not the
background so here are some examples
refer to as figure-ground segmentation
which is the pulling out of the figure
from the background and these typically
are done in things that are moving
around here we get some animals playing
here's a strange creature referred to as
a young child and the idea is that you'd
like to be able to pull those objects
out so if you want to analyze that we
were doing activity recognition you want
to describe just the movement of the
object another way of thinking about
segmentation again some work that was
introduced by Malick's group is this
notion of super pixels so these two
pictures that you're looking at here you
can see that
everything is sort of cut up into these
little fragments and the idea of these
fragments especially take a look along
around here right is that within those
fragments everything is sort of the same
and it's within the same region and what
that means is when I think about further
cutting up this picture or processing it
I don't have to think beyond these
little regions which were referred to as
well later in the literature as super
pixels right the idea is that I go from
having tens of thousands or hundreds of
thousands of pixels to maybe having
hundreds of super pixels so that makes
the combinatorics much easier and again
getting these super pixels is a form of
segmentation segmentation extends beyond
just single images of course here we're
taking a look at video this is actually
some work that comes from here at
Georgia Tech done by both professor E
your fine ISA and Jim Ray's and
professor Jim Ray's group here and
there's this ice skater going along and
the ice skater is being segmented and
it's not always so easy because here
it's showing you against just ice but
obviously it pulls it out and you want
to be able to extract it carefully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
