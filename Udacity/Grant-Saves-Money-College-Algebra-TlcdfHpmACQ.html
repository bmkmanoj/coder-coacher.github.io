divide both sides of the equation by
1000 on the left-hand side that leaves
us with 1.25 and simplifying what we
have in the parentheses here we have one
point 0 3 to the T on the right-hand
side now all we have over here is a term
with an exponent so we just need to take
some sort of log of both sides to get T
down out of the exponent and by itself
now as you've seen before the log we
need to use should have the same base as
this space right here one point 0 3 so
interestingly enough using log of base
1.03 for both sides well that's
certainly different looking from
anything we've seen but it works in the
same way as a log of a base of any other
number on the right hand side here we
just get T and on the left hand side we
have this log expression that we would
of course like to evaluate now I usually
prefer having tea on the left hand side
so I'm just going to switch it over
there now that just makes things easier
for me to see now since we don't have a
log base one point oh three button on
the calculator we're going to need to
use change of base how about this time
we use log base 10 that means we're
going to have log base 10 of 1.25
divided by log base 10 of 1.03 let's
plug it in and see what that equals so
here's our famous calculator log of 1.25
divided by log of 1.03 what does that
equal let's find out 7.5 4914 and so on
remember though since Grant's interest
gets compounded only once a year we need
to run this up to eight the next highest
integer so that is our answer after
eight years grant will have over twelve
hundred fifty dollars in the account</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
