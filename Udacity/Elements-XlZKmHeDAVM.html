the elements we'd better have a handle
on how many elements there are so how
would you deal with that we could use
some variable I guess to represent the
number of elements and the vector say n
okay work and are there any limits on
the value of n no I don't think so well
it better be better be non-negative
right right it wouldn't make sense to
have a vector of negative length so
we're going to when we talk about all
the elements and the typical element is
going to be in the I position the value
of I is going to go up to this value of
n and of course with with programming
languages you have to worry about
whether they start counting from zero or
they start counting from one here will
say that we start counting for from one
that is the first element of the vector
is in position one and then the
subsequent elements go up to the last
one in being in position n so if there
are n elements in the vector and we're
talking about all but the last okay that
says we're talking about from position 1
to n minus 1 right okay and we want to
have some property that's true about
that and you said that the property was
that if we look in that position and get
the value in that vector it's less than
or equal to the value in the next
position correct so if we're going from
1 to n minus 1 and n is initially 0 that
isn't that asking us to look in the
position minus 1 I thought we said that
in well I guess and can be negative but
we're looking at Oh couldn't we write it
in such a way that we say I and then I
plus 1 so we could start at zero and
then go to one I think we have the same
problem there but what we're trying to
do is make some statement for all I I
being from 1 to n minus 1 if n is 0 then
we're saying from all I from one
2-1 and there aren't any I there so
vacuously it's true okay so even though
we run into this seemingly nonsensical
situation it doesn't actually affect the
truth of the postcondition okay so think
about that that a little bit and get
given that we're then allowed to make
this quantified statement for all I from
1 to n minus 1 and what must be true of
each of those i minus 1 I possibilities
I talk about the output this doesn't get
any easier we got to be processed okay
so why I is less than or equal to or no
because we get a 9-1 so it's going to be
greater than or equal to Y of minus 1
now you I think you had it right the
first time so if I is starting at one
okay and then we're going to be talking
about and we're going to n minus 1 we're
going to be going to Y sub I plus 1 okay
okay so you might want to change your
your slide there ok so what it means to
be ordered is if we look at the first n
minus 1 elements any one of those and
compare it to the one next to it okay
next to it on the right okay it's got to
be less than or equal to it and if we
have that property then we say that the
output is ordered notice that we didn't
say anything in this part of the
postcondition about what those wise are
and how they relate to the input that's
when the second part of the
specification is before we move forward
is it okay to start trying to express
things like this is kind of like
predicate calculus kind of notation is
that what will be leaning towards once
we start writing they are expressing
things in OC l so in this part of the
lesson we're going to use first order
logic it turns out that OC l is just
another syntax on top of first order
logic ok we're going to stick with first
first order logic here eventually i'll
show you a little bit of OC l and then
later lessons will get into the whole
ocl as a language which in addition to
first order logic has some other things
that help it deal with uml</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
