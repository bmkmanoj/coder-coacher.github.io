say a few additional things about the
software requirement specification
document or the SRS and I want to do
that because this is a very important
document and some of the projects
actually require you to produce one so
why is the requirement specification
such an important document that's
because the software requirement
specification document is an important
fundamental way to communicate
requirements to others for example they
represent a common ground between
analysts and stakeholders note however
that different projects might require
different software requirement
specifications so you need to know your
context for example the SRS document
that you have to create for a small
project performed by a few developers
can in most cases be a concise and
informal one conversely the software
requirements specification for a
multi-year project involving a number of
developers can be a fairly complex and
extensive document so again you have to
be aware of your context and build your
software requirement specification
accordingly in order to have a common
format for the SRS document I Triple E
define the standard that divides the
document in predefined sections and in
the context of this course we will use a
simplified version of the I Triple E SRS
format that includes three main sections
an introduction which discusses the
purpose context and objectives of the
project a user requirements definition
which contains the user requirements and
a system requirements specification
which includes about functional and
non-functional requirements and we
provide more information about this
format when we discuss the projects so
to conclude the lesson I want to point
out and in some cases recap a few
important characteristics that
requirements should have first of all
requirements should be simple not
compound each requirement should express
one specific piece of functionality that
the system should provide requirements
should be testable we mentioned this
before but I want to stress it because
it is a very important point and
testable requirements such as the system
should be fast are useless requirements
should be organized related requirements
should be grouped more absurd
requirements should contain more
detailed requirements and priorities
should be clearly indicated when present
finally requirements should be numbered
so that they can be traced for example
number requirements will allow you to
trace them to design implementation and
elements and items which is something
that you may have to do for one of the
projects and that we will discuss in
more detail in a later class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
