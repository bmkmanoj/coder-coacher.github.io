the acronym specs which is simplified
code let's talk about another one p
stands for practicing kindness while
preparing for this course I interviewed
Jacques who as you've seen previously is
an engineer at Udacity he said to me
that it is always important to remember
that the review is being provided to a
student who has invested several hours
of their life into the project that is a
sentiment we always want to remember
while writing reviews by the way Stack
Overflow has some excellent guidelines
on how to provide constructive feedback
and be nice at the same time the link to
that web page is in the instructor notes
and I recommend that you bookmarked it
now when you start doing reviews you
will notice that the software will allow
you to highlight your feedback in one of
three categories nitpicks awesome and
critical we strongly encourage that you
find areas in the students code that are
awesome students need to know how to
improve but they also need to know what
they are doing well currently so don't
be shy to identify things that are
awesome as awesome in the next section
we will see an example of a review or
highlighting an awesome piece of code
and practicing kindness at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
