co-founders and breaking up with the
other co-founders but then I saw people
sticking with the co-founders for four
years I think that one of the most
popular reason one one of the most
common reasons that the part that
companies fail is because the
co-founders fights and they can't walk
together for a long time it happens
mainly because I think there's two main
reasons the first reason is the
definition of half of walking hard
sometime the values of one co-founder is
very different than the are very
different than the values of the other
one if I if I believe that working hard
is working 18 hours a day and not taking
vacation and not taking salaries but my
co-founder of values say that it's
working nine to five but walking really
hard that sometimes collide if our
values is that our employees should
bring one hundred and twenty percent and
they need to do in all-nighters and we
need to ship every day and the other one
thinks that it should be more mellow
it's probably going to break some
sometime another reason is not being
sure what everybody what anyway
everybody's all is so we decided that
you're the CEO but I'm going to be
involved in everything that you're going
to decide even though that my definition
is the CMO this is also not going to
walk and if we see all the sides to
micromanage his co-founder this is also
going to break and and those reasons are
I think the main reasons that the
companies failed because of founders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
