lesson is common sense reasoning let us
take a little bit deeper so that we can
see where the common sense reasoning is
coming here consider this sentence a
Chopard diversion the block imagine an
air agent that pulsar the frame for move
objects with the primitive action and
fills in all of these slots and by now
we know how the agent can do that if I
would ask the agent did Ashok's hand
move when he was putting the wedge in
the block I would explain the agent to
say yes because that is what happens
when people move the weight to the block
they grasp their hands around the wedge
they moved their hand and then the
release difficult now this is what
common sense reasoning is about making
inferences that are not necessarily part
of the input sentence here but a part of
the background knowledge that the agent
has so the agent can make inferences
about the world common sense influences
above the world so the question then
becomes what is the knowledge that a
agent must have so that it can in fact
make the kind of influences that we are
talking about common sense inferences
suppose that the agent had not only
knowledge of the primitive action move
object but also about the sound is sub
actions so here are some of the sub
actions for the given context so the
Condors moving wedges and blocks a agent
might already have a kind of micro story
which says that when actions get done
and things get moved from one place to
another place then typically fingers are
first closed around the first object
then the hand moves the fingers are
released around the second object so
shocked if we can decompose move objects
into a series of move body part actions
was moving object really a primitive
action there's a valid question David
move object was indeed a primitive
action related to the various
superficial forms in which words can
occur in a sentence as an example
transported carried or moved however
this primer Direction move object can
have its own story in terms of further
decomposition notice this particular
decomposition this particular story is
specific to the structural sentence
where a shook puts a wedge in the block
this raises lots of hard issues how many
such stories are there do we have a
story must an agent have such a story
for every
single situation that it encounters
those are hard questions it is not clear
that air currently has an answered all
of those questions so this theory by no
means covers all stories many of these
stories are beyond the scope of this
theory and in fact even for the stories
that are within the scope there is a
hard question about computational
tractability because the number of such
stories can explode very quickly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
