easier to see in the context of an
example so let's go back to our example
from the banana game okay so here's the
you and the you bar matrix from the
banana game this is a wax I got them
backwards didn't I doesn't matter so
there's one player who get zero no
matter what yep that's the with a friend
that's yelling that was curly before and
then there's one who can get either 20
or four depending on which cell they end
up playing and we said that the Nash
equilibria were these two corner cases
the two and the four so that gives us a
the purely cooperative game that which
is the average of the payoffs for the
two players which we're going to compute
the value of using maxi max and the
purely competitive game from the
perspective of the you player so u minus
u bar over 2 which looks like this so
we're going to try to resolve the value
by minimax then there's the same
quantity from the perspective of the u
bar player so it's just the negation of
that one but we're we're going to
compute you know the minimax value for
each of these different games so from
the perspective of the you player what's
the max max value and the minimax value
for these games so let's start with this
one so what's the the maximizing value
it's the thing you're pointing it and
that's the case where you plays the
second row and you bar plays the second
column and they get these payoffs right
we get for billions for bananas that
we're going to divide amongst us sure so
the minimax value so what is what's the
score that the row player you the you
player the maximum score that it could
get for itself minus one you get a minus
one right so how is it how does it do
that by picking this this cell the top
row because the top row if you're trying
to minimize my gains you're going to
choose the left column if I choose the
first row I choose the second where
you're going to choose the right column
i'm going to do even worse right so the
best thing I can do is choose the first
row and I know that so I'm going to
choose the first column good and if we
negate that we get a completely
analogous analysis right so which column
do you choose this or that given you're
trying to maximize your value would be
great if you could use a second column
but I'm trying to minimize your value so
I'm going to choose the first row will
choose the second column
so the safest thing you can do is choose
the first column and I'm going to need
to choose the first row to keep you from
switching to go down to that too right
all right so from the perspective of you
the cocoa value is the sum of these two
things which is one and from ubar's
perspective the cocoa value is the sum
of the min/max game and the max max game
which is going to be three right now we
have to define side payments so use side
payment p is the cocoa value from use
perspective minus the value that you get
in the equilibrium which in this case is
zero but in general it's whatever the
utility is according to you of the
utility maximizing joint action and the
side payments for you bar are the cocoa
value from the perspective of q bar
minus the value that you bar gets in the
utility maximizing joint action so in
this case that's one for you- how much
does you get in that game 00 so it's
going to be 1 whereas from peas
perspective the cocoa value is 3 minus
the payment that you bar gets for
playing the utility maximizing action
which is four so we get minus 10 and
that makes sense because it better be
the case that they are opposite equal
you have to transfer and now you've
answered my question who gets to
transfer money for month dealer that's
right so this the you player is going to
get one and the you bar player is going
to give one and that's the one banana
