mentioned that regular expression
libraries simply use finite state
machines underneath so when this last
problem we've asked you to implement the
lecture parser and interpreter for a
basic regular expression library so
given a regular expression as a string
you need to generate a non-deterministic
finite state machine that accepts the
same exact strings as that regular
expression so this is going to be a lot
of code and I'm not going to go through
it line by line but i'll give you an
overview for one way to solve it so here
i have a solution here's our five types
of tokens and four of which you're
defined like here and the letter is to
find rather than regular expression then
we have our typical ignoring error rules
and here we have the prescence ordering
for regular expressions and then our
parser rolls these should all look
pretty straightforward although you
could have organized your abstract
syntax tree any way you want it and
here's the core of the solution and that
is the interpreter we have basically
three helper functions to help us
generate a non-deterministic finite
state machine out of our abstract syntax
tree that came out of our parser we have
one that adds edges to the finite state
machine one that creates new states and
the last one that walks the absolute
syntax tree so if we see a letter on its
own that means we're going to have to
take a transition to the next state if
we have two entities concatenated we're
going to have to go from the current
state we're at to some middle state and
then lastly to the goal state if we have
a bar that means we're going to go to
possible directions in our finite state
machine and the star is going to loop
back on itself and our function that
does all the magic Lex is the input
takes out the parse tree using our
parser and then interprets the parse
tree returning the finite state machine
that resulted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
