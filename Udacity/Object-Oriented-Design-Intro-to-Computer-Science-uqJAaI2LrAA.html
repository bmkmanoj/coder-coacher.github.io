end of this unit and what we've been
doing is what's called object-oriented
design and I've avoided using that term
so far both because I think it's hard to
say and it's not the most pleasant of
terms the important point is that we've
been developing techniques to manage
complexity by dividing complex problems
into objects and the objects can be
combined to solve the problem that we
care about this is different from
procedural programming that we focused
on for the first seven units of the
class where we're solving a complex
problem by dividing it into procedures
that can be combined to solve the
problem the difference is objects
provide encapsulation we can combine
procedures and data and complex data all
into one object and use that object as
one thing the way we do this in Python
is to use class to make new types and
inheritance to reuse classes to create
lots of new classes so thanks for
sticking through to the end of the unit
and at this point you really are a
powerful programmer you've got the tools
to manage complex programs and you
should be able to start really creating
interesting programs on your own one
thing we haven't talked about yet is how
to deal with the rest of the world in
your programs that's what we'll get to
in the next unit hope to see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
