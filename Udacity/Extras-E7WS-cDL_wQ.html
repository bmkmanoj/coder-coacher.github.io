they tell you how to use unicode
characters i believe it's like font
awesome so you can take these icons and
link them so you get a facebook icon or
a twitter icon you can use so if you
want to add something special you can
check out that course and try to give
that a shot if you want so this is the
CSS Zen card website as you can see here
there's all kinds of little things you
can choose from the side but if we go to
view all designs here we can see that
there's just tons of just these amazing
looking pages let's go to some coffee
carry one I mean like just really well
thought out designs really good use of
font and spacing and just page breaks
and things like that and this is all the
same CSS as say this page or sorry all
the same content my CSS obviously all
the same content to completely different
pages two completely different styles
but all of the same content and just
sort of this beautiful use of CSS so if
you're looking for inspiration on what
you want to do with your CSS or your
style this is a great page to look for
some ideas some of it is very advanced
so there's like by no means do you have
to create something like this the the
people you know making these tend to be
like really well-established graphic
designers but I mean you can just make
you can just get some ideas of some of
the awesome thing you can do a CSS can
you recommend a good source of copyright

independent photographers they post free

foes that you could look on and there's
a filter on flickr for Creative Commons
