closure which is one way to help us
complete the parsing chart in fact it's
one of three ways now we're going to see
a second that sometimes called consuming
the input or shifting over the input
shifting over the input consuming the
input or reading the input is one more
way to help complete the parsing chart
we're going to need all three powers
combined in order to make a totally
complete parsing chart but for now let's
worry about the input so recall that
very generally we could be in a parsing
state that looks like this this is a
rule from our grammar with a dot added
and this from information are starting
at information added and I've drawn a
and B and C and D in purple because
we're not sure if their terminals are
non terminals we just saw what to do if
see the next thing we're expecting is a
non-terminal we compute the closure by
looking at all the rules that start with
C in the grammar but what if C is it
terminal a token a final part of the
input well then we'll just shift over it
and consume it if we were in this
parsing state in chart position I that
means after seeing I tokens this is
where we could be I'm just going to take
my finger and full move it to the right
one so I can just move my finger over so
that instead of expecting a see I've
seen the C if C was the i'th input token
this is a prediction we're making see
may come in the future I go look at what
the user actually entered if C was
actually the next token in the input the
next letter they typed in the next word
in the program then I can shift over it
and say great we have parsed that that's
just what we were expecting that totally
fits our plan no problems at all so if
we were in chart state I I'm going to
put this new information in chart state
I plus 1 because remember the number
here in the chart corresponds to how
many tokens we've seen and we're only in
this brave new world after we've seen
the sea the sea was one token previously
we'd seen I tokens so now we've seen I
plus 1 tokens this entire approach is
called shifting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
