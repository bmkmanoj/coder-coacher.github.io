testing so consider now this other
function called fun and let's assume
that we want to test this function
without having a specification so
without knowing exactly what it needs to
do but just by looking at the code that
we will try to do probably in this case
is to try to just execute all the
statements in the function and notice I
will talk extensively of what does you
mean to the white box testing later on
in the next two classes so if that's our
goal if our goal is to cover all the
statements any input will really do so
any test case that will execute all
statements in the code and we'll have a
complete in a white box testing coverage
for the program imagine that I now give
you a specification for this function
and what the specification says is that
this function inputs an integer
parameter param and returns half of its
value if param is even and its value
unchanged otherwise that means if param
is odd so looking at this specification
we can clearly see that the function fan
works correctly only for even integers
and it doesn't work for odd integers
because it computes half of the value of
the parameter and returns it every time
no matter what param is so this is a
case in which white box testing could
easily miss the problem because as we
said any input will exercise the code
it's just by chance that we could reveal
one that revealed the problem in the
code conversely if we were to work in a
black box manner typically looking at
the specification we will select at
least one odd and one even input number
to exercise all of the specified
behavior and we will find the problem
right away so these two examples are
just very small examples in our Calvin
stretched but these kind of issues occur
on a much bigger scale and in much more
subtle ways in real-world software and
so what these examples do is to show you
how black box and white box testing are
really complementary techniques so in
the next two lessons we will explore
these two types of techniques in detail
we will see different kinds of white box
and black box testing and we'll talk
about their strengths and limitations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
