doctored this client thread to start
executing the server procedure it can
transfer control to the server so it
transfers the control to the server and
so now now we are starting to execute
the server procedure in the server's
address space and in the service address
space because a stack has been mapped in
this is also available to the server
domain and the first thing that's going
to happen in the server domain is our
server stub it's going to get into
action and take the arguments that are
sitting in the a stack and copy them
into the stack that the server procedure
is going to use remember I told you that
the kernel provides a special stack for
the purpose is an e stack execution
stack and that is the stack into which
the client the server stub is going to
copy the a stack arguments into that e
stack and then at that point the
procedure foo is ready to start
executing so at this point procedure foo
is like any normal procedure it finds
the information it wants on the stack it
does its job once it is done with
executing this procedure it has to pass
back the results to the client and what
is going to happen is that the server
stub is going to take the results of
this procedure execution and copy them
into the haystack and of course all of
this action is happening in the server
domain without any mediation by the
colonel so once the server stub has
copied the results into the a stack at
that point it can trap into the kernel
and this is the vehicle by which the
kernel can transfer control back to the
client so it it does a return trap now
when this return trap happens there is
no need for the kernel to validate this
trap as opposed to the call trap because
the up call was made by the colonel in
the very first place and therefore it is
really expecting this return trap to
happen and so the colonel doesn't have
to do any special validation for this
and at this point what the
is going to do is it is basically going
to read dr. the thread to start
executing in the client add recipe so
basically it knows the return address
where it has to go back in order to
start executing the client code and it
knows the clients address space so it's
going to read dr. the thread to start
executing in the client address space so
when the client thread is rescheduled to
execute at that point the client stub
gets back into action copies the results
that are sitting in the a stack into the
stack of the client and once it has done
that the client thread can continue on
with its normal execution so that's what
is going on and the important point that
you notice is that the copying through
the kernel that used to happen is now
completely eliminated because the
arguments are passed through the a stack
into the server and similarly the result
is passed through the a stack into the
client so let's analyze what we've
accomplished in terms of reducing the
cost of the RPC in the actual calls that
are being made between the client and
the server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
