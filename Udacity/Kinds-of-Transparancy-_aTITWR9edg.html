which you might consider versus access
transparency that is it's a particular
computational or data resource which the
application requires available locally
or remotely and in particular does the
application need to know whether it's
local or remote if it's accessed
transparent the application doesn't need
to know extending this is the idea of
location transparency is it necessary to
know the physical location of a resource
third is migration transparency that is
can we move a resource from one physical
machine to another in such a way that
the rest of the system doesn't have to
know that it's moved this can be tricky
of course if you're in the middle of
using a resource when it moves there's
the possibility that your interaction is
going to be inconsistent or even break
and finally replication transparency one
way for dealing with reliability issues
is replication at one extreme would be
database replication where all of your
data is in more than one place and if
you're one of your databases go down at
least you have the other one there okay
and then as far as transparency is
concerned is your application aware that
there are multiple database servers in
that situation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
