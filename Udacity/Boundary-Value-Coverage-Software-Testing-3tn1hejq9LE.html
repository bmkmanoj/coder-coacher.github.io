talk about is boundary value coverage
boundary value coverage unlike some of
the other coverage metrics we looked at
it doesn't have an especially tight
technical definition people use it to
mean different things we're gonna look
at it in a broad sense what boundary
value coverage basically says is when
our program depends on some numerical
range and when the program has different
behaviors based on numbers within that
range then we should test numbers close
to the boundary so let's take the
example where we're writing a program to
determine whether somebody who lives in
the USA is permitted to drink alcohol so
we want is if they're 21 years of age or
more it's fine for them to drink alcohol
and if they are less than 21 that is to
say 20 or less then it is not legal for
them to drink alcohol if want to get a
boundary value of coverage on this
program we'd want to include the ages of
20 and 21 in our test input and possibly
also 19 and 22 since they're close
enough to the boundary values that
they're that there may be interesting
behaviors lurking there as well the
insight here is that one of the most
common kinds of errors that we make
while creating software is off by one
errors wife by one errors can almost
always be triggered by a value at the
boundary and so that's what we're trying
to do here what I've done here is framed
boundary value coverage as a function of
only one variable and also I framed it
in terms of the program specification
not in terms of the implementation so
let's look at those two issues in turn
so let's consider a program with two
inputs let's assume for the sake of
argument that these inputs are treated
independently by the software that we're
running so the first input is going to
be the age of your car and we're an
insurance company here and we're going
to decline to insure cars more than 20
years old the other parameter is the age
of the driver and here we're going to
decline to insure drivers who are less
than 18 years old if the software treats
these and values independently we're
probably okay testing values around 18
independently of the age of the car and
testing car ages around 20 years old
independently of the age of the driver
now on the other hand if we had specific
knowledge that our implementation
considered these variables together then
we probably would also need to test with
combinations of inputs that are near the
fat boundaries and you can see the
problem here is that of course as the
number of inputs of the program goes up
the number of test cases can grow very
large because we have to consider the
interaction between all possible
combinations of variables that are
dependent on the other hand if our
variables are independent then we can
test them separately so now let's
briefly live visit the issue of whether
we're doing boundary value of coverage
with respect to the requirements of the
specification for a piece of software or
whether we're doing it
to the implementation okay so let's go
and revisit the program we looked at a
little bit earlier or I inserted a bug
into our stats function which caused it
to misbehave for some inputs and not for
others so if you recall we have the
function here stats which computes the
minimum the maximum median and the mode
of a list of numbers and the problem I
posed to you in a quiz was to break this
function in such a way that a collection
of test cases getting good coverage on
it wouldn't discover the bug and so the
way I accomplished this was by taking
the absolute value of the inputs and so
here's a bug that we've introduced it's
only going to be discoverable when you
pass numbers into the function which
contain negative values so if we think
about what it takes to get boundary
value coverage on a function like this
and now we're talking about around your
boundary value coverage considering the
implementation not just the
specification what would happen is a
function like absolute value would
change its behavior around zero and so
what we would need to do to get boundary
value coverage of the absolute value
function is call it with a negative
argument and a positive argument so to
get good boundary value coverage on this
function we would have been forced to
call it with a list containing at least
one negative number and we most likely
in that case would have discovered the
bug let's look at this function in its
broader context we have a lot of code
here for example I is less than min I is
greater than max we have a lot of
different operators in here that all
have different behaviors around certain
boundaries and so to get good boundary
value coverage on this function overall
would be probably extremely difficult I
don't know of good tools automating this
in Python there are techniques such as
mutation testing that can automate
boundary value coverage at least in some
forms in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
