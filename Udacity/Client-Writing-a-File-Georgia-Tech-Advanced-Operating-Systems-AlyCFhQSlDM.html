straightforward what the client is doing
is actually aggregating all the rights
that is going on into this log segment
data structure which is in its memory
and at some point it decides that it
wants to flush this log segment and put
it on the disk and when it decides to do
that it knows the stripe group this
particular log segment it belongs to and
so it is going to take this log segment
and stripe it on the storage servers
that are part of the stripe group so
once it does this right to its stripe
group the client will notify the manager
on the log segments that are being
flushed to the disk so that the manager
has up-to-date information about the
status of the files it manages so XFS is
a research prototype of a distributed
file system there are been other
instances of distributed file systems
such as the Andrew file system and the
coda file system that were built at CMU
and in fact the Andrew file system
served a community of users in the CMU
campus in a later lesson we will return
to discussing distributed file systems
again specifically we will look at
Andrew file system and discuss the issue
of security and privacy for user files
in a distributed system but I want to
leave you with some closing thoughts on
the XFS file system first of all log
base striping and particularly
subsetting the storage servers over
which you stripe the log that's a
technical innovation the second
technical innovation is combining
cooperative caching with dynamic
management of data and metadata and the
last technical nugget is the distributed
log cleaning making sure that the
responsibility for cleaning up the logs
from the disk is not left to one node
but it is actually distributed and
especially taking advantage of the fact
that the clients who are the mutaters
for the file system meaning they are the
guys that are writing to the file system
they can keep a count of the changes
that they make
to the log segments and use that
information in the log cleaning
effectively</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
