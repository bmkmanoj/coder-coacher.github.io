how a s path prepending can be used to
control inbound traffic as it turns out
longest prefix match can also be used to
control inbound traffic suppose that a
si owns 10100 slash 16 and it might
advertise that prefix out both of its
upstream links and that route might
similarly be advertised further upstream
now of course as we know from a previous
lesson given the advertisement of one
prefix upstream ASD is going to pick one
best BGP route along which to send
traffic back to a but let's suppose that
a si wanted to balance that traffic
across its incoming links well in that
case a si could actually advertise
routes for to more specific prefixes
effectively splitting the slash 16 in
half so in addition to advertising 10.1
slash 16
across both links a si might advertise
10.1 slash 17 on the top link and 10.11
28.0 slash 17 the other half of the
slash 16 on the bottom link now if
either link fails the covering slash 16
will ensure that the prefix remains
reachable by one of the two upstream
links but because longest prefix match
wins the traffic for 10.1.1.1 out
reverse the bottom link and the traffic
for 10.1 slash 17 would now traverse the
top link effectively sending traffic for
half of the prefixes along the top path
and traffic for the other half of the
prefixes along the bottom path although
we just explored a perfectly good reason
to D aggregate a contiguous prefix it
turns out that sometimes autonomous
systems may D aggregate larger prefixes
unnecessarily a report called The Cider
report which is released weekly shows
autonomous systems who are advertising
IP prefixes that at least according to
observation are contiguous and could be
aggregated for example the top offender
for the week of December 12 2013 was a
s60 389 this single autonomous system is
actually advertising more than 3000
unique IP prefixes The Cider reports
analysis
jests that with appropriate aggregation
this autonomous system could instead
advertise only 56 unique IP prefixes now
this might be overly optimistic as we
just explored there are perfectly good
reasons to D aggregate a contiguous IP
prefix into multiple smaller contiguous
IP prefixes but nonetheless the report
shows that there are probably a lot more
IP prefixes in the global internet
routing table then there could be if a
s's took full advantage of aggregation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
