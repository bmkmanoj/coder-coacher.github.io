one-time pad is secure I want to do a
brief review of probability if you feel
very confident that you understand
probability well it's fine to skip this
section but I think for many students it
will be helpful to review probability
and for some this will be new it's not
necessary to have a lot of background in
probability entering this class but we
will certainly be using it in
cryptography so to talk about
probability we need to think of sets of
outcomes we'll use Omega to represent
the set of all possible outcomes this is
sometimes known as a probability space
and for a simple example if we think
about flipping a coin Omega is the set
of outcomes week again we could get it
to land heads and we'll call that H or
we could get it to land tails and we'll
call that T if our probability space has
a uniform distribution that means each
outcome has equal probability and we can
write that as a probability using P as
our probability functions so P is a
function that takes as a template some
outcome and it Maps that to a real
number between 0 and 1 0 would mean that
event never happens
1 would mean that event always happens
so if we assume a fair coin with the
uniform distribution well in the
probability that we get heads is equal
to 1/2 and the probability that we get
tails is also equal to 1/2 so that's how
we think of mathematical coins and we
hope to have mathematical coins to use
in our crypto systems real coins aren't
so perfect so let's assume instead that
there are 3 possible outcomes
now our probability space will be heads
tails and edge the edge outcome does not
happen frequently and we'll make the
probability distribution so the
probability of heads is 0.49 9 9 9 the
probability of tails we'll assume our
coin is still fair that the probably of
tails is equal the probability of heads
which is 4 followed by four 9s is that
enough to determine what is the
of edge the outcome II so I've given you
two of the probabilities can you
determine what is the probability of the
third possible outcome which is landing
on the edge denoted by E</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
