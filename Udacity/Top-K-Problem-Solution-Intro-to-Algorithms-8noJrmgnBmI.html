running time is asymptotically big theta
for selection and insertion as a
function of N and K and then then we can
substitute in the value of K so if
there's n elements in our list and we're
interested in the top K what the
selection algorithm does is it goes
through the elements one at a time and
for each of these n elements it tries to
figure out where in this list of K it
needs to go so for each of these n it
does an insertion or a selection okay
let's do insertion first it does an
insertion in this list that insertion
takes Big O of K time it's basically
running through this list figuring out
where the value goes sticking it in and
shifting everything else over the
insertion algorithm is going to take n
times that or a total of big theta of n
times K now selection is the same what
happens in selection is you run through
this list of N and you pull out the
maximum and delete so that takes big
theta of n time and you repeat that once
for each of the elements that you want
to pull out so it becomes also big theta
of n times K sorting on the other hand
sorts this entire list which I said
before was n log n then well it's kind
of done at that point but you could
imagine also looping back through the
first K elements but we basically have
them at that point and K is smaller than
n so asymptotically that's the whole
running time now if K is n over 2 that's
n times n over 2 where N squared this is
big theta of N squared this is big theta
of n log n we're much better with M log
n so if it's a very long list that were
that we're wanting the top values of you
might as well just sort the whole thing
square root of n well what happens with
square root of n square root of n where
look we're comparing n log in to n times
the square root of n which is n to the
three halves n to the three halves is
asymptotically larger than n log n so
we're still better off just sorting the
whole list let's go to the other side of
the spectrum what if there's a hundred
elements in the list well if K is a
constant K is 100 then the big theta of
this is just big data of n it's linear
time so linear beats n log
so definitely want to choose these
algorithms over sorting if it's a small
number of elements that you want to know
log log in is similar we have we end up
with n times log log n which is better
than n log N and finally and this I
guess should be kind of obvious at this
point if we substitute log in in for K
we have n log in for selection insertion
but we also have n log in for sorting so
these are actually the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
