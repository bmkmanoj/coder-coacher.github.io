out what the general rule is so imagine
that we've got here's where in some node
call it say it's numbered hi what can we
figure out about the parent number of I
and the two child number survive so the
child numbers are actually quite easy if
you look at them it's always the node
number doubled plus one that's the left
child and the right child is Jason to it
so that is 2i plus two and we can work
out from this what the number for the
parent ought to be all we need to do is
subtract one from I and have it and in
Python that will actually cause it to
get rounded down but in math symbols
will just write the little floor here so
let's just double-check that so node 6
6-1 is 5 half of 5 is two-and-a-half
rounded down as 25 minus one is for half
of that is too we don't have to round it
so that's so both five and six have the
parent of two coming up the other way to
doubled plus 1 is 5 to double plus two
is six so that gets us this kind of
local structure and this is repeated
throughout so therefore we could use
this to try to figure out what the right
child of 72 would be it's 72 doubled
which is 144 plus 2 which is 146</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
