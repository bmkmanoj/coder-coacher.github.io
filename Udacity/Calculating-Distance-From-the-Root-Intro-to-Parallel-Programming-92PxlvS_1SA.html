we want to solve today and then we'll
look at how we might solve it we want to
start at a specific node and we'll call
it s and then visit every node in the
graph and record its distance from s in
terms of graph hops we call this
quantity its depth so any neighbor of s
has depth 1 any neighbor of those
neighbors that we haven't visited yet
has depth 2 and in general a neighbor of
a node with depth D that hasn't already
been visited has depth D plus 1 I'm not
sure how familiar our international
audiences with the actor Kevin Bacon but
the bacon number of a particular actor
is the number of degrees of separation
from Kevin Bacon so if I had acted in a
movie
with say John Belushi my bacon number
would be 2 because John Belushi's bacon
number is 1 because he appeared with
Kevin Bacon in the outstanding film
animal house we could generate the bacon
numbers for all movie actors from a
graph that records who appeared in
movies together and we could do this
with a breadth-first traversal that
begins at Kevin Bacon and calculates
depth for each vertex for each actor in
the graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
