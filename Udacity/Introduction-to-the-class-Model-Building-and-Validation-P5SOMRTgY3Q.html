will be very beneficial for aspiring and
practicing data scientists in industry
and in academia in this class we will
learn how to build and validate models
many of you may have already taken a
course in machine learning or data
science and may already be familiar with
machine learning models in this course
we will take a more general approach
walking through the questioning modeling
and validation steps of the model
building process now the goal is to get
you to practice thinking in depth about
a problem and coming up with your own
solutions many examples we will attempt
may not have one correct answer but will
require you to work through the problems
applying the methods that we hope to
illustrate throughout this class it is
somewhat like a game of chess the rules
are quite well-defined but one needs to
have a strategy for winning in any given
situation there may be multiple correct
moves leading you to victory and
numerous incorrect ones it is to study
and practice you learn the strategies
for winning at the end of this class you
will feel confident in your ability to
conquer new problems by applying an
iterative process of analysis that takes
you from a vague initial question to a
rigorous model addressing it and
quantifying it the uncertainty that
exists in any model in addition you
might learn about new types of models to
apply to problems and you will learn how
to use the best model for the task that
takes the most advantage of data instead
of applying one blackbox model after
another and hoping for the best but
before all of that let's get to know
each other</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
