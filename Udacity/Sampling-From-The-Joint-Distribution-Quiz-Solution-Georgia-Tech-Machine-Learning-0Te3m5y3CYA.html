the answer is here actually I don't know
what you're looking for here oh okay
well so one thing that's true we had to
sample the the variables from A to E and
that's alphabetical order so do you
think that's what I was looking for uh
maybe in this case but I would think
that that wouldn't be generally true
true right so yeah alphabetical is not
what I was looking for so there's a it's
a graph theoretic property that says we
want to basically put the nodes in order
so that you always put the things that
have incoming links that haven't been
visited yet after the ones where you
they have been visited well so it is a
lot like alphabetical or a lot like
let's lexicographic but it's topological
there we go yeah that was what I was
looking for so topological sort which
makes perfect sense right and so this is
a standard thing that you can do with a
graph and it's very quick to to actually
compute one of these it does depend on a
particular property though let's see
topological only makes sense if you
really can go from no parents to parents
so it cannot be cyclical you can have
arrows that take you back so II can't be
a parent of a and also have a be one of
its parents so basically must be a
cyclic right and that's going to be true
in these cases because we're always
going to set it up so that in a in a
Bayes net the variable that we're the H
variable depends on other variables but
they ultimately has to bottom out there
can't be cyclic dependencies so it is an
directed acyclic graph so what would it
mean if there were cycles I don't know I
don't know what to do is such a graph it
just doesn't mean anything at all I
guess yeah I mean there there is a
family of undirected models mm-hmm but
we're talking only about the directed
ones here so the directed ones yet have
to be a cyclic for the for the
probability distribution to be
meaningful well that means I'm sure we
could make something up but this is
typically this is how it's done it's we
constrain ourselves to a cyclic graphs
well if a Bayesian network is supposed
to capture conditional independencies
then if you had cycles that's like
saying there are none right and then I'm
sure that means I could make it mean
something so here we want the
probability of a conditioned on
probability of a well maybe that's like
probability of what what a was one time
step ago or could mean that you know
that that were
actually putting constraints on the
joint assignment of to all the variables
but yeah it's not really it doesn't
really it makes things more complicated
and that's not the model that that is
the typical one okay fair enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
