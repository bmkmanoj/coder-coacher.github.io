can do with this representation is
recover the joint distribution remember
a couple couple slides ago we looked at
the issue of how can we go from the
district joint distribution to
specifying what the probabilities are
the conditional probability tables
they're called
at each of these nodes but we can
actually go the other direction as well
we can go from from the values in these
conditional probability tables that each
of the nodes to computing the
probability of any combination any joint
combination of variables that we want so
it turns out it's really it's really
simple we can just go and use these same
ideas and say the joint probability for
some assignment to the variables is
equal to just the product of all the
individual values so the prod the
probability that that value of a would
be taken times the probability that that
value of B would be taken times the
probability that that value of C would
be taken conditioned on those the values
that were chosen for a and B so it's
just like in the sampling case right and
that's much more compact to
representation that's a good observation
yeah so how if these were boolean
variables how many values would we need
to specify for the Joint Distribution in
the standard representation where you
just assign a probability to everything
well if I ignore the fact that there are
some constraints we might be able to
take advantage of it would be 2 to the
fifth because there are five variables
right but here we've broken it down into
smaller chunks so the probability of a
is just specified by single number
probably of be specified by a single
number probability of C is specified for
a single number for each combination of
a and B that's four of them
this also is requires four values and
this requires four values so this is
really what it's like two to the fifth
what minus one I guess because if I tell
you the first 31 values the last the 30
tooth value is just one minus the sum of
all the others so this is 14 numbers
versus 31 hmm so you're right it is more
compact 31 is bigger right but let's
imagine that all of the variables were
in fact completely independent of one
another then you would have five you
know only need five numbers right
because it would be the product of the
un-- conditions yeah which is what we'd
get if we had kind of like just a set of
weighted coins that they're unrelated to
each other but each one has some
probability of coming up heads the
probability of getting some some
particular combination like a is heads
and B is tails and
is heads and Diaz heads and ia's heads
we could just break that down to the
probability of the individual events
right so then all of the just like with
the joint distribution where you have
this exponential growth because we need
to know everything here you have the
exponential growth that only depends
upon the number of parents you have if
you have no parents
then it's constant if you have parents
then it grows exponentially with the
number of parents good right so the
fewer parents the more compact the
distribution ends up being</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
