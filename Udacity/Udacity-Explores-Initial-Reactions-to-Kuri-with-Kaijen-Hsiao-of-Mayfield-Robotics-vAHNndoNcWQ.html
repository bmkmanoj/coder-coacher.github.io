reactions we get are oh my gosh that's
so cute
it spends a lot on what age the person
is so kids especially seem to really
love curry small children a lot of them
they come in they see curry and they
immediately run up the curry and they
want to hug hurry and someone will ask
oh can I hug curry and we're like of
course you can hug curry
they also like to pet the robot a lot
the robot has touched on sirs in his
head so when you pet him he smiles up
and looks at you and it's really cute
and even though at this moment we don't
have it hooked up to anything even
particularly interesting we're still
working on exactly how curry should
track your face and look more lifelike
by like interacting with you in that way
if you pet him he just looks up and
smiles and that's enough for them just
pet him over and over and over again
because kids just naturally think that
curry is obviously a friend the
companion and someone that they could
you play with older kids they tend to be
a little more standoffish alaimo cool to
express that much interest but they tend
to be curious about the robot and they
ask questions like you know Oh what does
he do and how did you make him I've been
very surprised how many people have what
I call the robot dream and that is
adults who when they were younger or you
know I didn't point their lives they saw
Star Wars or they saw wall-e and they
thought oh I would love to have an r2d2
or wall-e of my very own and they see
carry and they see in him the chance to
fulfill the robot dream it's finally
their chance to have a robot character
in their home come to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
