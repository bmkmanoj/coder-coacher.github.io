interfaces with match set finds the set
of remainders if there is a set of
remainders then it finds the shortest
one the shortest remainder should be the
longest text and then we want to return
that so we want to return the text and
it's a match not a search so the match
has to be at the beginning of the text
and it would go up to match so we match
from the beginning the text and how far
do we want to go well everything except
the remainder and so how much is that
well we can just subtract the from the
length of the text the length of the
shortest and that gives us the initial
piece of the longest possible match and
here search calls in to match and what
we do is we start iterating we start at
position number zero if there's a match
therefore the text starting at position
zero then we want to return it if not we
increment I to 1 and we say that does
the text from position 1 on is there a
match there and so on and we just keep
on going through till we find one and so
but here we want to say is if the match
is not none then return down notice that
would be a bad idea to say if M returned
M normally it's idiomatic in Python to
say that if we're looking for a true
value but the problem here is that the
empty string we want to count as a true
value a pattern might match the empty
string and that counts as a match not as
a failure so we can't just say if M
because empty string counts as false so
we have to say if M is not not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
