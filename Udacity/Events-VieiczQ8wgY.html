again it's an abstraction and we'll say
it's a single instantaneous noticeable
occurrence in authors also think of it
as being some kind of stimulus because
the system is going to respond to it
events in these kinds of systems can
either be asynchronous or synchronous
asynchronous events you can think of is
kind of randomly occurring they can
become in bursts they can be spread out
synchronous events are more likely to
come at periodic intervals often the
system has some sort of clock or event
loop that controls the occurrence of
events or when they can be dealt with in
our in our approach to modeling these
systems the events can serve as the
reason or stimulus for a change of state
in the system that that change of state
is sometimes called a state transition
for example when you got your envelope
through the mail that said you were
admitted to college that's a significant
state transition in your life events can
occur through all results of user
actions like hitting hitting a button on
the on the graphical user interface they
can occur because of changes in the data
in the in the state space the
temperature getting above 90 degrees or
they can be queued by the passage of
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
