the block size is small we could guess
all of these blocks it turns out that
the block size isn't that small the
parameters we saw we're using our c4 our
c4 is a symmetric encryption algorithm
it at least loosely stands for Ron's
code for that's not what it officially
stands for but that's what most people
think of it as and this is Ron Rivest
the RN RSA who invented the symmetric
encryption algorithm that's known as our
c4 and the block size is typically used
in TLS is 64 bits
TLS could also be using AES with a block
size of 128 bits so that would mean the
attack is only useful if the attacker
can guess those 64 bits in a useful way
and has a way to control the message
that seems like it might not be much of
a threat and this attack was actually
known it was identified by Gregory bard
in 2004 and vo does not too serious of a
problem let's see Ellis because it does
give an attacker an advantage but these
blocks are big enough that the ability
to do this and if you can only guess one
more message if you can only control the
server well you don't have too much
power and it assumes a quite powerful
attacker that has an ability to control
the messages the server is going to send
well it turns out that there are very
serious implications of this attack they
depend on being able to inject
JavaScript code so there are ways that
an attacker might be able to control the
responses and using JavaScript requests
if the attacker controls JavaScript on
the page that the victim is using TLS to
request
well that JavaScript can make repeated
requests of luth server those are still
going to be part of the encrypted
session but the attacker can control
what those requests are and perhaps can
design requests that the server will
respond to in a particular way giving
the attacker control over the first
block in the next message
the other thing the attacker could do is
figure out a way to know many of the
bits so suppose the attacker knows 58
bits and there's one byte but that byte
contains one character of an
authentication token that could be part
of a cookie say and it turns out that
there is an attack that exploits this
it has the rather clever acronym beast
browser exploit against ssl/tls
and this found ways to use this
cryptographic weakness and it turns out
if you can inject JavaScript into the
page you can control these requests
enough to actually use this and this was
demonstrated quite recently in 2011
showing a way that you could use this
and this technique of controlling many
of the bits into first block to break an
authentication token for a paypal cookie
so this is quite a powerful attack if
you only need to guess eight bits at a
time you expect to only need 128 guesses
for each byte</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
