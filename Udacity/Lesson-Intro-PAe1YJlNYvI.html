connect your build process of the
browser magic I'm going to need you to
be a bit more specific all right all
right in let me tell you about the
magical world of life editing say your
job is to construct shelves just imagine
how much your life would suck without a
power drill sure a manual screwdriver
does a job and works if you're just
constructing a shelf for yourself once a
year but a power drill will save you
lots of time and energy in the long run
and will be a great optimization unless
your plan is to get popeyes arms of
course in the world of web development
you'll see a very similar pattern you
make a change to your code save rebuild
if you need to switch to the browser and
reload the page these micro context
switches might seem harmless but you're
doing these thousands of times each day
if you now ask yourself well surely
there's a better way then you'd be right
live editing solves exactly that problem
it works by having a watcher in your
editor or build process that's connected
to a similar watch in the browser when
you save a file these to communicate and
the website is reloaded or patched on
the fly without you having to intervene
that means fewer context switches as it
can now have you editor right next to
your browser window and see changes
happen as your code in a next hands-on
step James is going to be teaching you
how to set up live editing in three
different ways life on every keystroke
in sublime on every save by a gulp and
skipping the editor all together to move
your entire workflow into the browser in
the end we prefer to build to a version
and James going to tell you why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
