coherence definition let's say that we
have two cores in a system that is
supposed to be coherent let's say that
core one executes this program
it sets 8 to 1 then waits for a to
change from 1 so it's going to loop here
as long as a is equal to 1 sets a again
to 1 and then prints done one at the
same time when core 1 is started on this
core 2 starts on another program that
writes 0 to the same location a in
shared memory waits until a changes from
0 set a to 0 again then prints down 2
and remember that core 1 and core 2 need
not necessarily execute these two
programs in lockstep so it's not
necessary that Corwin executes this
while core 2 does this
Corwin does this well core to this and
so on it could be for example that
Corwin executed several of these while
core 2 is still not even beginning so
you can insert arbitrary delays in
between any of the statements here and
here the question for you is which of
the following printouts are possible
first core 1 prints done one then core
to Princeton to the next possibility
first quarto prints done two then corwin
prints done one the next option Corwin
prints done one but core to get stuck
and never gets to print down to the next
option score one gets stuck in ever gets
to print down one but core to
successfully prints done 2 and the final
option is that nothing is printed
because both of the cores gets stuck so
neither of them prints anything ever so
which of these five options are actually
possible when these two programs run in
a coherent system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
