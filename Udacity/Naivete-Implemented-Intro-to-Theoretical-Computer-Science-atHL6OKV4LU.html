Alice's algorithm for finding a valid
vertex cover is very inefficient but
fairly easy to program to so I'd like to
go ahead and try and implement this and
we'll do this in two separate parts
first I want you to find a procedure
validity check that returns true if and
only if the given cover is a valid
vertex cover for the graph that is input
and the graph is going to be a list of
lists an adjacency matrix like the we've
seen before and the cover is simply
going to be a list of the same length as
the number of vertices in the graph so
for example for the given graph if we
have attempted to cover of say a and C
then the cover that we would input to
validity check would be 1 0 1 0 and the
graph that we would give be 0 1 1 0
inside a list 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 and 0 0 1
0 again in a list so these would be our
inputs to validity check HERE so what I
want you to do is fill in the rest of
this function here the next thing that I
want you to do is fill in vertex cover
naive where it simply takes an input
graph as a list of lists as an adjacency
matrix and finds the minimum vertex
cover of that input graph and you can
use validity check to do this so your
code should check if the assignment is
valid for a given assignment should
calculate the size of the assignment and
then it should update the minimum vertex
cover variable if appropriate so ok
great
I hope you have fun with this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
