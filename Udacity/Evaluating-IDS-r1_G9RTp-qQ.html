detection system we typically use
accuracy metrics to measure the
detection algorithm we use detection
rate or true positive rate to measure
how well an IDs can detect intrusions
that is given that there is an intrusion
how likely with the ideas correctly
output an alert we can also use false
negative rate that is how many
intrusions did we miss another aspect of
detection accuracy is the false alarm
rate that is given that there's no
intrusion how likely is the ideas is
going to falsely output an alert we can
also use true negative rate that is how
likely normal activities are correctly
classified as normal and if you are as a
salmon you may want to know about the
basin detection rate of an ideas that is
given that the ideas has already
produced an alert how likely is it that
an intrusion actually occurs in your
network we can more formally summarize
this matrix here we use a to represent
alarm or positive I to Levinson
intrusion detection rate or true
positive rate is the probability that
given there's an intrusion how likely
the ideas will produce an alert and
false negative rate is one minus true
positive rate false alarm rate is the
probability that given that there's no
intrusion not I meaning is normal how
likely an ideas would incorrectly open
an alert and to negative rate is one
minus false alarm rate Beijing detection
rate is the probability that given their
ideas alert how likely there's actually
an intrusion in addition to the
detection algorithms we can also
evaluate ideas in terms of its system
architecture we want the ideas to be
scalable meaning that you can function
at high speed networks we also want the
ideas to be resilient to attacks meaning
that it is not easily disabled by
attacks that target the ideas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
