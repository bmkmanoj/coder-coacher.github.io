complicated and involves a bunch of
moving parts like c1 c2 s and n zeroes
and ands and FS and G's let's see
whether the definition at least
satisfies some intuitive properties that
we wanted to so to the extent that we're
saying that big theta means that two
functions grow roughly the same as each
other then it ought to be the case that
if some function f of n is in big theta
of G of n it seems like it should go the
other way as well if F of n grows
roughly the same as G of n then G of n
should be roughly the same as f of n is
that true so here's some possible
choices no as much as we would like this
to be true it just doesn't follow from
the definition of big theta that we just
gave yes because big theta is like
equality inequality is reflexive so big
data ought to be reflexive and then
another possibility is yes because we
can use the c1 and c2 from the
definition of F of n is in theta G of n
use the reciprocals and that sandwich
says G by F</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
