self-driving car and the first thing we
want it to be able to do is recognize a
simple traffic light and use control
flow to start driving when it sees a
green light we first need to know
whether the light is green or not and if
it is then we want to drive so let's
translate this into Java code we first
need to know if the light is green and
we can store this information as a
boolean variable which I'll call is like
green and this will either be true or
false then let's create our if statement
we want our test condition to check if
is like green is true so we'll say if is
like green and if this test condition is
true we'll enter whatever code is
contained inside the curly braces of our
if statement and we'll execute that code
and inside our if statement we'll just
print out the action we want our car to
take which is to drive if our test
condition isn't met if is like Green is
false Java will skip over our F code and
go to the end of this closing curly
brace and if there are more lines of
code down here it will continue reading
lines of code from here so this is our
finished if statement so if is like
Green is true and we run this code we'll
enter our if statement block of code and
the print output will be Drive if our
test condition is like Green was false
we wouldn't print out anything it's also
worth noting that we could add even more
if statements after this one if we want
to check and act on other test
conditions next let's practice writing
our own if statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
