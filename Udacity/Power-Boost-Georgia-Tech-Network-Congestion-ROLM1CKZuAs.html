boost which is a traffic shaping
mechanism that was first deployed in
commercial broadband networks in june
two thousand six by comcast so power
boost allows a subscriber to send at a
higher rate for a brief period of time
so if you subscribe to at a rate of ten
megabits per second then power boost
might allow you to send at a higher rate
for some period of time before being
shaped back to the rate at which you
were subscribed at so power boost
targets the spare capacity in the
network for use by subscribers who don't
put a sustained load on the network
there are two types of power boost if
the rate at which the user can achieve
during this burst window is set to not
exceed a particular rate then we say
that the policy is capped pair boost
otherwise the policy or the shaping is
called unkept power boost now in the
unkept setting the configuration is
simple and as we described in the last
lesson the area here is the power boost
bucket size that's the maximum amount of
traffic that can be sent that exceeds
the sustained rate the maximum sustained
traffic rate is simply Rho as we've
defined it before now suppose that we
wanted to cap the rate that the sender
could send during the power boost window
well all we need to do in that case is
to simply apply a second token bucket
with another value of Rho that token
bucket limits the peak sending rate for
power boost eligible packets to the rate
row C where Rho C is larger than rho
remember that this value of Rho also
affects how quickly tokens can refill in
the bucket so it also plays a role in
the maximum rate that can be sustained
during a power boost window</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
