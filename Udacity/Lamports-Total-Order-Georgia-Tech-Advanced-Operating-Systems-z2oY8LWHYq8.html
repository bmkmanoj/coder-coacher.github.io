and unambiguous decision-making in
distributed system let's now introduce
lamport's total order formulation this
is the notation we're going to use for
lamport's total order and so what we are
saying here is that if there are two
events a and B in the distributed system
a happens to be an event in this case on
P I and B happens to be an event on
process PJ if we want to assert that a
totally is ordered ahead of B that is a
precedes B in the total order this is
true only under the condition that
either the time stamp associated with a
is less than B or the time stamp happens
to be the same and there is some
arbitrary other function that helps us
to an ambiguously decide which event
precedes the other and for instance I
might say that the process ID that I
associated with VI and PJ that may be
the one that I used to break the tie in
my family car example I told you that
the seniority of the family member makes
the decision in terms of how we break
the tie so for instance in this in this
case if process P I has a process ID 100
and process PJ has a process ID 200 then
we could say that the arbitrary decision
making in the case of a tie is that
whichever process has a lower process ID
that's going to be the winner so we
might you might decide that in this case
if time stamp happens to be the same
then since P is less than PJ I'm gonna
say that a precedes B so it's an
arbitrary well-known condition for
breaking a type so every process in the
entire distributed system is going to
use the same well known arbitrary
condition in order to break a type so
that also brings up another interesting
point and that is there is no single
total order the single total order comes
from the choice of the arbitrary well
known condition I gave you this example
of my family car we broke the tie in the
family car situation
by saying that the seniority is the
winner tomorrow as a family we could
make a decision that the youngest person
is gonna win in that case my daughter
will have dibs over the car over
everybody else in the case of a tie the
other important point to understand is
that all of this idea of associating
logical time stamps with events and then
deriving a total order from the logical
time stamp using this kind of a method
of saying we're going to just believe
the time stamp associated with the
respective events we're going to believe
the time stamps that are associated with
the events and use those time stamp as a
way of ordering them so that we can
derive a total order and if it happens
to be a tie everybody uses a well-known
arbitrary condition to break the tie and
that's how we derive a total order and
once we have derived the total order the
time stamps are meaningless after that
we don't care about them anymore
the whole idea of having this logical
time stamps creating a partial order and
from the partial order deriving a total
order using this formulation for total
ordering is so that we can get a
particular total order and once we get
the total order time stamps are
meaningless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
