two editions at this statement then at
this statement it does n over 2 minus 1
additions and finally the ad scan
operates on a problem that's half the
size so what does that mean basically
the recurrence for the total work is
this so the work is linear in n before
moving on to the span let me make a
quick remark I hit a constant in here
what's the constant as it happens the
constant is about 2 now that 2 is
counting only addition operations now
this factor of 2 is pretty interesting I
think about what that means for a sec
the purely sequential algorithm only has
a constant of about 1 so evidently our
parallel algorithm does twice the work
now where in your theory hat that's not
a big deal but it does raise an
interesting and more general question
will you in general need to pay some
sort of price in order to get
parallelism ok boot up enough with the
distractions what about the span now the
first observation is the recursive call
which always operates on a subproblem of
half the size so you'd naturally expect
about oav login levels all the other
operations are data parallel that means
you can implement them using parallel
fours which will also have logarithmic
span putting that together here's what
the recurrence might look like if you
solve the recurrence you will get o of
log squared n again the master theorem
makes solving it quick and easy
alternatively you should be able to see
the log squared end behavior intuitively
there's log and span from the statements
within this function and that's repeated
log n times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
