would you like a really simple model
well of course you would because who
wants a complicated model if you can
have a simple model all right suppose we
just start off with a patch a location
at some point XY all right so we're
going to say all right I've got some
patch at X Y and my dynamics is going to
be random noise so what that means is
that's the same model that they use for
the head contour we're not going to
track velocity we're just going to
assume that the position changes
randomly okay so as you add your
particles you assume zero velocity so
they stay where they are and then just
you would add random noise and then how
about the very simplest of sensor models
okay you just take the mean squared
difference right so what this says is if
I propose that the state of the object
is here and it used to be here I'm just
going to compare the patch I'm literally
going to subtract the two patches and
say what's the mean squared error okay
that would be sort of the simplest
sensor model possible if you do a
slightly more sophisticated one right
you could do a normalized correlation
you've already learned about this when
we did stereo and you could say the
higher the correlation the more likely
or the bigger the sum of the squared
differences the less likely that would
be your sump your sensor model so to do
this all you would need is a patch so
there's a patch so those of you who are
from the United States or no US politics
that's Mitt Romney the reason I'm
showing you this is that we provided to
the students who are going to be doing
problem sets in the original class and
going on the OMS class a video okay and
this is the patched grabbed out of a
section of one of the frames and your
goal is to see with a particle filter
how long can you track mit romney until
he up until it falls off and he loses
the election</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
