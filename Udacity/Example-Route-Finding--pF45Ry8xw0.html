problem maps on to the root founding of
domain first the initial state were
given let's say we start off in Arad and
the goal test let's say that the state
of being in Bucharest is the only state
that counts as a goal and all other
states are not goals now the set of all
the states here is known as the state
space and we navigate the state space by
applying actions the actions are
specific to each city so when we're in
Arad there are three possible actions to
follow this road this one or this one
and as we follow them we build paths or
sequences of actions so just being in a
rod is the path of length zero and now
we could start exploring the space and
add in this path of length 1 this path
of length 1 and this path of length 1 we
can add in another path here of length
to another path here of length 2 here's
another path of length 2 here's a path
of length 3 another path of length 2 and
so on now at every point we want to
separate the state out into three parts
first the ends of the paths the farthest
paths that menemen have been explored we
call the frontier and so the frontier in
this case consists of these states and
the farthest out we've been explored and
then to the left of that in this diagram
we have the explored part of the state
and then off to the right we have the
unexplored so let's write down those
three components we have
the frontier we have the unexplored
region and we have the explored region
one more thing in this diagram we've
labeled the step cost of each action
along the route so the step cost of
going between named AZ would be 87
corresponding to a distance of 87
kilometers and then the path cost is
just the sum of the step costs so the
cost of the path of going from our rod
to oradea be 71 plus 75</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
