more details about what coded
photography could mean here I'm
basically just showing your single image
one photograph of basically some bottle
some cans and a pack of chips if I just
take this one picture what I'd like to
be able to get out of this is basically
some sort of a depth map now we've
looked at how to compute depth and we've
talked about how to compute depth by
taking two images a stereo pair and we
could compute something like this
imagine in one image we can actually now
decode it to be able to get information
that gives you depth in some detail like
this another example we can play with is
where just the same single input image
and allow us to not compute a all
focused image everything in this all
layers of this image are not completely
focused here you can see a little bit of
blurriness in this image because of
defocusing or you know some of this is
also defocused but here each and every
part of it and you can see there are
multiple layers of this one all are
focused you can basically look at a
little bit close up to see what i mean
by this more detail more Christmas at
all levels here this one is of course
defocused</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
