characteristics of the extended file
system let's now consider its merits and
compare it with the fat system file
creation means grabbing an inode and
updating the parent directory this is
not substantially different from fat
file growth just means grabbing a new
data block and updating the inode no big
deal we are still efficient in terms of
space there's a little waste in
potentially unused fields in the AI
nodes and the indirection tables are
space that would not be used if the file
were stored in a fat system but this is
usually going to be small compared to
the whole size of a file as for access
time it is true that the I nodes add an
extra layer of indirection as we go
through the directory tree a directory
points to the inode for a file rather
than to the first date of the block
because I nodes are cached in memory
however this performance cost is minimal
much more important is that the I nodes
link the data blocks together in a tree
like structure with a high branching
factor as many as an indirection table
can hold this makes for much better
random access than one gets from the
linked list chaining of the fat format
at least for large files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
