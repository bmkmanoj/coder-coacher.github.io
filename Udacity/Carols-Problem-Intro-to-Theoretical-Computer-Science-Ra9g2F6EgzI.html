solutions here but the maximum number of
items that Carol can select is at most
three and I'll give you one example of
this so for example she could decide to
invest in the manufacturer which means
she cannot invest in this mining company
here then she could maybe decide to also
invest in this Bank which means she
cannot invest in this mining company
here and then she could also choose one
of those metals here so let's say she
also decides that she's going to invest
in silver but that means that copper and
gold are out of the question and again
she could have also chosen one of the
other possibilities here but three is
really the maximum number of items that
she can select so similar to the problem
that bob was working on this is of
course a bit of a simplification so when
you're working on real world finance
problems you usually have constraints
that are a bit more complicated and also
of course your networks will be much
larger but in essence that's a sort of
problem that you might encounter in
financial modeling and optimization only
a simplified version of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
