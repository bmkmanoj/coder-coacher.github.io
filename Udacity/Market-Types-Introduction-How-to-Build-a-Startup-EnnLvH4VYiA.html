avoiding bringing this up until now but
it's something you as an entrepreneur
should know it's a secret and it's a
secret that we didn't even understand
for a long time and that secret is there
are four types of startups and not
knowing which type you are can really
sink your company so we call this market
type it turns out that there really are
four types of markets for startups one
is an existing market another is where
you take a segment or resegmented
existing market another is a new market
and another is a clone market so let's
take a look why this is important and
then we'll give you the definition of
each one it turns out that the type of
market changes everything
it changes your initial market size how
much it costs to enter the market what
kind of launch you do of your product it
affects the type of competitive barriers
you have and how you position or
describe your product in affects your
sales model are you gonna hire direct
sales when do you hire them what kind of
margins you should have or the profit
how long it takes that is the sales
cycle and something called the chasm
with which we'll take a look in a second
it also affects how much money you're
gonna need to raise and how long it
takes to get to profitability and then
finally it affects the types of
customers and what their needs are and
how long it takes to adopt so one of the
things this looks like is just a
checklist of market type seems to affect
everything what the heck can it be so
let's go a little further into fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
