random testing differs from fuzzing and
the short answer is they're the same
thing
the long answer is gonna require a bit
of explanation so let's go back in time
to 1990 when a professor called Bart
Miller and his students published a
paper called an empirical study of the
reliability of UNIX utilities and so
what they did as part of the fuzzing
effort was provide completely random
data to a bunch of UNIX command line
utilities these were things like editors
terminal programs text processing
utilities another similar UNIX tools
that you can basically think of as being
tools predating the era of graphical
user interfaces on UNIX systems and what
they found is using this incredibly
simple technique that is doing random
testing without worrying at all about
the input validity problem they're able
to crash a quarter to a third of these
utilities on basically any version of
UNIX that they tested and so what you
have here is a pretty strong result they
were able to crash lots of applications
with minimal effort what that means is
that the quality of the input validation
done by these sorts of programs at the
time was really rather bad a few years
later in 1995 the same group repeated
the effort and wrote another paper about
this this time that not only tested the
same kind of utilities that they had
tested five years earlier but they
extended the work to testing network
applications and GUI applications and
basically they got very similar results
now in another five years in 2000 the
same people didn't did another study and
this time they fudged Windows
applications and what they found was
basically more of the same they could
crash most of the applications that they
tested and then finally in 2006 the most
recent installment of a fuzzing study by
this group was published this time they
attacked Mac OSX and this time they
found something a little bit different
the command-line utilities on Mac OSX
were harder to crash they found a much
lower rate of crashes than they had
found earlier but on the other hand have
the 30 GUI apps that they tested 22
could be crashed it's worth mentioning
that as this group of all of their
fuzzing work they kept having to write
new tools for example to fuzz the
Windows applications they had to
generate Windows events to GUI
applications they did do something
similar for Mac OS and previously for X
Windows applications so they had to keep
evolving their tools but the input
generation methodology that they used
that is to say basically generating
random garbage and not really worrying
about the input validity problem
remained the same across all of these
studies so now what I've covered so far
was this particular random testing
effort by this one research group but
something interesting happened I believe
sometime around 2000 are a little after
is the term fuzzing took on another use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
