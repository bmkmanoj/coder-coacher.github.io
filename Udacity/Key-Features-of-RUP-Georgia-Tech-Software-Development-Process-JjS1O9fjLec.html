activities and principles are reflected
in the key features of the rational
unified process first of all the
rational unified process is a software
process model so if you recall our
introductory lessons that means two main
things the first one is that it defines
an order of phases that have to be
followed in the software process and the
second thing is that it also prescribes
transition criteria so when to go from
one phase to the next the second key
feature of RUP is that it is component
based and also in this case this implies
two main things the first one is that a
software system is defined and built as
a set of software components so software
components are the building blocks of
our software system and the second one
is that there must be well-defined
interfaces between these components
interfaces through which these
components communicate in addition the
rational unified process is tightly
related to UML and in particular it
relies extensively on UML for its
notation and with respect to its basic
principles finally the three main
distinguishing aspects of the original
unified process are that it is use case
driven architecture centric and
iterative and incremental so let's now
look in more detail at these three
distinguishing aspects and we're going
to look at each one of them individually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
