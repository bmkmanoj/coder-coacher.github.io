always equivalent to the string s
remember what it means to use the colon
when there's nothing on the left side
means start from the beginning and when
there's nothing on the right side means
go all the way to the end so if there's
nothing on either side
that's selecting the entire string so
the second one's a little trickier but
this also always has the same value as
the string s and the reason is we have
the originals from us and we're
concatenating to it the string s index 0
colon negative 1 plus 1 well negative 1
plus 1 has the value 0 when we index
from 0 : 0 that's an empty string and
the reason that's an empty string is
because we're starting from 0 and we're
stopping just before 0 there are no
characters between 0 and 0 so that's an
empty string adding the empty string to
itself leaves the string empty and the
interesting thing about this is this
works even when s is an empty string if
s was an empty string s index 0 that
would produce an error it's trying to
select the first character from s and
there's no first character since s was
an empty string but s index 12 : 12 even
though there's no twelfth character of s
since there are no characters between
there it's okay
that s doesn't have them that's going to
evaluate to the empty string so the
third one is also always equivalent to s
it's selecting from the beginning of the
string position 0 all the way to the end
again as we saw here even if s has no
characters this is still ok it will give
us the empty string if s has any
characters that will give us all the
characters in s the fourth one is not
equivalent and this might be a little
surprising it sounds like well it's
selecting all the characters from the
beginning to the end because negative 1
is the index of the last character in s
but remember that the selection stops
before the last character so what this
dual will do will give us every
character besides the last one so let's
see that in the Python interpreter we're
going to print s index colon negative 1
and this will give us all the characters
except for the last one so the final one
is the most surprising that this
actually is always equivalent to s it's
equivalent even if s has fewer
and three characters so the first part
is selecting all the characters from the
beginning up to position three not
including position three and then we're
concatenating that with all of the
characters of s from position three to
the end if s has less than three
characters well this is going to be
empty there are no characters from
position three to the end but that's
okay we're going to add the empty string
to the characters before position three
so here's how that works in the Python
interpreter we'll do s from position
beginning to index three and add that to
s index three to the end that produces
the same string and if we do this with a
shorter string let's initialize two to
be the string high we can print from T
to position three plus from T from
position three to the end we don't get
an error we get the string high out so
this indexing subsequences is very
resilient it works even when we index
positions that don't exist in the string
this is different from when we were
doing indexing of particular positions
by themselves if we did index T index
three that will give us an error because
there's no character at position three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
