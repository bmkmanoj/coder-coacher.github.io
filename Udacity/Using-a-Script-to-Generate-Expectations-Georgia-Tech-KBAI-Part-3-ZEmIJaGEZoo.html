a while back let's look into it more
deeply so when we actually interact with
the world sometimes things do not happen
the way we expect them to happen and
sometimes things happen that we were not
expecting but how do we know what to
expect and what not to expect so
consider a situation like this this is
an instance of a script in this
particular case I have gone to olive
garden and the waiter is Andrew so I've
moved to a table and sit down at the
table and now Andrew sees me so from my
perspective we're expecting and due to
come to me and give me a menu but
supposing this never happens now I'm
sitting there waiting where Andrew or
some other someone else to come and no
one comes that's an expectation
violation so I know something has gone
awry the reason I know that is because I
can generate expectations using the
scripts expectations that I never
fulfilled now consider alternative
situation instead of Andrew coming to my
table and giving me a menu Andrew comes
to me and gives me a bill right away
well I should think that I would be
surprised by that that was an unexpected
event that occurred well several
questions arise here first could this be
the beginning of a theory of surprise in
both cases we were surprised in one case
when Andrew did not come and give a menu
and the second case when Andrew came and
gave a bill instead of giving the menu
and second notice that surprised it has
two sides to it one when things do not
happen the way we expect him to happen
and the other when things happen the way
in which we were not expecting them to
happen this example shows the scripts
not only allow us to make sense of the
world around us they also tell us what
to expect and what not to expect and
that's a very powerful idea so it seems
like another example where this happens
really strongly that we encounter fairly
frequently is if you've ever seen a
horror movie one thing that horror
movies really do really really well is
they lure you into expecting one thing
to happen only this or something
completely different at you so they lure
you into kind of a false sense of
security and expecting that nothing bad
is going to happen in a particular scene
and then suddenly they throw a ghost at
you from off screen it kind of startles
you and the reason it startles you is
because it violates your expectations
for what we're going to happen
text David that's a good point it
happens in many different kinds of
movies so when I go and see a
science-fiction movie or even a romance
movie I'm expecting certain things to
happen and sometimes I think a movie is
really good if it is new and novel and
different it offers some surprising
things notice that this could also be
the beginning of a theory of creativity
in the last lesson we were talking about
bugs and humor now we are talking about
surprises some current theories of
creativity say that a situation is
creative if it is a novel be if it is
useful or valuable and subway and see if
it is unexpected or surprising now this
begins to capture it at least one of
those three dimensions of unexpectedness
of surprise and that's an important part
we return the computational creativity
at the end of this course when we talk a
lot more about these issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
