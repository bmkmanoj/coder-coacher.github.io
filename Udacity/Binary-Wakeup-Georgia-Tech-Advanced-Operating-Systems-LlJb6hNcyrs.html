is a binary wakeup tree once again here
there is a theoretical result that backs
this particular choice that the shortest
critical path from the root to the last
awakened child is shortest when you have
a binary wakeup tree and that's the
reason that they've chosen to have this
construction even though the arrival
tree is a four ready tree the
construction for the wakeup tree is a
binary tree and let me explain the
construction of this binary wakeup tree
every processor is assigned a unique
spot again so p0 at the root and p1 p2
over here p3 p4 p5 p6 and p7 so that
completes the eight processors for this
binary tree set up for wakeup and the
data structure that is used in the
wakeup tree is as a child pointer planar
structure and the child pointer data
structure is essentially a way by which
a parent can reach down to the children
and indicate that that it is time to
wake up so that's the purpose of this
child pointer data structure and once
again as you can see depending on the
particular location in this wakeup tree
they may have children they may not have
children so p0 has two children p1 has
two children P 3 and P 4 P 2 has two
children P 5 and P 6 P 3 has one child P
7 and that is it because we have eight
processors and there were these guys
don't have any children p4 p5 and p6 so
in terms of wakeup what is going to
happen is that when everybody has
arrived at the barrier p0 is going to be
noticing it in through the arrival tree
and so now it says oh it's time now to
wake up everybody and the way it does
that it has a specific pointer to reach
into p1 and signal to p1 that it's time
to wake up
and similarly it has a specific point in
in p2 to wake up so a particular memory
location which is a pointer to a
location that this guy is waiting on to
wake up so it's going to do that and so
what is going on is that
this is another important point that in
order to to know that it is time to wake
up each one of these processes is
spending on a statically determined
location p2 is spending on a particular
location here and and p1 is spending on
a particular location here and so when
p0 signals p1 it is exactly sending a
signal to p1 and and it is not affecting
any of the other processes and similarly
when it signals p2 it signals exactly p2
using this pointer and similar it once
p1 and p2 are woken up they can march
down the tree and signal p3 and p4 and
signal p5 and p6 by using the the
statically assigned spots that the
children are spinning on to indicate
that it is time to wake up so the key
point I want to stress again is the fact
that in this construction of the tree by
design we make sure that we know a
position in the tree and we know exactly
thus the memory location that we have to
spin on in order to know that it is time
to wake up so these red arrows show the
specific location that is associated
with each one of these processes in the
wakeup tree so once the parents signal
the children and they march down and
signal all the other children then at
that point everybody is awake and the
barrier has been reached so the key
takeaway points with the MCH tree
barrier is that the wakeup tree is
binary the arrival tree is for every and
there are static locations associated
with each processor both in the arrival
tree that we saw earlier and the wakeup
tree and through this specific
statically assigned spot that each
processor can spin on we are making sure
that the amount of contention on the
network is limited and also by packing
the variables into a single data
structure we can make sure that the
contention for shared locations is
minimized as much as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
