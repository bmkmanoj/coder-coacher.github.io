one-way anova like this our F statistic
as a function of our two degrees of
freedom between and within our p-value
and eight is squared
note that when we're doing ANOVA by hand
we can't find the exact p-value this is
the same as with the T tests we only
know that our p-value is less than point
zero five our alpha level because our F
statistic is greater than the F critical
value if we're using software it'll be
the same thing except we can calculate
the exact p-value notice that we've
frequently used small samples in our
examples and problem sets
however we wouldn't normally use such
small samples especially in real
research but if we use large samples we
can't do ANOVA by hand that would just
take too long we would use software
instead when we use software we don't
care as much about the intermediate
steps really we just want to compare the
p-value with alpha we know that if P is
less than alpha will reject the null
since using software is so essential to
doing statistical tests we're going to
provide you with some software output
for you to see and analyze so that you
get familiar with it this is real data
that dr. Laraway collected from his
psychology students at San Jose State
University there are 188 students total
90 of which were freshmen 44 sophomores
23 juniors and 31 seniors and he asked
them to self-report how many days every
month they drink caffeine you can
already see that the number of days that
seniors drink caffeine is higher than
any of the others but it also has a
pretty large standard deviation as does
that for juniors we want to know if at
least one group of college students
drinks more caffeine than the others dr.
Lara I used the statistical program SPSS
to answer this
here's his ANOVA table output according
to this which of the following would we
do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
