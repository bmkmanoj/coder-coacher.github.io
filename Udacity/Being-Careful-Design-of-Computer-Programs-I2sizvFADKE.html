made a mistake and and I haven't talked
about this very much over the course of
these lectures but I'm making mistakes
all the time and I know you guys are you
type something in it doesn't work i have
the same problem over and over again I
keep making mistakes and that's fine as
long as I know how to correct them here
the mistake I made is the mechanical
mistake was I I messed up and I typed
the wrong function at one point so i
think these function names are too
similar they made a mistake in naming
them max diffs and and wind if they
sound too much alike and when I was
playing with this I put in the utility
function where I meant to put in the
strategy function that's an easy mistake
to make because they sound the same
probably actually I should have come up
with better names I should have called
this wind if utility or something like
that to make it clear that this is a
utility function and this is a strategy
function but the annoying thing was is
that that mistake went unnoticed for a
while and I'll show you part of the
problem here's the play pig function it
takes two strategies a and B these have
to be strategy functions and then it
comes down here and it applies the
appropriate strategy function to a state
and it says if that strategy function
decides to hold then we do the hold
action otherwise well there's only two
actions you could do so I'll do the roll
action I make sense right now here's the
problem if instead of passing in a
strategy function you accidentally pass
in a utility function then that's all
good down here you say strategies of P
applied to state and that's really
applying a utility function to state
what's the utility function going to
return well it's going to return a
number and play pig just says well as
that number equal to hold no it's not no
numbers are equal to hold so then I'm
just going to assume that you meant roll
and so the fact that I passed in a
completely wrong function that's doing
nothing related to strategy it's
returning a number rather than an action
went completely unnoticed and instead
what my strategy was the utility
function that returns a number acted as
if it was a strategy function that oh is
that role now in general that's one of
the complaints
that people have about Python is that
it's too easy to make that mistake
because you don't have to declare for
each function what are its inputs and
what are its outputs in other languages
you would do that and the program where
you accidentally used in a utility
function where you expected a strategies
function that program wouldn't even
compile you get an error message before
you run it in Python you don't have that
protection so you got to build in the
protection yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
