you know the answer is yeah I think you
know you asked it in a funny way but I
think what you're asking maybe was
pretty simple so let me let me see if I
can talk it through so we've got n data
points each learner is a zeroth order
polynomial so that you you said the
ensemble rule is that you learn over a
subset a zeroth order polynomial is just
that well we said that the thing that
minimizes the average sorry the
minimizes the expected error or the
squared error zeroth order polynomial
it's just the average so if the sets are
n distinct sets with one data point each
then each of the individual learners is
just going to learn the average then
they get not the average sorry the
actual output value of each individual
point is the average and then the
combining algorithm to combine all the
pieces that ensemble into one answer
combines with the mean so it's going to
combine the mean of those each of which
is the data point so it's the mean of
the data points so the ensemble outputs
I don't know I'd say average or mean yes
or zeroth order polynomial of the
dataset or you know one no decision Qi
or a constant which happens to be the
mean of the data haven't we seen this
before
it seems to come up a lot when we are
outputting very simple hypotheses right
and the last time we did this if I
recall correctly this is what happens if
you do an unweighted average with K n
where K is equal to n oh right like like
right and end and end in and in
so we should probably do something a
little smarter than this then and I
thought that we might look at some of
the housing data because no one started
looking at the housing data yet okay so
let's look at that right quick and see
if we can figure out how this works and
then see if we can do something a little
bit better even better than that okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
