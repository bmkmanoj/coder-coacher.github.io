practiced gives us m is greater than or
equal to 333 and one-third let's look at
this on a number line so M can be
anything to the right of or including
333 and a third but wait what are we
talking about anyway what was Emmy quell
to M is equal to the number of deluxe
wipers sold now you can't sell a third
of a wiper set that means we're going to
have to make em into a whole number and
we make it 333 then we won't quite make
it to our twenty thousand dollar profit
level so that means we're going to have
to round up em has to be greater than
equal 2 334 wipers well i'm going to
leave our number line looking just like
this because this would be about in the
same place you can just imagine that our
bracket has shifted slightly to the
right what we want is the minimum
possible value for M so the smallest
value in this range of possible
solutions that of course is going to be
just this end point solution 334 exactly
so we want m equals 334</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
