going to perfectly balanced each other
out we know that the electric force is
going to exactly equal the gravitational
force and we know the formulas for both
of these forces so we can put those in
and you'll see that the distance between
the two particles immediately cancels
out and the charges for both of our
particles are both 1 Coulomb so we know
that this product of charges is just
going to be equal to 1 so I'm just going
to cross it out and since both of these
two particles have the same mass we know
that the product m1 m2 here is just
equal to M Squared this gives us the
equation k equals G M Squared and
solving for M here we find that the mass
has to be equal to the square root of K
over g which plugging in our known
values for these two constants we get
that the mass has to be one point one
six times ten to the tenth kilograms and
that is a really large mass to give you
something to compare this to this is
about twice the mass of one of the
Egyptian pyramids and that's just if our
particles have a charge of one Coulomb
so to balance out the electric force
between two particles with a relatively
small charge we need a giant mass and
this tells us one of two things either
that the gravitational force is really
really really weak in comparison to the
electric force or most of the masses we
deal with in everyday life are really
really really small either way it helps
us put these two forces in perspective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
