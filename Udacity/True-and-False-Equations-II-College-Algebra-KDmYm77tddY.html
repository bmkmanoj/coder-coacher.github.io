equation starting with this one up here
log base 10 of 100 is 2 + log base 10 of
1,000 is 3 so we have 2 over 3 for this
side on the right-hand side we have log
base 10 of 100 again or two and then
minus 34 log base 10 of 1000 this equals
negative 1 unfortunately for this
equation two thirds is not equal to
negative 1 so this is not a true
statement I need to put a not equal sign
here let's move over here to this
equation the left-hand side right now is
log base 10 of 100 over 1000 so let's
look at what's inside the parentheses
and simplify that 100 over 1000 is 1
over 10 and 1 over 10 is the same as 10
to the negative 1 log base 10 of 10 to
the negative 1 is just negative 1 great
what about the right-hand side well this
is the same as what we had over here and
we got negative 14 that sure enough
negative 1 is equal to negative 1 so
this equation is true awesome now what
about this last one here well once again
let's start with what's inside the
parentheses here we have log base 10 of
100 minus 1000 which is the same as log
base 10 of negative 900 hmm I'm not sure
what this is so how about I pull out the
calculator and we'll see what this
equals so we have log base 10 of
negative nine hundred and look at that
we get an error I wonder why that is
well actually we know why we're trying
to take the log of a negative number and
you learn before that that is not
allowed this is just not equal to a real
number on the right hand side we have
what we had over here two thirds well
two thirds is a real number so that
means this equation is not true the
second one log base 10 of 100 over 1000
is equal to log base 10 of 100 minus log
base 10 of 1000 is the only example of
the quotient rule being used properly of
these three equations this is a great
check to show that the quotient property
actually works and i hope it's also
pointed out some easy ways that you
might accidentally make a mistake when
you're trying to
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
