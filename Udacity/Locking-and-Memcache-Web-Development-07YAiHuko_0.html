Cassandra for the precompute stuff and
that solved the right contention issue
at that point there's still the every
listing has a Lock you have to locking
lick you so you have this listing which
is a set of ID's of all of the the links
in a subreddit right and you have to
modify that you have to lock around that
item and that's at the subreddit levels
so if a lot of people are hanging out
and once I've read it that thing will
have a lot of locking going on so we
talked a little bit just in the office
hours I think for unit 4 some of
somebody had asked about in data store
if two users try to register the same
username at the same time and that store
doesn't enforce any uniqueness
constraints on a field and that is how
do you know how do you manage that and
my answer was you can use use either
news transactions in the data store
which I don't fully understand because
I'm new to the data store or you can use
memcached
which is you know one of the 101 uses of
memcache this is like this global lock
so you guys are moving away from that
yes when you use memcache as a locking
service the problem is is that if you
lose a single memcache node then you
lose the site because you can't throw
away that node without potentially your
like say say half the apps can't see a
memcache node and the others can so the
ones that don't see it decide that
they're not going to talk to that guy
anymore and they try to lock on a
different set of servers when we store
data on multiple nodes in Cassandra it's
different from how we store that across
different nodes in memcache which is
correct me if I'm wrong when you
distribute across memcache you basically
hash your key to a particular memcache
box and there's no notion of replication
yeah it's it's similar in Cassandra it's
the this node has a key space and it
just happens to go plus one and minus
one and you can do the same you can do
replication like that in memcache as
well now were you guys using
when when I left we were using a naive
memcache library that basically took a
key and said you know which boxes this
hash to and would store it on that box
and if you lost that box it would affect
the hashing of every other key which was
like losing a man cashbox was really
painful so we'd replicate memcache is
for mostly space so we have more space
things wouldn't expire out of the cache
fast enough or wouldn't wouldn't expire
out of cache too fast but that had the
big downside up that we lost a single
memcache box all of the keys would get
rearranged right so yeah that modulo
hashing we are using consistent hashing
now and the way that works is it
basically builds up this a ring similar
to this and instead of mapping you know
like keys 1 through a thousand to this
box it actually sort of assigns them to
a place on a circle and finds the
nearest server on that circle and so
when this node fails it'll go to the
next one and so only like you know we we
have 10 nodes we lose one only 1/10 of
your keys get redistributed yeah so if
you're using consistent hashing a key
might have to like this space on the
circle right and if you lose this guy
the key still goes in that space but all
the keys over here stay active same spot
right yeah when you're using modular
fashion remember we talked about modulo
in unit 6 and that's a really naive way
to distribute keys if all of sudden you
go from you know modulo 10 because you
have 10 service module 9 yeah
only instead of losing 1/10 of your keys
you lose nine-tenths of your keys that's
a big cup you actually had this happen a
couple times while I was there yeah you
lose one map cache box or more likely
you miss configure it and the app server
results see it anymore
all of a sudden your cache is not warm
anymore and you've got user sore just
like hitting the databases pummeling the
hard cash or the memcache stickies we
call it the hard cash and all of a
sudden your load profile completely
changes and everything explodes so that
was a really nice improvement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
