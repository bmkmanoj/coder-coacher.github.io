this unit is trying to understand the
cost of running programs so far we
haven't really worried about this we've
been very happy to write code if we get
the correct result that's a great thing
but once we start making programs bigger
worrying about programs that do more
things running on larger inputs we have
to start thinking about the cost of
running our programs and this question
of what it costs to evaluate an
execution is a very important problem in
computer science in some sense it's one
of the most fundamental problems many
people spend their whole careers working
on this and it's a problem called
algorithm analysis I haven't yet
explained what an algorithm is but
you've actually written many of them
already so an algorithm is a procedure
that always finishes a procedure is just
a well defined sequence of steps it has
to be defined precisely enough that it
could be executed mechanically so to be
a procedure it has to be something that
can be executed without any thought and
we're mostly interested in procedures
that can be executed by computers but
the important part of what makes it a
procedure is that the steps are very
precisely defined and don't require any
thought to execute to be an algorithm it
has to always finish and we've pointed
out already that this is a very tough
problem to figure out whether a program
will finish in general it's not possible
to answer that question but for many
specific programs it is and in order for
a program to be an algorithm we have to
know that it always finishes and it
always produces the correct result so
once we have an algorithm well we know
we have a well-defined sequence of steps
so it can reason about what will happen
on any input and we know that it we will
always finish and always produce the
correct result so then we can think
about what the cost is of executing that
algorithm on some input so how should we
think about cost and the way computer
scientists think about costs is quite
different from how most people think
about cost so if you're normally
thinking about cost well you've got a
specific object let's say you've got a
cool car this is supposed to be a cool
car doesn't quite look like a cool car
and it's got a cost associated with them
let's say that's a
twenty-five-thousand-dollar car and you
have some other car so you have one car
it's got a particular cost that's what
it cost you to get that car you could
have another car that would be smaller
and green and let's say that car cost
ten thousand dollars and when we think
about the cost of things normally we
have very specific things and they have
specific costs and we know that the red
car costs twenty-five thousand dollars
the green car cost ten thousand dollars
the red car cost more than the green car
we just need to compare those costs so
when we think about the cost of
algorithms we don't have a specific
execution in mind usually what we want
to understand is how the cost depends on
the input so we might have two different
algorithms let's say this is algorithm
one and we have a second algorithm that
solves the same problem and both of
these are algorithms that take inputs
and produce output and if we want to
decide which algorithm is better well we
don't have a specific cost for the
algorithm the way we do for the cars and
we can say the red car cost more than
the green car the cost depends on the
actual input that we run the algorithm
on so it might be the case for some
inputs algorithm one is faster and for
other inputs algorithm to is faster and
I should label this algorithm to so what
we need to understand is how the cost of
executing the algorithm depends on the
input we don't want to do that for every
specific input right if we had to do
that for every input well we might as
well just run it on the input and see
what it costs what we want to do is be
able to predict this without actually
having to run it on every input normally
there isn't that much that matters about
the specific input the main thing that's
going to matter about the input is the
size of input that's not always going to
be the case and we'll see examples where
other properties of the input matter but
the primary way that we talk about cost
in computer science is based on the size
of the input as the size of the input
increases how does the cost to evaluate
the procedure increase so cost
ultimately always comes down to money
and when it comes down to money well
what are the things that cost money when
we execute algorithms and the main
things that cost money are the time it
takes to finish if we get an answer more
quickly well we've spent less time on it
we can also rent computers by the time
to execute there are lots of cloud
computing services now that will give
you a processor of the certain power for
a certain amount of time for a certain
number of cents per hour so time really
is money and so we don't need to turn
our cost estimates into money because we
don't necessarily know how much our
computing costs will be but if we can
understand the time it takes to execute
that'll give us a good sense of the cost
the other main cost is often memory so
if we know that we need a certain amount
of memory to be able to execute our
algorithm well that tells us something
about the size of computer we need and
how expensive that's going to be so we
don't usually talk about cost in terms
of dollars when we analyze algorithms
we're talking about cost in terms of
time and memory but those things in real
implementations end up being cost in
terms of dollars so we're mostly going
to focus on measuring time and time is
usually the most important cost of
running an algorithm memory is often
another consideration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
