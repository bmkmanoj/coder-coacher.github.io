when you navigate to Witter the browser
makes a request for some HTML like all
web requests this goes via the browser's
HTTP cache and if there's no match there
it continues on to the Internet then
hopefully the response makes its way
back to the browser the HTML the browser
received tells it it needs some CSS so
that's fetched once that arrives we get
our first render a page full of content
you see the initial set of posts er are
right there in the HTML but at the same
time the browser downloaded the CSS it's
also requesting some JavaScript and when
that arrives it opens a web socket a
persistent connection that lets the
server continually stream newer posts as
they arrive this provides the live
updates so the user doesn't miss out on
a single piece of nonsense posted by the
other users in terms of the pages
JavaScript you'll find that in public
Jay s main the starting point is
index.js
but all this does its load polyfills
that some browsers may need such as
promises and the URL API which we'll use
a little bit later on the main work
happens in index controllers is the
constructor here is run for every page
load we have this post view which helps
us update the post on the page this
toasts view helps us display error
messages hopefully we won't get too many
of those and then we open a socket
connection the open socket method well
as you might guess opens the web socket
and the message event is fired when data
is received for new posts to display
when you post the received on socket
message is called this method passes the
data as JSON and passes the result to
the post view while the server is
running any changes you make to these
files will be processed and built I
didn't want the s6 to be a prerequisite
for this course so I'm gonna stick to es
5 but a build system uses Babel so if
you're like a cool kid from the future
feel free to use some of the latest
JavaScript syntax oh and I almost forgot
there's actually another server running
on port 8080 8 9 so open that up this
gives you basic control over your
connectivity to the server have a play
with the settings refresh the page and
see how it responds you'll see things
are pretty bad and everything except
perfect
mode and over the course of this course
we're going to fix the non perfect cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
