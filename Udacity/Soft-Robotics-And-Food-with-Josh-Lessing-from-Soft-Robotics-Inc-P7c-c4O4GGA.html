need to think about there's the physical
properties that you need to drive in the
materials to survive the application
itself the the heat the you know all all
the things are not in an internment
there's the materials aspects of
surviving the maintenance operations
cleaning being a good example use also
the material selection that you need to
do to make sure that you don't alter the
part for post-processing steps so let's
say I'm handling a metal part that
subsequently is going to go through a
coating or painting step you need to
make sure that the materials that you
select don't leave residues that poorly
interact with downstream chemistry's so
all of this goes into creating the
appropriate material selection for soft
robot so all manner of food is a
fantastic application for us so if you
think about it there's no such thing for
example as a regular piece of broccoli
you know when food comes down a conveyor
needs to be packaged every piece even
though they may look the same to a human
to a robot small degrees of variability
can ruin an application at least for a
conventional system so you know every
piece of food varies a little bit in
size weight shape many pieces of food
are remarkably easy to damage I'm proud
to say that our creepers actually do
less damage then you might yourself just
handling a piece of food so you need to
be able to offer that the ability to be
delicate and then on top of it you need
to be very very clean of all so going
back to the the terminator hand idea if
I have a terminator hand I have
gazillion little crevices all over the
surface and if you have crevices you
can't clean it fundamentally you know
when you talk about bacterial harborage
of e.coli Salmonella you know if you
have a few only a few cells left in a
surface that's more than enough to
actually create later on a foodborne
illness outbreak so our structures are
fundamentally different right we have
continuous elastomeric bladders that are
mating typically into plastic and steel
hub assemblies
that allow you to create a hand
structure that's incredibly dexterous
dexterous like those Terminator style
hands but at simultaneously have almost
no crevices on the surface so that you
can clean it out and it will be very
very safe and at the same time we are
also since you know material science is
a big part of what we do here we can
select for things like all FDA approved
materials or whatever is the material
safety standard that you want to hit we
can build that into our systems so that
you can build incredibly clean safe
robotic systems in ways that you
normally couldn't with normal
technologies and it's very exciting
something came into effect a few years
back the Food Safety Modernization Act
it is the biggest overhaul in the
regulatory infrastructure that guides
the creation of food in about 70 years
and it was in response to some pretty
horrific and dangerous outbreaks of
bacteria in people's food and so the US
government has really focused on how to
bring us all safer food and one of the
ways you can do that is with a robotic
system so if I have you know one of our
grippers which is incredibly cleanable
and I do that in a process where the
washing of that system is automated as
well and I surround it with other pieces
of infrastructure again very cleanable
you can start building you start
building robotic food factories that
always deliver a safe product that you
can rely on so you can do gripper swamps
with our systems many of the
applications that we work in you don't
and the reason why is is that because we
offer adaptive gripping you can grab
many many different grasses targets with
a single structure which is technically
impressive but also delivers incredible
value to customers so in one particular
application we're moving dough balls
that are being rolled into rolled and
need to be moved onto cooling trays
before they drive out to pizzerias and
the customer that we were working with
when they took a traditional mechanical
approach they were building there was
five different sized dough balls so they
were building five different size
mechanical rippers gripper swap gripper
saw
rip or swap and so that adds complexity
that adds cost with our systems they're
able to grab all five sets of dough
balls all with a single construct
because again you just inflate until it
makes contact with the surface and the
pneumatics and the ways in which the
elastomers and the plastics work it
innately finds the correct grip on what
is an incredibly deformable and
invariable grass target if you ever play
around with dough you'll notice that you
know when it sits on a table it slowly
rolls out so it shapes changing as it
the water evaporates off the surface it
goes from sticky to slippery if you try
to lay hands on it you'll swish right
through it so it's this incredibly
complex grass target provided a really
fun challenge to solve and because of
the adaptability of our technology we
were actually able to sell them one
gripper that did all five you know
what's what's better is to do one
gripper they can do many different sizes
and shapes and you know ultimately
that's because you don't have turnover
times you know says there's the cost
aspect if you don't have to buy so much
gear but you also don't have if you
every time you do a gripper swap that
robots not doing work so if you can get
a gripper that's hyper adaptable then
the robots always doing work regardless
of what's coming down the conveyer and
being presented to it food work is
interesting because a lot of these jobs
you know people in robotics always talk
about robots doing the dull the dirty
the dangerous jobs so you know think
about what it's like to work in a
chicken factory for example you know
it's a refrigerator like temperatures at
your work place it's a very wet
environment you typically are bounded
and all sorts of smocks and and whatnot
because there's chicken goop everywhere
and you're working around a lot with
just cutters to to to work work the the
work part the meat and so this is a
dirty job it's very repetitive it's a
dull job and it can be a very very
dangerous job in a very inhospitable
environment so being able to offer
solutions that can satisfy those needs
and make sure
people have good clean food on their
table is it's exciting for us it's very
very promising application as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
