through our preparatory activity you've
done some reading on the difference
between experts and novices and met this
idea of the learning objective now we're
going to go over some examples and
evaluate them for quality then we'll
come up with some tasks some perspective
shifts and then you will create a
learning objective for a lesson that you
may actually teach on to the examples so
let's say you're asked to teach
multiplication two students who've never
seen it before
let's go through for potential learning
objectives from what I would say is
worst to best first students will
understand multiplication to me this is
a useless learning objective it uses
this vague term understand and offers me
no insight into what students are
actually going to do with their
knowledge this will not help me inform
any of the design decisions I go on to
make later what about this students will
correctly multiply to one digit numbers
this is definitely better it does tell
me the scope of the task to one digit
numbers that the students will be asked
to perform and the task seems reasonable
for where the students are at if they're
just learning multiplication and it's
aligned to something experts do they
actually do correctly multiply to one
digit numbers when they need to but it
doesn't give me any insight into what's
going on in the students brain for all I
know students may be using calculators
to do this what's actually changing in
their mind that allows them to multiply
to one to two numbers let's look at
another one objective students see the
multiplication table as a useful tool
and they solve a certain number of
problems in a certain amount of time
with a certain amount of accuracy you
know you could actually argue that this
is worse than the previous learning
objective well this last one didn't give
me any insight into what the students
new perspective would be this one does
they see the multiplication table as a
useful tool but it actually specifically
is articulating a terrible perspective
to have yes maybe it is a useful tool
but that's not what we want to change in
their brain we want them to see numbers
differently we want to build expertise
if I were using this objective to
informed as
decisions I'd probably go down the route
of memorization this is not building a
schema that will continue to be useful
in the future
in fact it's building a schema more like
this or this about how numbers interact
rather than a more deep rich network of
connections which is what we want to
create so let's go on to the fourth
learning objective here students are
seeing the multiplication symbol as an
instruction to repeat they solve one
digit multiplication problems so same
task as before but now it's even more
specific they're drawing grids of dots
so three times two would be two rows of
three dots and then the students are
counting the number of dots for a
student who is just learning how to
multiply this seems like a great
learning objective it articulates a very
clear task and even though experts don't
actually count dots it's building a
schema that is consistent with how
experts see multiplication it really is
an instruction to repeat and this is a
great way to start driving that point
home
additionally or as with memorization
these students who have been out of luck
if asked to solve 272 times 49 in theory
students could still draw a very big
grid of dots but by then they'll
probably be ready for a different
approach which will be a perfect
opportunity to teach them the standard
algorithm for multiplying larger numbers
so take a look at these four different
options for a learning objective on a
multiplication lesson what can we
generalize what are the qualities of a
good learning objective take them into
think about it for yourself and then
I'll show you what I think makes for a
great learning objective in general</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
