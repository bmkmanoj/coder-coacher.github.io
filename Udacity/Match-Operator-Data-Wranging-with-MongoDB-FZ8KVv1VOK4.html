some of the aggregation operators we
just touched on now you just had a quiz
on this question we're going to look at
first the dollar match operator and then
the dollar project operator in the
context of this question so the question
is who has the highest followers to
friends ratio the data that we're
working with is from the version 1.1
Twitter API and here friends means who
I'm following so another way of
expressing this is who has the highest
followers to following ratio okay so
here's our complete solution to
addressing this problem using the
aggregation framework let's take a look
at how the match operator is used here
in this first stage of the pipeline now
as I mentioned match is a filtering
operation and something that's very
important to bear in mind it really
clears things up I think with match is
that for match for the value of the
match operator you use the same syntax
that you would use for find operations
or read operations so in this case what
we're specifying is constraints on the
type of document that we want to allow
through this match stage what we're
saying here is I only want to consider
those who have both a friend's count and
a followers count that's greater than
zero and if you think back to when we
were talking about queries in the last
lesson you can see that all we're really
doing here is specifying a specific
field in each case and then using an
inequality operator to express a
constraint on the value for first
friends count and then followers count
and in fact match functions very
similarly to find as part of the
aggregation framework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
