yeah yeah this is the way I was thinking
about it was essentially well for the
theta min wait so we're maximizing right
yes
all right so theta max then is going to
be the largest value that F can return
yep which is actually the optimum of the
function so that probability
distribution assigns a probability of
well one if there's a unique optimum
it'll decided probably of one to that
single point that's exactly right
but you were getting at something else
when you said if there's one optimum
what if there are multiple optimum then
its uniform over all of them right so it
is the distribution that generates only
optimal points so it's the distribution
over Optima which is just what you said
and we'd accept optimum point or
anything that sort of captured this idea
okay
okay what about theta submit so if it's
the minimum value that the function can
achieve then it ought to be the case
that everything in the space of X's is
part of that so it should assign uniform
probability to all points in the input
space that's exactly right so it is in
fact simply the uniform distribution
nice now this is going to be pretty cool
because in this in this slide right here
we basically have the mimic algorithm
I'm not seeing it well I'm about to tell
you we are basically going to try to
estimate this particular distribution
pea-soup theta of X we're going to start
out with piece of theta min piece of
data min of X which is the uniform
distribution so we're going to sample
uniformly from all of the points and
then somehow use those points to do
better and better and better and better
estimates until we get from uniform to a
distribution over only the optimal
points and that's the basic idea so okay
so and the first one being something
that's really easy to sample from
because we're just sampling uniformly
from the input space right and the
second being something that be really
useful to sample from because if we
could sample from the set of Optima it's
really easy to find an optimum exactly
so we're start out here and we're the
goal is to start out here and then to
end up here and so let's actually write
out an algorithm that does that yeah
that's not an algorithm that's just a
goal but many algorithms start out as
goals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
