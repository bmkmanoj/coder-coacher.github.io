is called roadblock roadblock is a game
for two players it's played on a graph
with n vertices where the edges are
colored and coloring well it's in a way
it's similar to shortest tours so in
shortest tour or traveling salesman each
Edge had a number or distance assigned
to it and here each Edge has a color so
you can have red edges blue edges yellow
edges any number of colors that you
desire and each edge has exactly one of
those colors now some of the vertices
also have a label some of the vertices
have a label that says player one wins
and others have a label that says player
2 wins
so the situation might look something
like this so here's the graph with n
vertices in this case 11 vertices the
edges are colored either red purple or
blue when some of the vertices are
labeled here we have the two vertices
let's say player one wins and here we
have two vertices let's say player two
wins
so what are the rules of the game both
player one and player two start out with
a number of playing pieces that are also
specified in the beginning so each
player has a number of pieces at
specified vertices so in this example
I'm drawing here it might look something
like this so player 2 might have a piece
here player 1 might have a piece here
player 2 gets another piece down here
and player 1 gets another piece so
player 1 starts playing then player 2
moves then again player 1 so they play
in turns and here are the rules of the
game in any turn you can take one of
your pieces and move it along the edges
of the graph but you can only move your
piece along edges that have the same
color so you can choose the color but
you must say on that color so for
example player 1 could move this piece
here either to this vertex down here or
this one down here or this one over here
that would all be fine player 2 here for
example could even travel two edges in
one turn or three edges so one two three
because they're all red but what player
2 could not do is travel one two three
because then the color of the edges will
change along which player 2 travels each
time you have a move you can change your
color but not during a move and there's
a second rule and that is you cannot
jump over other pieces so player one
here for example cannot
travel along these red edges here
because player two has a piece here and
that is why it's basically called
roadblock because player two is blocking
this road here for player one
but of course player one could go here
or here how do you win this game that is
very simple player one wins the game if
player one manages to place one of his
or her pieces on a vertex that says
player one wins and player two likewise
wins when player two places his or her
pieces on one of the vertices that say
player two wins it can be any graph any
combination of labels of the vertices
any edges any color combinations of the
edges so you're given this configuration
here as an input the question is can
player one always win or in other words
can player one force a win and what I
mean by that is player one being able to
force a win means that no matter how
smart player 2 plays what moves he or
she makes how intelligent and what not
player 1 will always be able to make
moves that will allow player 1 to win so
given this graph up here can player 1
always win</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
