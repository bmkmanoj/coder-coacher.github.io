which would be correct there are three
digits if n is 100 count will end up as
two which is not the correct number of
digits the loop condition should
actually be while temp is greater than
or equal to ten we can see this by hand
tracing the code the values I'm
interested in our account and temp if n
starts out as 123
then count will start as 1 temp will
start as 123 temp is greater than 10 so
we increment count and divide temp by 10
and divide temp by 10 point 0 which will
give us 12 point 3 now we go back to the
loop condition temp is still greater
than 10 so we increment the count and
then divide temp by 10 point 0 again so
we have 1 point 2 3 now when we check
again temp is less than 10 so we skips
the end and we're done
but what would happen if n was 100 count
would start as 1 the way it did before
in temp would start as 100 temp is
greater than 10 so we would increment
count and then divide temp by 10 point 0
so we would have 10 and then check the
condition again but this time 10 is not
greater than 10 its equal so it skips
out immediately when in fact we still
had two digits left we needed to
increment count again this is why the
condition should be temp is greater than
or equal to 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
