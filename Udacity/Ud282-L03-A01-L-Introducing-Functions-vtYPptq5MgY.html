we want to display we can see that it
starts out with a chorus once I had a
love and it was a gas soon found out had
a heart of glass seemed like the real
thing only to find mutual mistrust
love's gone behind and then these same
lines are repeated later on in the song
and to display these lyrics on our
karaoke machine we can write out a block
of code to print this chorus and other
lyrics and for our chorus we can copy
and paste the same code again wherever
the chorus appears but repeating the
same code again like this should be
avoided for example what if we wrote
chorus code with a small spelling error
we wrote live instead of love and we
found this error only after we'd copy
and pasted it when we did find this
small error we'd have to check all the
places our chorus code appears and go to
each place and change the blocks of code
individually this isn't too bad for two
copies of the same thing but it could
get out of hand very quickly and it can
be a lot of work for one small change
wouldn't it be useful to group our
chorus code together so that we can
reuse it and change it easily well we
can Java lets us group code together in
something called a function functions
hold all the instructions and
decision-making that's performed in a
specific task even something like
printing out a chorus in a song so we
can group these four lines of code
together in one function and any changes
we make in that function will affect
everywhere that is used automatically in
this lesson we'll learn all about
functions and how to create our own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
