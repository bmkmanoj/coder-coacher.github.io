controller is ready to go now let's add
the ability to manage a collection if we
look in the objective-c project we can
see that the saved gifts view controller
conforms to the uicollectionview
delegate the collection view data source
and the collective you delegate
flowlayout so we'll want to add all
three of those to the Swift file now
let's take a look at the implementation
if we scroll down to where the
datasource methods are we can see our
familiar friends number of items in
section and sulphur itemid index path
cool no surprises there let's switch
back to the Swift project add our
protocols and then implement those
methods I've got a mark here for the
delegate and data source methods and now
we want to add collectionview number of
items in section and sulphur itemid
index path for a number of items in
section we're just going to want to
return the number of saved gifts and
oops we're not really ready to implement
self right of an index path yet because
we haven't made our custom sell so let's
make our custom sell go ahead and add
the gift sell class and have it inherit
from collectionview sell open up
storyboard and find the scene called my
collection inside the collection view
you'll see the gift sell now go ahead
and drag an outlet from the gif image
view into the gift sell class and then
also in the gift sell class we're going
to need a function called configure for
gift and this is where we'll set the gif
image and now let's switch back to the
saved gifts view controller and of
course if we want to be able to see our
gift sell we should give it a size so
let's go here to our mark for the
collection view flowlayout and here we
are here's the method for size for item
at index path so the width of our cell
is going to be approximately half the
width of the collection view frame but
of course this method expects us to
return a size and we're going to need a
margin as well so let's go up to the top
of our class and create a constant to
hold the marg
you'll want to make this cell margin a
CG float so that it plays nicely with
the CG size and we incorporated into our
wits and then of course we'll want to
return the size and we should be good to
go so this ought to give us two columns
of cells in our collection view and
let's not forget to implement selfer
item at index path so of course will
when a DQ a cell will want to cast it to
a gift cell will grab a gift from the
saved gifts array and will configure the
cell for that gift now sometimes when I
just want to see my cells before I have
data to put in them I'll make them a
weird color so they stand out so I just
went into storyboard and I made them
this blue color and just for testing
purposes I'm returning five here in
number of items in section and then I
commented out these two lines in sulfur
item at index path and then when I run
the app what I see is this so i can see
my collection view and i can see my
cells and i can tell that they're spaced
the way I want them I can also see that
this view is kind of blocking my
collection if you look in the
objective-c project you'll notice that
this view that has the pink squares is
called the empty view because it's the
view that it's meant to appear when the
collection is empty my collection is an
empty right now so I'm going to go ahead
and add an outlet for this empty view
and I'll add a line to view will appear
so that when the number of saved gifts
does not equal zero the empty view is
hidden go ahead and add an outlet to
storyboard for the collection view and
then while we're here in view will
appear we can call reload data and now
you can move on to work on the preview
