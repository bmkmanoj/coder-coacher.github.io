broad range of semantic concepts via the
use of HTML attributes obviously aria is
a very complex topic and I can take a
long time to learn all of the precise
details of the best use of aria role
states and properties and special roles
and attributes like re alive the aria
practices document is a great place to
get information on well known aria best
practices and design patterns and the
Aria spec has all of the nitty-gritty
details and what each of the roles and
attributes does if you need to take a
deeper dive then like any skill it's a
matter of experimentation practice and
persistence there is no substitute for
trying things out with real-world
assistive technology especially screen
readers and keep an eye out because
browsers are also developing tooling
which will start to make all of this
easier however it bears repeating that
if you don't need to use Aria you can
just not implicit HTML semantics can get
you a very long way and will save you a
lot of effort in reimplemented the
semantics and behaviors of many standard
user experience patterns so that wraps
up our discussion of semantics it's been
a long journey but we're not quite done
with the cost yet while we definitely
need to make sure our semantics are in
order for assistive technology uses we
also need to make sure that the visual
UI is usable for everyone as well so in
the next lesson Robbie's going to
explain the role that styling can play
in accessibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
