we're gonna use the split operation to
do this so we could certainly build a
way to separate all the words in a web
page ourselves using the operation that
we've already seen we can use indexing
to go through the letters in the string
we can identify characters that we think
of as separating words such as a space
or a comma and we can collect those all
as separate strings the good news is
Python provides a built-in operation
that does exactly what we need
it's called split we invoke split on a
string and what it outputs is a list of
the words in the string for now we're
not going to worry too much about the
details of how split decides how to
separate a string into words but let's
look at a few examples to see that it
does something pretty close to what we
want for building our web index so we've
defined quote as the string which is
this quote from Robert Reich in
Washington it's dog-eat-dog in academia
it's exactly the opposite and now we'll
use split to divide the quote into its
words and you can see the result we have
a list where the elements of the list
are the words from the quote and split
does a pretty good job of dividing the
string into the words that we want for
our web index it's not perfect we can
see that Washington which was followed
by a comma in the quote ends up as the
string Washington including the comma
that's a different value than the
keyword Washington so if we search for
Washington and we built our index this
way we're not going to actually find
this occurrence so this isn't perfect
but it's going to be good enough for
what we use for now later on we can
think about ways to divide the webpage
into its component words in a way that
will be more accurate figure out exactly
how to decide when something's a new
word is a fairly tough problem though as
a second example to get a feel for how
split works let's try another quote here
we have a quote from David Letterman
there's no business like show business
but there's several businesses like
accounting I've introduced a new Python
contract we're using the triple quote
here the nice thing about triple quotes
is we can divide them over multiple
lines when we tried to enter the
previous quote using just the double
quotes it fell off the edge of the
screen using triple quotes we can define
one string spread over multiple lines
and now when we print out the result of
splitting the quote we see it's divided
into words it's fine that there are new
line
it's still separated in the words we
have we still have some issues like the
parenthesis is included as part of David
so this quote wouldn't show up for the
keyword David I'll leave it for you to
decide at the end of the class whether
computing is a business more like show
business or a business more like
accounting I'm going with show business
though so now let's see if you can write
the code to build an index using the
URLs collected from our web crawl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
