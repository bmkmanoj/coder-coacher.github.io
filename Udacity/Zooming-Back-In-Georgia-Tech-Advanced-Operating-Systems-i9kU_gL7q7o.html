within a given operating system we
already know that the process address
space for an application is an illusion
in the sense that the virtual memory
space of this process is contiguous but
in terms of physical memory they are not
contiguous and the page table data
structure that the operating system
maintains on behalf of the processes is
the one that supports this illusion so
far as this process is concerned by
mapping the virtual page number of the
process using the page table for this
particular process into the physical
page number where a particular virtual
page may be contained in physical memory
this is a setting in a non virtualized
operating system so the page table
serves as the broker to convert a
virtual page number to a physical page
number in a virtualized setting we have
another level of indirection that is
this physical page number of the
operating system has to be mapped to the
machine memory or the Machine page
numbers will call the pages in the
machine memory which is the real thing
as MPN short for machine page numbers
and this goes from 0 through some max
which is the total memory capacity that
you have in your hardware this data
structures a page table is the
traditional page table that gives a
mapping between virtual page number and
the physical page number and this is a
traditional page table the mapping
between the physical page number and the
Machine page number that is PPN to MPN
mapping is kept in another page table
which is called shadow page table SPT so
now in a virtualized setting there is a
two-step translation process to go from
VPN to MPN the page table maintained by
the guest operating system is the one
that translates VPN to PPN and then
there is this original page table
called the shadow page table that
converts the PPN to MPN that brings up
an interesting question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
