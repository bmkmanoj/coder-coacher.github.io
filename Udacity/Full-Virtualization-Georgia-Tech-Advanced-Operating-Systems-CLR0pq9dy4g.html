framework is what is called full
virtualization and in full
virtualization the idea is to leave the
operating system pretty much untouched
so you can run the unchanged binary of
the operating system on top of the
hypervisor this is called full
virtualization because the operating
system is completely untouched nothing
has been changed not even a single line
of code is modified in these operating
systems in order to run on the
hypervisor simultaneously but we have to
be a little bit clever to get this to
work however operating systems running
on top of the hypervisor are run as user
level processes they are not running at
the same level of privilege as a Linux
operating system that is running on bare
metal but if the operating system code
is unchanged it doesn't know that it
does not have the privilege for doing
certain things that it would do normally
on bare metal hardware in other words
when the operating system executes some
privileged instructions meaning they
have to be in a privileged mode or
kernel mode to run on bare metal in
order to execute those instructions
those instructions will create a trap
that goes into the hypervisor and the
hypervisor will then emulate the
intended functionality of the operating
system and this is what is called the
trap and emulate strategy essentially
each operating system thinks it is
running on bare metal and therefore it
does exactly what it would have done on
a bare metal processor meaning that it
will try to execute certain privileged
instructions thinking it has the right
privilege but it does not have the right
privilege because it's run as a user
level process on top of the hypervisor
and therefore when they try to do
something that requires a higher level
of privilege than the user level it will
result in a trap into the hypervisor
and the hypervisor will then emulate the
intended functionality of that
particular operating system there are
some thorny issues with this trap and
emulate strategy of full virtualization
and that is in some architectures some
privileged instructions may fail
silently what that means is you would
think that the instruction actually
succeeded but it did not and you may
never know about it and in order to get
it on this problem in fully virtualized
systems the hypervisor will resort to a
binary translation strategy meaning it
knows what are the things that might
fail silently in the architecture look
for those gotchas in each of these
individual binaries of the unmodified
guest operating systems and through
binary editing strategy they will ensure
that those instructions are dealt with
carefully so that if those instructions
fail silently the hypervisor can catch
it and take the appropriate action and
this was a problem in early instances of
Intel architecture both Intel and AMD
have since started adding virtualization
support to the hardware so that such
problems don't exist anymore but in the
early going when virtualization
technology was first experimented with
in the late 90s and the early 2000s this
was a problem that virtualization
technology had to overcome in order to
make sure that you can run operating
systems as unchanged binaries on a fully
virtualized hypervisor full
virtualization is the technology that is
employed in the VMware system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
