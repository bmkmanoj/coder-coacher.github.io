even though we've talked a lot about
what vocabulary is sometimes it's hard
to apply it to actual situations let's
start from the bottom and work up
negative 100,000 is part of a term but
the term that it's part of is actually
negative 100,000 x remember that the
term is the whole thing that's going to
be added to other things or subtracted
from other things so negative 100,000 on
its own is not a term so let's cross
that out we said earlier that negative
100,000 x is a variable term as a whole
but it's not the negative 100,000 that
makes the term a variable term it's the
X that does that so negative 100,000
itself is not a variable constant was
the word that we used for numbers that
were terms on their own things like
three million right here this is
something that is a term by itself that
has no variables as part of it negative
100,000 is not standing on its own it's
multiplied by X so this is not a
constant either that leaves us with
coefficient remember that coefficients
are the number parts of variable terms
so there are numbers that are x
variables to create variable terms I
know there are a lot of subtle
differences involved in this but over
time this will become much more natural
feeling great job working in all this
