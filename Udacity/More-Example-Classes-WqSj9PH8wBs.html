rectangles describing classes in a in a
system on the left is the rectangle
class it has two instance variables
describing points these might be for
example the upper left-hand corner the
lower right-hand corner the particular
instance variables attributes have names
p1 and p2 and they have types point
which presumably you've also declared in
your uml model in the Operations Section
there are three groups of operations
each group is separated by a stereotype
you can see the stereotypes because they
appear within the double angle brackets
for example at the top there's a
stereotype for constructor in the middle
there's one for query operations and the
bottom there's ones for update
operations within the those three groups
there's obviously going to be a
constructor operation there's query
operations for giving the area and the
aspect ratio of the rectangle and
they're going to return real numbers
real is a primitive type within UML and
at the bottom we have update operations
for moving and scaling the rectangle on
the right is the reservation class you
notice things are a little different
here we don't have any attributes we
begin initially with operations and then
we have two additional horizontal units
1-4 responsibilities and 14 exceptions
note specifically that the words
operations responsibilities and
exceptions here are not part of UML
they're just here to show you what the
boxes are being used for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
