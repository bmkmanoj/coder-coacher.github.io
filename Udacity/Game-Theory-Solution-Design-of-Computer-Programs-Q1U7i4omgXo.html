would hold and why is that well under
the identity function sort of the
arithmetic function three million is one
and a half times or its three times
better than 1 million and so half of
three million is one and a half times
better than 1 million so the gamble is
more but that's only true if 3 million
really is three times better than 1
million and for most people that's not
true that going from a hundred dollars
to a million dollars is a big big jump
and going from 1 million to 3 million is
a smaller jump than that even though
arithmetic aliy it's more in terms of
what you can do it seems like less and
that doesn't mean that people are
irrational in any way instead what it
means is that for people the value of
money is not a linear function rather
it's something more like a logarithmic
function meaning if you have a certain
amount of money if you double that money
you don't have get twice as much value
out of having that money rather you just
get one increment more of having that
money so let's try again so I'm going to
import the math module and now I'm going
to ask what's the best action starting
from $100 in my pocket but valuing money
with a logarithmic function rather than
with the identity or linear function and
now my best action tells me that what I
should be doing is holding and that
corresponds to my intuition that that's
the right thing and I can also ask well
what if I had 10 million dollars already
then what I take the bet assuming my
value of money is still logarithmic and
best action tells me that yes I should
if I have 10 million now I'm starting to
look at that money as more closely
linear again I'm at this stage where the
logarithmic function is approximately
linear locally if I've got 10 million I
could say yeah I'm risking 1 million but
that's no big deal I've already got 10
it's a good bet because if I win I get 3
or 0 that's one and a half on average
and that's more than one so I'm willing
to take that bet and I don't mind not
gaining the additional 1 million</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
