this is a tiny bit different than the
one we saw earlier earlier we saw this
exercise without the squares and options
we were forced to pick the triangle but
here since we actually have the square
as the option I think the easier
transformation is to say that the middle
shape is disappearing and thus the
triangle disappears and leaves us with
just that square so I'd say that five is
the correct answer that's a good answer
David but note that three could also be
an answer because one could imagine the
relationship between a and B little
differently suppose we were to say the
outer circle is disappearing and the
inner circle is expanding in that case
will again get me so in that case we
might say that outer image is
disappearing this Square and the inner
shape is expanding to give us three so
three is also a legitimate answer so I
imagine though that most people would
choose answer five over answer three but
why would most of us choose answer five
over answer three that's a great
question
let's look at this in more detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
