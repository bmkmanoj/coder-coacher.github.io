to mention very briefly is something
called lda which is short for linear
discriminant analysis so any guess on
what linear discriminant alice's might
do Michael it may well linear so it's
got a linear in it discriminant reminds
me of like classification lines yes so
what linear discriminant analysis does
is it finds a projection that
discriminates based on the label this
actually will feel this feels a lot like
supervised learning right you take
advantage of the label and you come up
with the transformation such that you
will in fact project things into
different clumps or clusters or
otherwise separate them based upon their
label so you can imagine using a lot of
algorithms as we use in the past in some
sense what they're doing is linear
discriminant analysis they're finding
lines or finding linear separators
between different clumps of points and
if you think about the binary case for
example you could think of svm as doing
something like this where what you've
done is you transform your points not
into a specific label plus or minus one
or zero yes or no but you instead
project it onto the line such that it
will clump things accordingly and you
use the value of that projection as a
way of re representing the data does
that make sense yeah and this this
approach seems a little different from
all the other ones in that it's actually
paying attention to how the resulting
components are going to get used right
that's exactly is going to try to help
you specifically with the with the
classification that's exactly right all
three of the examples we gave before
feel almost like filter methods right
and that they have some criteria and
they're trying to maximize even though
randomized projections is power who
knows what it's trying to maximize
besides randomness but they don't care
about the ultimate learner or the
ultimate label that's associated with
them whereas lda does care explicitly
about the labels and wants to find ways
to discriminate finds sort of
projections or features that make it
easier for you to do that discrimination
now it also does not care about what
learner is going to happen next but it
does care about the label so it does end
up doing something slightly different
and works pretty well in a world where
you have very
simple things that can be linearly
discriminated okay yeah so that's it for
the alternatives i actually think that's
pretty much it for feature
transformation so when we wrap up just a
question though so lda I've heard of lda
in this context before meaning something
else like latent dear slay a location
yeah but that happened long after linear
discriminant analysis and we haven't
moved past the 90s well I'm just saying
that it does seem I think it is actually
an unsupervised approach Leighton
diciotto absolutely but as well beyond
the scope of the discussion that we're
going to have here alright as you wish
but it is in fact every time you see a d
you can think dear slay which is the
computer science pronunciation other
people pronounce it differently yes
because the correct way of pronouncing
it is sort of Yama is another syllable
in there is it German or something is
dis really the dilly dilly that sounded
German ok so let's wrap up Michael all
right okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
