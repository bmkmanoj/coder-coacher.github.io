it's going to take 3.4 seconds to bring
the car to a complete stop and with a
smaller amount of friction it's 4.9
seconds and now let's look at how to
compute this we have to take two
different forces into account the force
due to friction breaking that is and the
force due to gravity Newton says force
equals mass times acceleration the force
due to friction equals the mass of the
car times the deceleration as we are
breaking of the car but the force
exerted due to friction is a multiple of
the force exerted by gravity with a
proportionality constant mu and what's
the force exerted by gravity it's the
mass of the car times the gravitational
acceleration of the earth you see thats
Newton's law applied in the reverse
direction if you look closely you see
that mass cancels from both sides of the
equation and the deceleration equals the
constant of friction times the
gravitational acceleration this is one
funny consequence for astronauts when
you try to break a car on the moon the
gravitational acceleration is far less
than on earth and so the deceleration is
far less than on earth braking is far
more ineffective on the moon than on
earth now we can use this result to look
at how speed depends on time the
deceleration is constant so the velocity
decreases by a certain fixed amount of
meters per second per second the
relationship between velocity and time
is linear and the slope of this line is
given by the acceleration of this side
has a length of one this side has a
length of a the acceleration which is as
we now know the constant of friction
times the gravitational acceleration you
see two similar triangles in here so we
have the time it takes to come to a
complete stop divided by the initial
velocity equals 1 divided by the
deceleration so that the time it takes
to come to a complete stop equals 120
km/h / our deceleration which is the
constant of friction times the
gravitational acceleration we
have to go from km/h 2 meters per second
the cavitation acceleration equals 9.81
meters per second squared to make this
work we should be using m/s for the
velocity as well one kilometer is 1,000
meters and one hour amounts to and one
hour amounts to 3600 seconds now you can
do the math</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
