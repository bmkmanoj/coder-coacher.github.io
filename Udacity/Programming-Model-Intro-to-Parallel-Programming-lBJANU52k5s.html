diagram we've got threads and we've got
thread blocks and really what is
happening with these barriers is that
the sync threads call is creating a
barrier within a thread block so all the
threads within this thread block are
going to get to this sync threads call
stop and wait until they've all arrived
and then proceed and these thread blocks
are organized in kernels every kernel
has a bunch of thread blocks we haven't
talked about this really but there's an
implicit barrier between kernels so if I
launch two kernels one after another
then by default kernel a will finish
before kernel B is allowed to start so
all of these threads will complete
before any of these threads get launched
so when you add in our memory model that
we've talked about where every thread
has access to its own local memory to
its block shared memory and to the
global memory shared by all threads and
all kernels in the system then what
you've got is CUDA at its heart CUDA is
a hierarchy of computation that would be
the thread thread blocks and kernels
with a corresponding hierarchy of memory
spaces local shared and global and
synchronization primitives sync threads
barriers and the implicit barrier in
between two synchronous kernels</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
