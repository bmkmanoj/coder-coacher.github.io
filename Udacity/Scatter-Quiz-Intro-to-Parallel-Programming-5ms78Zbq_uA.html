three neighboring elements average their
value and write a single output result
we can have each thread read a single
input result and add one third of its
elements value to the three neighboring
elements so each of these writes would
really be a an increment operation you
can imagine the same thing on our 2d
image blurring example where each thread
takes one input element or pixel and
writes a fraction of its value to the
neighboring pixels so in each parallel
task needs to write its result in a
different place or in multiple places we
call the scatter because the threads are
scattering the results over memory you
can see already a problem that we're
going to have with scatter you've got
several threads attempting to write to
the same place at more or less the same
time this is something we'll have to
talk about later let's have a quick quiz
on this suppose you have a list of
basketball players you've got a bunch of
records and each one has the name of the
player and the height of the player and
the rank in the height okay so in the in
the league or in it on the team whether
this is the first tallest the second
tallest the third tallest the last
tallest or so on okay so you've got
their rank and height and say that your
goal now is to write each player's
record into its location in a sorted
list so if we implement this in CUDA by
having each thread read a record and
look at the rank and use that rank to
determine where to write into the array
is this a map operation or a gather
operation or a scatter operation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
