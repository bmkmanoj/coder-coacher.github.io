pattern a checkerboard consisting of
just four texels what happens if you put
this texture on a square there are now
many pixels all sampling the same Texel
the obvious answer is that you want this
texture to continue to look like a
checkerboard with a sharp edge between
the squares in other words you want
something like this nice and crisp
however if you viewed this texture from
a different angle it doesn't look so
great this is a zoomed in view just to
drive home the plane you get the
stair-stepping effect instead of nice
smooth edges this is called the jaggies
the problem is that the texture will
return either black or white at every
pixel you'd like 50 shades of gray or so
but there's only these two levels
sampling the texture in this way is
called nearest-neighbor whatever textile
center is closest to the pixel center is
the color of the pixel gets the other
option is bilinear interpolation or
linear for short what this mode does is
takes the four closest Texel centers and
interpolates among them the closer the
pixel is to the textile center the more
of that color you get if you turn on
bilinear interpolation this is what you
get that's definitely too much of a good
thing you'd like blurring along the
edges of the squares but not across the
whole texture the problem here is that
one texel covers a huge number of pixels
let's say we aim to change this ratio to
be about one texel per pixel in other
words say our original 2x2 checker
pattern covers 100 by 100 pixels to
bring the ratio of texels to pixels to
be closer let's make the 2x2 checker
pattern be represented by an image
texture of 64 by 64 texels so that each
checker square itself covers 32 by 32
texels in other words we'll just make
the same pattern but with a larger
texture each Texel in this larger
texture will now cover around one pixel
this turns out to look pretty good
the stair steps are gone you'll try the
demo in a minute and see for yourself
in three.js setting the filtering to be
nearest or linear is straightforward
there's not a lot to it using bilinear
interpolation causes more taps to occur
that is more texture samples to be
retrieved but it's usually what you want
generally you should use linear which is
the default at the same time you want to
avoid situations where a Texel covers a
lot of pixels here's our original 2x2
texture
when we have a situation where a textile
covers more than a pixel this is called
magnification when magnification is
occurring the textures mag filter is
used another way to say it is that if
the number of texels divided by the
number of pixels is less than 1
magnification is happening you're
magnifying the texture say we zoom out
on our 2x2 texture and it all falls
within one pixel if a textile covers
less than one pixel that is one pixel
contains more than one texel this
situation is called minification in this
situation the mag filter is not used
we'll deal with minification and how to
set the corresponding min filter in the
next lesson at this point I want you to
study a demo as I'll be asking you about
it try out various resolution textures
and see how they work with
nearest-neighbor and linear filtering
try the higher resolution texture
patterns and try tilting the view to see
what happens then play with the zoom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
