the missing values for you and let's try
to check a few for example let's take
the elements related to x1 we move from
X 0 to X 1 which added one of the main
diagonal we move from X 1 to X 2 which
add another one so we have two but we
also had one observation next one being
commended by 2 because of the
measurement strength 0.5 1 over that is
2 so when the end of the measurement we
end up with 4 let's pick this off
diagonal element over here this was only
affected if any moving from X 1 to X 2
and it was a minus 1 this element over
here was affected when we sensed LM 1
from X 1 and again the off diagonal
element is negative so we added a minus
2 over here it's quite involved as you
can see let's take a number on the right
side the minus 2 over here this is
adding up every contribution to X 2 the
first one occurred when we moved into X
2 from X 1 at which point we added 2
when X 2 we also measure at Len my l1
with the measurement value of 2 we have
to multiply it up by 2 to arrive at 4
and subtract it so we invited minus 4 we
get the minus 2 if you work out all
these examples using the math the
explaining class and working in the fact
that measurements get a default factor
of 2 for every value you add you arrive
at exactly this matrix over here I hope
you got a good number of numbers right
there was not an easy task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
