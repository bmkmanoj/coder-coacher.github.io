uprising we're ready to get to the main
goal of this class as far as building
the search engine our goal is to improve
the results by finding the best webpage
instead of just returning a list of all
the web pages that match a query as the
web has grown is become more and more
important for search engines to do this
ranking well that what really
distinguished Google from previous
search engines was they had a much
smarter way of ranking pages that
produce more useful results where the
first one or two results in response to
search query were often the very thing
that the user was searching for so now
we're ready to start thinking about the
problem of how to rank web pages let's
start by recapping how our search engine
works so we started by building a
crawler and what the crawler did and
this was what we did in units 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
what the crawler did was follow all the
links in the web pages following those
links building up in index and the end
result of the crawler after units 4 &amp;amp; 5
was we had an index by the end of unit 5
it was a hash table where we could look
up a keyword and we would find the entry
where that keyword might appear and we
would follow that and we could look
through each of those entries to find
the one that matched and that would
match the keyword that we were looking
for and as its value it would have a
list of all the URLs where that keyword
appears and the order of those URLs in
that list was determined just by how we
added them to the crawl every time we
encountered a new page we indexed that
page and we added a URL for that keyword
so the one that's first in this list is
just the one that we happen to find
first so say it's the see page the one
that second would be the one that we
find next and it's this page so this
doesn't tell us anything about which
page is best so the order of the URLs in
the list and what we were getting is
your output just depends on the order
that things happen to go in the crawl
when the web was really small which was
quite a while ago now this was sort of
okay that there were only a few pages
that might match a given keyword and you
could look through them all and decide
which one
wanted with the Web today this doesn't
work at all there are thousands of pages
that match any interesting keyword maybe
millions certainly many more than you
want to look through by hand so the most
important thing that a good search
engine does is figure out how to rank
these pages so the one that the user
gets is to figure out how to rank these
pages so the one that's at the front of
the list is the one the user wants so
that's our goal
for the rest of this unit to figure out
how to rank pages before we do this for
web pages we're gonna do something very
similar but perhaps easier right - we're
going to talk about how we decide who's
popular</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
