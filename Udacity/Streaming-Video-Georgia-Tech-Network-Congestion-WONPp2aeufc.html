server streams stored audio and video
the server stores the audio or video
files the client requests the files and
plays them as they download and it's
important to play the data at the right
time and the server can divide the data
into segments and then label each
segment with the timestamp indicating
the time at which that particular
segment should be played so the client
knows when to play that data the data
must arrive at the client quickly enough
otherwise the client can't keep playing
the solution is to have a client use
what's called a playout buffer where the
client stores data as it arrives from
the server and plays the data for the
user in a continuous fashion
thus data might arrive more slowly or
more quickly from the server but as long
as the client is playing data out of the
buffer at a continuous rate the user
sees a smooth play out a client may
typically wait a few seconds before it
starts playing a stream to allow data to
be built up in this buffer to account
for cases when the server might have
times where it is not sending at a rate
that's sufficient to satisfy the
client's playout rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
