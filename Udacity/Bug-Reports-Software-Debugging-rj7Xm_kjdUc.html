software also means you have to provide
lots of support which meant that I got
plenty of bug reports these ranged from
the absurd as in diddly crashed thought
you'd like to know today rather
questionable ddd crashed on a cray i
haven't closed the core damp please be
aware we're working on super secret data
here so don't share attachment core dump
50 megabytes some of them were very
questionable ddd hangs on my new pets at
home project all files are enclosed
attached home directory the home
directory here actually included
passwords and bank account information
so much for free software on some days i
could easily get dozens and dozens of
such bug reports some with helpful
information many without of course i
would have been able to ask for more
information on each of these but then
you know I wasn't exactly paid for the
job finally I would set up ddd such that
whenever it crashed it would ask for
vital information that I needed to
reproduce the failure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
