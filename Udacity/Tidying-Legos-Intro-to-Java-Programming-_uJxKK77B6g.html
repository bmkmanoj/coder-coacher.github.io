a computation such as the total cost
equals purchase price plus cost of gas
you might want to have a decision if the
total cost one is less than the total
cost to two one thing else too another
thing you might want to repeat certain
steps while the bank balance is less
than your target or repeat some action
say 10 times those are the three
essential elements of pseudocode
computations or other actions without
any regard of the syntax of a particular
programming language when you learn
programming there are two things that
you need to learn that syntax of the
programming language and how to solve
problems and we'll do this in parallel
on true traps in the next lesson you'll
learn quite a bit more about how to work
with the programming language but right
now let's learn a little bit more about
algorithms pseudocode and problem
solving you've just seen an algorithm
that manipulated numbers to give you a
useful answer but I thought it would be
more fun to show you a few examples that
don't have to do with numbers so here is
Robbie our home robot a robot is a
computer - it carries out tasks and one
has to program it to do the right thing
right now
Robbie's task is to clean up a bunch of
Legos Robbie needs to put all the blue
Legos before all the yellow Legos here's
our first attempt at an algorithm it's a
sequence of steps Robbie will wave his
magic wand and he will say make it so
well that's not really going to work an
algorithm has to be executable and not
involve magic steps our pseudocode here
asks Robbie to repeatedly execute these
statements namely while the blocks are
not yet in order each time Robbie is
supposed to scan the sequence of blocks
find the first one that's yellow before
a blue one and swap them so Robbie would
go along starting at the left until it
finds the yellow one before a blue one
swap the two and then it would do it
again in the next step I would scan from
the left until it finds the yellow one
before a blue one and swap them and
again now I'd like you to try this
writer B for blue and Y for yellow tell
me the sequence of the blocks after the
next swap and the next one after that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
