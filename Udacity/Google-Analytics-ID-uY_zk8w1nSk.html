account ID I'll walk you through this
process and in the next node you'll do
it yourself we start by going to
analytics google com if you're already
logged into Google you'll see the access
google analytics button at the top right
if you're not already logged in you'll
see a button for signing in I'm going to
assume you already have a Google account
but if not go ahead and create one now
so now I'm going to sign in if you're
new to analytics you'll see a welcome
screen go ahead and sign up for
analytics you're going to be tracking a
mobile app and you need to enter an
account name this can be whatever you
like it's for you to identify the count
it's a good practice to have the name be
something that relates to your app then
you need to set up the app name
analytics doesn't check that it
corresponds to a real app name so again
enter something helpful to you go ahead
and fill in the rest of the form choose
an industry category our sample app is
to do with dinner guess that would be
food and drink my reporting timezone is
the United States gmt pacific time yours
might be different and then also choose
the data sharing settings the first data
sharing option is that you can choose to
share your data with other Google
products only and this means sharing the
data with your other accounts for
example this lets you import your
analytics data into AdWords account if
you have one the next data sharing
setting is that you can choose to share
your data anonymously with Google and
others this basically just means that
your data will be shared completely
anonymize with Google all identifying
information removed from it and Google
will use the data for marketing
educational purposes and to create
customized communications if you share
your data with technical support this
helps us help you if you have technical
difficulties the last sharing option is
for account specialist so if you share
your data with it count specialists this
means that the google account specialist
can look at your data and help you
optimize your strategies and you see
at the bottom it tells you how many
accounts you're using for this user that
I've logged in with I'm using zero out
of a hundred account so this is going to
be my first account so now i'm going to
get my tracking ID accept the Terms of
Service assuming you do accept them and
look yay I have a tracking ID so this
tracking ID is going to be the link
between your app and analytics you'll
add the account ID to your mobile app
code and then when people use your app
the app will send usage data to
analytics at this ID</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
