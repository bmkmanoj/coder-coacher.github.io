Python interpreter we'll give it the
name measure Udacity and we'll give the
parameter to the name P actually we
should probably give the parameter the
name you and will use an uppercase u not
the most standard name for parameter but
appropriate in this case we'll introduce
a variable count
we'll set its initial value to zero
we're gonna use count to keep track of
the number of strings that we found that
satisfy the Udacity property and we'll
use a for loop to go through all of the
elements in you so now we need to decide
whether or not to count this element we
can use an if statement to do this we're
going to need to use a comparison to
check if the first character of the
string is an uppercase u if it is we
want to add 1 to the value of count if
it's not we do nothing so we use the
Equality test to check if the value at
position 0 any the current element of
the list is an uppercase u if it is we
add one to count if not we don't need to
do anything so we don't need an else
clause and now we just need to return
the value of count so let's test our
procedure so our first example the input
strings were dave Sebastian and Katie we
see the result is zero as expected
we'll try the second example where we
have two strings that start with the
letter U and see that we get the result
two as the second value printed out we
should also test the string that has a
mix of use and non use so now we're
passing in four strings they all start
with a u but only two of them start with
an uppercase u so the result for the
third number printed out should also be
a two and we see that we get the
expected result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
