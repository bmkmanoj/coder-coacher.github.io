value of our into the equation now we
need to work toward isolating T so i'm
going to divide both sides of the
equation by this coefficient on here 10
to the negative 12 that leaves us with
0.79 5 equals e to the negative T over
8,200 23 now what we need to do is get T
out of the exponent so what do we need
to do well we need to take a log since
he is the base of our exponent here our
logs to have the same base that means
you need to take the natural log of both
sides on the left side that's just going
to give us some number that we can
calculate with the calculator but
overhear something a little bit more
interesting is happening we have to
inverse operations that are going to
cancel one another out leaving us with
just the exponent as the entire quantity
on this side I'll leave the left side as
is for now so we have natural log of 0
point 795 is equal to negative T over 82
23 now it's easy all we need is a little
bit of multiplication we need to
multiply both sides by negative 8220 3
so that leaves us with T equals negative
8220 three times the natural log of 0.7
95 let's pull out our calculator to
figure out what number this is equal to
using a calculator and rounding gives us
a value of T of about 1886 so this piece
of parchment from the dead sea scrolls
is about 1886 years old now in a real
situation estimates are a bit better
than this they're calibrated using for
example tree rings to determine a
slightly more accurate amount of
carbon-14 in the plant material at a
given time still it's pretty awesome
that we can even come up with any sort
of estimate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
