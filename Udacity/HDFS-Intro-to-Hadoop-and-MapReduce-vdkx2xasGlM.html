Hadoop distributed file system which
everyone just refers to as HDFS as a
developer this looks very much like a
regular file system the kind you're used
to working with on a standard machine
but it's helpful to understand what's
going on behind the scenes so that's
what we're going to talk about here
imagine we're going to store a file
called my data txt in HDFS this file is
150 megabytes when a file is loaded into
HDFS it's split into chunks which we
call blocks each block is pretty big
the default is 64 megabytes each block
is given a unique name which is blk an
underscore and a large number we'll call
ours block one two and three and in our
case the first block is 64 megabytes the
second block is 64 megabytes the third
block is the remaining 22 megabytes to
make up our 150 megabyte file as the
file is uploaded HDFS each block will
get stored on one node in the cluster
there's a daemon or piece of software
running on each of the machines in the
cluster called the data node now clearly
we need to know which blocks make up the
original file and that's handle by a
separate machine running a daemon called
the name node the information stored on
the name node is known as the metadata
that's fine as far as it goes but there
are some problems with this take a look
at the diagram and see if you can spot
when we might run into trouble for
example let's say there was a network
failure between the nodes or a disk
failure on a data node do you think it's
an issue that not all of the data nodes
are used to store data or could it be a
problem that the block sizes differ two
of them are 64 megabytes but one was
only 22 megabytes finally do you think
it'd be a problem if we had a disk
failure on the name node</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
