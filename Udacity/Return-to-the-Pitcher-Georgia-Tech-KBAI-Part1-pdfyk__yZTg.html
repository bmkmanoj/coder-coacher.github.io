baseball pitcher who has to decide on a
action to take in a particular
circumstance so we can think of this
picture as mapping a percept history
into an action now imagine that this
picture is embodying a production system
we are back to a very specific situation
and you can certainly read it again
recall that David had given the answer
the picture will intentionally walk the
batter so we want to normal the theory
of how might the pitcher or in journal
and AI agent come to this decision
recall the very specific situation that
the pitcher is facing and recall also
the david had come up with this answer
so here is a set of percept and hit is
an action and the question is how do
these percepts get mapped into this
action we are going to at once Bullet
theory of how the human picture might be
making these decisions as well as a
theory of how it hey I agent could be
built to make these decisions so let us
go back to an example of the picture
having to decide on an action in a
particular situation in the world so the
picture has several kinds of knowledge
some of its knowledge is internal it
already has it some of it it can
perceive from the world around it as an
example the picture can perceive the
various objects here such as the bases
first second third base the pitcher can
perceive the batter here the pitcher can
perceive the current state of the game
the specific score in the inning the
specific batter the pitcher can perceive
the positions of its own teammates so
all these things the pitcher can
perceive and these then are become exact
specific kinds of knowledge that he
pitcher has the picture also has
internal knowledge the picture has
knowledge about his goals and objectives
