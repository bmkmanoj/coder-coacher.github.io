in this class are well a little bit
contrived but this one is actually
practical so let's say your spaceship
crashes onto a strange planet could
happen to you you'll want to know what
to do at first you're not too happy
because you don't know where you are but
then you see the strange tree over here
with a vine dangling from one of the
branches and this makes you happy
because now you think hey I can make a
pendulum out of this and perhaps by
doing that I can somehow figure out what
the acceleration due to gravity is on
this strange planet so to make this into
a pendulum you tie your space backpack
filled with space weights down at the
bottom of this of this fine which by the
way has a length of 12 meters so your
goal is to find little G the
acceleration due to gravity on the
surface of this strange planet so what
you do is you pull this back by a small
amount and let it swing back and forth
and back and forth and you time this
swinging and when you let it swing back
and forth 10 times you find it takes 45
seconds so I want you to tell me what is
little G the acceleration due to gravity
and you can enter your answer here in
seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
