want you to put everything together and
build a particle filter and I'm
supplying you with code that has as gaps
pretty much the to function you just
program to move and sense in some
additional code that I copied from class
the particle filter code that you're
familiar with and also some code that
helps you test your routines so you can
make sure they're correct the key new
thing you have to do is you have to walk
in the noise there is no barring noise
and steering noise and distance noise
the code the Devo didn't have any of
those I want you now to modify your
procedures to accommodate this nose
steering noise this is Lois and Barry
noise and all of it should be Gaussian
so let's go all the way to the end
there's two test cases the first test
case which are uncommitted so we can run
it and what this is it weights the
sequence of robot motions each of these
time steps are what turns a little bit
and moves forward and also has eight
measurements which are the bearings to
those four different landmarks if I go
up a little bit in the code then you'll
find that the ground truth final
position was 93 75 and five point two
when I run it it runs the routine
particle filter with those motions and
those measurements as an input and it
produces an estimate which is ninety
four seventy one and five point two
which isn't exactly the same as up here
but it's close so this is a particle
filter working I am supplying quite a
few functions for you when you should
look around one it's called particle
fighters that's exactly the same code we
used in class and constructed together I
just copied it over so if we look at
this you'll find hopefully no surprise
here and I'm also supplying you the
measurement probability function which
is part of the implementations let's
just go there so here's the measurement
probability function there's something
non-trivial here I compute the predicted
measurements and then I compute a
Gaussian that measures the distance
between the measurements passed into the
routine and the predicted measurements
computed over here that's all happening
down here here's my Gaussian function
with the exponential and then I return
my Gaussian error there should be no
surprise here what's important is a
little modification with the sense
function that you have
seen before I can now give the sense
function of parameter you never even
parameter zero it switches off the noise
model so you will need the noise model
for forward simulation of the robot but
you don't need it for compute the
probability of a measurement so augment
your sense function I have a flag that
if it's set to zero switches on off the
noise model and gets you the predicted
best possible measurements so what you
have to do is you have to find the part
of the code that says only add modified
color code below here you have to copy
over your move function and then work in
as it says in the instructions
the steering noise and the distance
noise that is Gaussian noise I hope you
know I do this then you also have to
plug in the sense function and you also
have to plug in a bearing noise and make
sure there's a flag that allows you to
switch off the bearing noise and it
should be an optional flag so the
history of a default value of the
bearing noise being on otherwise your
code won't run so here's how we will
test your code if you go to test case
number two then I wrote a few excel
functions for you that allow you to test
your particle failures on many many
instances just like the ones we will be
using for testing that are all randomly
generated let me just go through that
code line by line our test case will be
eight steps long there's the same
motions vector we had before of a slight
turn on a circle generate ground truth
gives us a sequence of measurements and
a robot position that we can split as
follows using a robot simulation then
you run your particle filter over here
and the function check output down here
compares the final robot position the
ground truth position with your particle
filter position estimated position from
here and gives us a single flag whether
this is all correct so let me just do
this we generate a robot that finished
at final location twenty - twenty nine
and this orientation over here the
particle filter came up with 22 - 31 in
0.14 which is close to the originals and
my code checks said true let me run it
again different values still true
when it again different values still
true now it couldn't happen that the
coat-check says false
I just offended 20 times it's a tool for
me every single time but I've seen it's
a false and the reason is it's a it's a
randomized algorithm it's a particle
filter it might actually do not have a
particle at the right place so when we
test your routine we're gonna call your
own code check check output we have our
own function for this but we're gonna
run it multiple times and if you get it
wrong once that's not a big deal
so in summary you will have to comment
out all the test cases again all you
have to do is supply the missing
function you can test the correctness
yourself you can basically grade
yourself with this test case over here
but when you submitted have those
commented out because we have our test
software and all you're gonna test is
whether your particle filter gives us a
good estimate when we choose randomly be
initial position of the robot
measurements motions and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
