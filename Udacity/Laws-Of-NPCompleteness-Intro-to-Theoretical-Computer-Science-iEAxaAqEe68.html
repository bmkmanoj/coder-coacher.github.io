problem other than avoiding it well I
think you should think of yourself as
kind of a lawyer who has to work with
the laws of np-completeness and the main
law of np-completeness is this unless P
equals NP there will be no polynomial
time algorithm for your NP complete
problems now what do good lawyers do
with the law they find loopholes and
that is exactly what we are going to do
for this law of NP completeness and will
actually be looking at two loopholes the
loophole that we'll be exploring in this
unit is using intelligent exponential
time algorithms so we're going to work
in exponential time but we're going to
do it in a smart way so we're going to
avoid things like 2 to the power of n or
3 to the power of n but rather we're
going to have algorithms that for
example have something like 1.3 to the
power of n which is already much better
and works for many practical cases what
we are then going to look at in the next
units is what i like to call sloppy
solutions for all our proofs of
np-completeness we always required the
computer to provide the exact answer to
our problem so one chance to circumvent
NP completeness might be to say well we
do not want the best possible solution
but we're happy with say one that is
close to optimal or for a decision
problem for example we might be saying
well it's ok if we get the right answer
in about eighty percent of the time for
each of these approaches we will discuss
the main ideas and also of course give
you some examples to make them more
clear and talk a bit about the theory
behind these approaches because these
are techniques but you really have to
understand the theory if you want to be
successful in practice so let's start
out with smart exponential time
algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
