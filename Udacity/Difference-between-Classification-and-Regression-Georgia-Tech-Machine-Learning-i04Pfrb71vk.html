going it's going pretty well how's it
going your end of the world very nice so
what do we want to talk about today well
today we are going to talk about
supervised learning but in particular
what we're going to talk about are two
kinds of supervised learning and one
particular way to do supervised learning
okay so the two types of supervised
learning that we typically think about
our classification and regression and
we're going to spend most of the time
today talking about classification and
more time next time talking about
regression so the difference between
classification and regression is fairly
simple for the purposes of this
discussion classification is simply the
process of taking some kind of input
let's call it X and I'm going to define
these terms in a couple of minutes and
mapping it to some discreet label
usually for what we're talking about
something like true or false so what's a
good example of that imagine that I have
a nice little picture of Michael it
looks just like me
it looks exactly like you so I have a
nice little picture here and I want to
know whether this is a male or a female
so give it an input like this I will map
it to male or female so what do you
think Michael do you think this is a
male or if you're classifying me as male
or female based on the picture of me and
I would think you know based on how I
look I'm clearly male yes in fact manly
male so this would be a classification
from pictures to male the alternative
would be something like a picture to
female and I'm just going to take a
completely stereotypical image of either
a female or I think it's actually that's
actually me when I let my hair go log
right so so which points out that this
can be pretty hard but this is what
we're going to spend most of our time
talking about it first is the
classification test so taking some kind
of input in this case pictures and
mapping it to some discrete number of
labels true or false male or female car
versus cougar anything that you might
imagine thinking on a car versus cougar
yes that I guess that's an important
thing if you're driving you don't want
to run into any Cougars or probably
other cars either well you know you're
sitting down and you're trying to decide
whether you should ride this thing that
you
or not and if it's a cougar maybe you
don't want to and if it's a car maybe
you do excellent don't drive a cougar
don't drive a cougar that's the first
lesson in machining okay so that's
classification will return to regression
and it's in a little bit later during
this conversation but just as a preview
regression is more about continuous
valued functions so something like given
a bunch of points I want to give it a
new point I want to map it to some real
value so we may pretend that these are
examples of a line and so given a point
here I might say the output is right
there so that's regression we'll talk
about that in a moment right now what I
want to talk about is classification
what an example of regression also be
for example mapping the pictures of me
to the length of my hair like a number
that represents the length of my hair
absolutely for the purposes of the sort
of things that we're going to be worried
about you can really think of the
difference between classification and
regression is the difference between
mapping from some input to some small
number of discrete values which might
represent concepts and regression is
mapping from some input space to some
real number potentially an infinite
number of real numbers cool so let's
let's do it let's do a quiz to make sure
we get this I like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
