have noticed that not only can you zoom
down to street level but you can also
see what the location looks like as if
you were standing there looking around
this is called Street View
it's an incredible immersive technology
that allows you to explore the world
without leaving your desk and if you
think that's an exaggeration or over
marketing here's an example of Street
View that actually happened to me as
well as working for Google I've authored
a number of very popular young adult
science fiction novels two of the
locations that I've used in these novels
are the town of Shiprock in the Navajo
Reservation in New Mexico and the town
of Cayetana just outside Nagasaki in
Japan I've never been to either place
but I've gotten fan mail from people who
live in them asking me to say hi the
next time I'm in town I did all of my
location research using Google Maps and
in particular Google Street View the
great news as an Android developer is
that all of this imagery is available to
you using Google's API s let's take a
look at a simple Street View application
that allows you to hike the Grand Canyon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
