research that was one of the ways that
we got unstuck when we were in local
optima when we were doing optimization
maybe this will also come in handy in
this setting yeah I like the idea
because I came up with it but I can see
a couple you know but I can see a couple
of problems with it well wait you can't
see a problem with it yet because it's
not even clear what you meant or maybe
that's the first problem well it was
clear what I meant in my head now you're
gonna want my mouth to understand what
my head meant well then you're just
asking for too much so I really kind of
meant random restarts where you just
kind of started over over and over and
over again the problem with that is it's
already going to take a long time you
know infinity to get to a good answer
and we thought we might have this issue
with randomized optimization certainly
this is going to be a problem here but
it still feels like there's something we
could do with the randomness idea that
would help us to overcome this problem
with using what we know and only using
what we know all right all right so I
like that direction
so let's think a little bit about what
that could mean so random research was
one idea that we had when we were
talking in optimization about getting
unstuck which is let yourself get stuck
and then once you realize you're stuck
throw everything out and start over
again right you're right that's gonna
end up being really slow but we had a
different way of using randomness to get
unstuck in for example algorithms like
simulated annealing that's what I was
thinking about yeah so simulated
annealing the idea is simulated
annealing is that you tended you take
uphill steps but occasionally you're
willing to take a random downhill step
right so it's kind of this mixture of
choosing randomly and using what you
know what seems to be the best right and
so yeah yeah I can see that so then the
random restarts thing kind of works if
you instead of it being a random restart
it's a it's just a random action every
once in a while yeah excellent
all right so simulated annealing like
approach says that we're gonna take a
random action you know sometimes so then
our exploration policy are approximate
policy is going to be to when we're in
state s figure out the best action in
that state according to our estimate and
take that with probability I don't know
let's say
one minus Epsilon mm-hmm and otherwise
take a random action and see what
happens I have a probability Epsilon
yeah that's what's that's what's left
over so right so that's why you had one
minus Epsilon because you want to
epsilon to be small so epsilon is gonna
be so every once in a while you will
randomly act oh and then that'll that'll
that'll solve the simulated nailing
problem or do what some and they only
helps you with my just taking a random
action in what looks like a bad
direction
comparatively some times but it also
means that you get to explore the whole
space and so you have a chance of
actually learning the true Q exactly so
and but and yet most of the time we're
you know we're spending assuming epsilon
is small we're spending a lot of our
time taking good actions or actions that
we think are good but we're always
holding out some probability of taking
other actions to help us improve our Q
hat so if you do that infinitely long
and you this will also this will let you
visit sa an infinite number of times as
long as epsilon is greater than zero
that's right and that the MVP is
connected right so there could be state
action pairs that just can't ever be
reached in which case you won't reach
them but that's okay because since you
can't reach them they really don't
matter and they sort of don't exist
exactly all right so let's um let's
focus in on this a little bit more
because I think this is now the first
idea that we've had for choosing actions
that has the property that it will learn
and it will use what it learns hmm I
like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
