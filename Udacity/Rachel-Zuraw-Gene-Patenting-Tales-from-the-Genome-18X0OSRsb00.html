thanks to the decision on jun jun 2013
at western 13th 2013 on the myriad case
is that human genetic code is not
patentable however code that is
synthesized from like if you I cannot
say I patent that mutation you have
because I discovered it however if you
synthesize that DNA I think it's called
cdna that is patentable because that is
a product of human innovation so a lot
of the debate over the myriad case and
the patenting of genes has really been
about the purpose of patents in the
United States and yeah this whole
history of intellectual property
protection in the United States which is
super fun stuff that probably doesn't
need to be done in depth in a genetics
course but the purpose of the patent
code is to protect the fruits of human
innovation if you have worked on
something and you have created something
you are entitled to control it and
profit off of that for a you know
protected period of time which is
changed of course throughout patent
protection history but you're entitled
to exclusively profit off of that for a
period of time as a reward for your
labor in bringing this new thing into
the world so patenting of natural
materials has actually been there's a
pretty extensive case law that this was
not something that you could do because
you can't just you know discover a mold
scoop it out and say I patent this I get
to use this mold alone a lot of people
were arguing that genes the discovery of
a genetic mutation took so much effort
and took so much ingenuity to isolate
and to interpret this information
that that made it patentable and they're
actually uh you know Myriad's patents
were not the first to be issued mm-hmm
myriad is really just the worst behaved
patent er of a human genetic information
they didn't make any friends exactly
even since the Supreme Court decision it
seems that they're still going after
people I know that there are companies
that you know we're trying to run with
the Supreme Court decision and marry it
is still suing them yes yeah there's
plenty of cleanup work left to be done
but yeah over the course of this
litigation a lot of people were arguing
instead of invalidating patents like
this for instead having a sort of
compulsory licensing system was another
idea that is it's you know common to
further scientific innovation by
licensing your patent licensing your
discovery and the whole problem with
myriads holding of these patents that
lent all these lawsuits is they didn't
grant any licenses which was putting a
chokehold on research and of course in
individuals ability to access a
diagnostic test to determine whether or
not they had these mutations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
