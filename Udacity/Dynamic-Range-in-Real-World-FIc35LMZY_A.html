range is in real world and what kind of
images we talking about let's use that
to situate our problem I'm going to show
you a bunch of pictures that had took
around my house a while ago and again it
was a sunny day so I was able to capture
images under the Sun but at the same
time I was able to find different dark
corners and the goal here is to showcase
to you a variety of pictures taken under
different lighting conditions so for
example this is my first imagery i took
basically in a dark corner I took it
inside there is there are no lights you
know kind of illuminating any part of
that scene and even with a long exposure
you can see basically it's a dark image
with nothing there second imager took
which basically again inside but with
regular inside incandescent bulbs you
can see a little bit of the scene it's a
little bit the kind of darkish orangish
reddish kind of stuff are visible but
you can see that there is not much
detail here moving up then we go still
remain inside but this time I'm actually
near a window which basically means that
the scene is now naturally lit so
there's a little bit of detail in the
scene now you can actually see the
character in the book and everything
next when I basically now move the same
two objects outside but this time I'm
under a shade again you can notice that
from going here the amount of light is
increasing finally move to the outside
now this time under the Sun of course
I've intentionally made it sill that
there are no shadows or anything else
like that but you can see now the scene
is much much better lit for sin none of
these images I'm playing around with any
external light source like flash or
anything else like that another whole
instance would be as I could now just
take the camera and point it straight
into the Sun of course the complete
opposite of this dark image here
everything is just completely bright so
you notice now that you know there are
lots of different types of lighting
conditions and the light actually plays
a role in what kinds of images we
capture and we've discussed this when we
talked about illumination but now let's
try to understand and quantify some of
this so we can understand what are the
different ranges of light intensity
that's actually in the natural
warm and they'll be trying to capture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
