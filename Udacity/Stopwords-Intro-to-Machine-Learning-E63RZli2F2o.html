lot of information and it can be really
valuable to have an eye out for these
words and to be able to just sort of
remove them from your corpus so you
don't have to consider them you don't
allow them to become noise in your data
set in general this list of words is
called stop words and the exact
definition of what a stop word is can
vary but in general it's a low
information word that occurs very
frequently some examples might include
words like and the I you and have and a
very common pre-processing step in text
analysis is to remove the stop words
before you do anything else with the
data suppose that our body of stop words
is the in for you we'll have and B say I
just give these to you and say by Fiat
these are the stock words my question
for you in a quiz is how many words will
be removed when we remove the stop words
from the message hi Kati
the machine learning class will be great
