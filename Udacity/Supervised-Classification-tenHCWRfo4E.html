function that we build in order to the
classification and you can't really
answer that and tell me till you tell me
what good means all right and what good
means two things first of all what kinds
of mistakes does our classifier make all
right and for each of those mistakes
sort of how expensive is it to make
those mistakes and when we build a
supervised classifier or supervised
classification since we know what the
desired outputs are forgiven set and
then we can run the thing as we're
designing it what we want to do is we
want to minimize the expected miss
classification costs okay we want to
make mistakes as infrequently as
possible and the more expensive a
mistake is the less often we want to
make that a particular mistake all right
to do this to handle classification
there are two general strategies the
first method which is referred to as
generative you basically use your
training data from Class A to build a
model of class a separately you build a
model of class b you build a model of
class c you build a model of class d and
then when you give a new example you say
well does model a explain it better or
in my bottle be or model C whichever one
explains it better that's my that's the
one I pick and it's referred to as
generative because the idea is that I
have a model that describes sort of all
the different possible things that would
be of class a these that's the hope or
you could even think of it as generating
a set of examples that are Class A the
other way of doing it is referred to as
discriminative discriminative says well
here's a and here's a bunch of things
that are not a and let me learn how to
discriminate between them okay so I'm
not going to worry about modeling what
all of a is what I want to do is if i
only have a's b's and c's i have to look
at how would i discriminate between a or
B's and C's or I could also do a versus
B a versus CB versus C and and and learn
those but the discriminator the
discriminative approach focuses on
learning the boundary the separator
between
our categories today what we're going to
be doing is talking about generative and
then we'll move on to discriminate in a
couple of future lessons</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
