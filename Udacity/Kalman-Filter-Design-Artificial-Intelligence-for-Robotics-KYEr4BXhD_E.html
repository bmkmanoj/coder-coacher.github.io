need effectively two things for the
state you need a state transition
function and that's usually a matrix so
we are now in the world of linear
algebra and for the measurements you
need a measurement function so let me
give you those for our example of the 1d
motion of an object we know that the new
location is the old location plus
velocity turning this into this matrix
you have a 1 over here and a 1 over here
the new velocity should just be the old
velocity because 0 over here and a 1
over here if you multiply this matrix
for this vector this is exactly what
you're getting and for the measurement V
only observe the first component of the
place not the velocity and that uses a
vector or matrix like this so this
matrix will be called F in this H the
actual update equations for common
filter are involved and I give them to
you but please don't memorize them and I
won't prove them for you even the proof
is very involved every time I use images
look them up there's a prediction step
where I take my best estimate X
multiplied with the state transition
matrix matrix F and I add whatever
motion I know you that gives me my new X
I also have a covariance that characters
my uncertainty and that is updated as
follows where T is the transpose there's
also a measurement update step let me
use the measurement Z we compare the
measurement with our prediction where H
is the measurement function that map's
the state to measurements we call this
the error the error is mapped into a
matrix S which is obtained
by projecting the system uncertainty
into the measurement space using the
measurement function projection plus a
matrix are the characters the
measurement noise this is then mapped
into a variable called K which is often
called the common gain where we invert
the matrix S and then finally we
actually update our estimate and our
uncertainty using what ought to be the
most cryptic equation that you've seen
in a long time
now I wrote this down so that you have a
complete definition but this is
something you should not memorize if you
really wish to understand this math it
is happens to be just a generalization
of the math I gave you to higher
dimensional spaces but I would recommend
just not to worry about this there is a
set of linear algebra equations that
implement the common theta and higher
dimensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
