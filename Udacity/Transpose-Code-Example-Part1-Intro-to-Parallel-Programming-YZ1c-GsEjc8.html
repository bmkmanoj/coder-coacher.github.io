this series of coding exercises I'm
going to show you I'm gonna be
transposing a matrix and the coordinates
of this matrix are gonna be given as I
and J I refers to the column of an
element J refers to the row of an
element now this matrix is going to be
laid out in row major order meaning that
in memory all the elements of a given
row will be adjacent and in the next row
and in the next row and so on and
remember that our goal is to take for
every element IJ we want to switch it
with element ji so that's what the codes
going to do let me slide this over here
as a reference and I'll bring up the
code window so here's how you would code
transpose on a serial machine like a CPU
really simple code I'm gonna pass in two
matrices in and out and I'm gonna walk
through a for loop that loops over the
rows J and within each row loops over
the column and then this is where you
can tell that the matrix is laid out in
row major order I comma J and the input
matrix maps to J comma I in the output
matrix okay really simple and here's how
you would call that code so I'm going to
allocate a few matrices and input matrix
and an output matrix and I call this
little utility routine called fill
matrix which is just going to put a
bunch of consecutive numbers inside the
matrix I call the transpose routine and
I'm gonna put the result in the matrix I
call gold meaning that this is our
golden reference we know that this is
this code is correct and we're going to
compare the various GPU versions that we
code to this to this golden reference
and then I print it
okay so let's compile and run this code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
