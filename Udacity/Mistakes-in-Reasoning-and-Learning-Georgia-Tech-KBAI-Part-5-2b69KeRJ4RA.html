reasoning earlier in this class you may
recall this was the explanation that an
agent had built to decide why a
particular object was an instance of the
cup then we told it that it was an
incorrect decision the agent then
reflected on its knowledge here was the
knowledge hey was the explanation it had
built it is not reflecting on it and
trying to figure out what makes this
particular explanation incorrect where
does the fault lie that was an example
where the agent was reflecting on its
knowledge but has tus knowledge was
stored in the short-term memory it had
been pulled out of the long-term memory
but just like they can be added in the
knowledge they could also be potentially
be an error in the reasoning or
potentially an error in the learning
process an example of an error in
reasoning occurred very early in this
particular class you may recall this
particular diagram for mean since
analysis this was the blocks microworld
the agent needed to take this blog from
this initial state to this goal state
however they were multiple goals here d
on cable see on DB on c and as the agent
try to accomplish these goals it ran
into cul-de-sacs we're no further
progress was possible without undoing
some of the earlier goals so that was an
example of metacognition / reasoning
where the agent was trying to figure out
what was the editor in my reasoning and
how can I remedy it we can similarly
have metacognition / learning so an
example of metacognition were learning
occurred when we were talking about
learning by correcting mistakes you may
recall this was the explanation the
agent had built after it had remedied
the explanation the remedy in this
particular case was adding here that he
handle is fixed and relating it to the
rest of the explanation given that the
agent had used explanation based
learning to build this explanation in
the first place we can think of the
agent as reflecting on its process of
explanation dis learning and asking
itself what did they do wrong and then
deciding well I built the wrong
explanation I must change at explanation
and that is what learning by correcting
mistakes did we can consider this to be
a process of metacognition over learning
in the sense that the agent may say how
did I learn this particular knowledge
well I learned it to explanation this
learning so what was wrong in my process
of explanation based learning they led
to this incorrect explanation how do i
fix my processor
nation based learning so that I do not
make the same error again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
