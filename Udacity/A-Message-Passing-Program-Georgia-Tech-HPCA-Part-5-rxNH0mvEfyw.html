through let's look at the message
passing program this is a relatively
simple program what it's trying to do is
compute a sum of a relatively large
array in parallel on four cores so this
is the overall array size it has a
thousand 24 elements this is the number
of processors we have in a message
passing program each of the processors
will get one quarter of the array they
cannot access each other's memory
directly so each one of them only
allocates it's part of the array in its
memory each of them will have its own
sum variable and then what happens is
each of them iterates over each part of
the array adding those array elements to
the Sun this of course assumes that the
elements of the large array have somehow
been distributed to all of the
processors if they haven't been
distributed already then we need to also
write code that will actually send the
elements of the array so that each of
them gets a quarter of the array once we
have computed the sum we need to compute
the final sum and to do that we have to
communicate so what we will do is we
will have one of the processors act as
the summing up agent and it will for
every other processor receive the sum
sent by that processor and add it to its
sum and then print the final overall sum
what do the rest of the processors do
well what they do is they send to
processor zero
what they have collected so far and
that's all they do so as you can see we
need to explicitly send and then receive
things in order for communication
between processors to happen and also we
have to explicitly control what gets
into who's part of memory we need to
explicitly also in the program figure
out how to match the sends and receives
because if we send something and it's
not received it's going to be
problem and also if we wait to receive
something and there is no scent for it
it's gonna be a problem we get stuck
here so we need to know how many
processes to wait for we need to send
exactly what's expected at that time and
so on but once we do all of this
correctly it's very easy for the
programmer to see which parts of this
program are going to be expensive as far
as communication is concerned because
these are all local accesses so they are
relatively fast and these are the only
places where we actually communicate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
