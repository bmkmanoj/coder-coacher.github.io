cache in action we'll assume a 5-bit
adjust space with the two byte cache
lines notice that I've added a valid bit
to our cashier so that we can tell
whether data has ever been loaded up to
a line in the cache uninitialized caches
are called cold let's say that zero is
the first address in most systems that's
not allowed but it's fine for our
example the second bit here tells us the
index for the cache so we'll need to put
this in the zeroth set somewhere we put
it in here flipping the reased
recently used item to say 1 because that
would be our preferred place to write
the next cache line with index 0 maybe
after this I have an address that looks
like this 1 the index here is 1 so we
want to put it in this group and again
I'll put it in the first line setting
the valid bit writing the data and
marking the least recently used bit our
next address has index 0 so it gets
written there notice that I chose this
slot because the LRU had been 1 and I
flipped it back to 0 because this is now
the least recently used item in this
part of the cache next we have an
address with index 1 we check the tag
and we see that it's a hit oh my
goodness
notice that this address is a hit even
though we didn't read the exact same
address before but we did read an
address belonging to the same cache
block next we have another address with
index 0 so he comes in here and evicting
one of the previous entries this one
because of the LRU bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
