could solve this here's one so we're
gonna find the procedure is friend first
we need to check if the name starts with
a D if it does then our result is true
and we can return true right away if
it's not we're not done yet
we need to check if the name starts with
the letter N if it does we return true
if we got to here it didn't start with
either a D or an N so that means we
should return false let's see how that
works
so we have three tests first one starts
with the D so it should be true the
second one starts with an N should be
true and the third one starts with with
an F so it should be false
so there are lots of different ways we
could have solved this we could have
used an else here right so we could have
had an else and inside the else have the
if and if it's not then we could have an
else here and the return false that will
work just the same a bit more code but
it also shows the structure perhaps a
little better than the first one the
other thing we can do is to return the
result right away to do that we need to
introduce a new Python operator that we
haven't used yet and that's the or
operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
