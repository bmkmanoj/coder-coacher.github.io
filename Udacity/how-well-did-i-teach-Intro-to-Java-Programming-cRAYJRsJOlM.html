imagined just calculating a total for
one topic let's say it's topic 2 now for
each student I want to look at the grade
for that student for the current topic
and add it on to the sum so far this
will be the sum for this one topic I'll
initialize some for topic with zero and
then once I've calculated it I'll want
to store it in the correct spot for its
topic I'll need to make this array for
all of the totals it contains doubles
and it should have one for each topic
and then at the end I'll return all of
the totals but now I need to do this
part for all of the topics so starting
from initializing the sum to saving it I
want to indent everything and then add a
for loop that goes through all of the
topics so now that I'm controlling the
topic that I'm looking at with the for
loop it can get rid of that and now I'm
ready to try it since there are less
topics than students it's easier to tell
this time that it's right but there are
a lot of other ways that we could do
this for example I could create my array
with one spot for each topic and then I
could go through each student one
student at a time and to add their total
and add their grade to the correct total
for the correct topic and then for the
last line plus four plus six plus five
that might work too I think that's a
little more confusing to read but there
could be advantages to that way as well
I think the way that I showed was the
simplest but trying a few different ways
is good practice you can find the one
that you like best what do you like
about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
