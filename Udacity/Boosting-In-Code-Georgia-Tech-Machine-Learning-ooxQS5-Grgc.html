pseudocode okay let me read it out to
you and then you could tell me if it
makes sense so we're given a training
set it's made up of a bunch of x iy our
pairs you know X is your input and Y is
your output and for reasons that'll be
clear in a moment all of your labels are
either minus 1 or plus 1
rrah - 1 means not in a class and +1
means you're in a class so this is a
binary classification task does that
make sense so far ok and then what
you're going to do is you're going to
loop at every time step let's call it
lowercase T from the first time step 1 -
some big time in the future we'll just
call it capital T and not worry about
where it comes from right now
the first thing you're gonna do is
you're going to construct a distribution
and I'll tell you how in a minute Mike
okay so so don't worry about it and
we'll just call that D sub T so this is
your distribution over your examples and
some particular time D given that
distribution I want you to find a weak
classifier I want your weak learner to
output some hypothesis let's call that H
sub T the hypothesis that gets produced
to that time step and that hypothesis
should have some small error let's call
that error epsilon sub T because it's a
small number such that it does well on
the training set given the particular
distribution so I'm just rewriting my
notion of error from the other side of
the screen so at every time step we want
you to find a weak classifier that is we
want you to call some weak learner that
returns some hypothesis let's call it H
of T that has a small error let's call
that epsilon sub T which is to say that
the probability of it being wrong that
is disagreeing with the training label
is small with respect to the underlying
distribution so just to be clear there
the epsilon could be as big as slightly
less than 1/2 right it doesn't have to
be teeny-tiny it might actually be
almost 1/2 but it can't be bigger than
1/2 that's right and no matter what
happens or even equal to 1/2 but you
know we can assume although it doesn't
matter for the algorithm that the
learner is going to return the best one
that it can with some error but
regardless it's going to have it's going
to satisfy the requirements of a weak
learner and all
I've done is copy this notion of error
over to here okay Austin okay so you're
gonna do that and you'll do that for a
whole bunch of time steps constantly
finding hypotheses at each time step H
of T with small error epsilon sub T
constantly making new distributions and
then eventually you're gonna output some
final hypothesis which I haven't told
you yet how you're gonna get that final
hypothesis but that's the high level bit
look at your training data construct
distributions find a weak classifier
with low error keep doing that too you
have a bunch of them and then combine
them somehow into some final hypothesis
and that's the high level algorithm for
boosting okay okay but you've left out
the two really important things even
apart from how do you find a quick weak
classifier which is where do we get this
distribution and where do we get this
this final hypothesis right so let me do
that for you right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
