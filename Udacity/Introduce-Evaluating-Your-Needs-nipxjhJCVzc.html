need to grow your business the product
you build is going to involve some
combination of three basic assets skills
money and time let's have a look into
some things you'll need to consider
about each of these assets first how do
you know what skills you'll need for
your business depending on the goals you
set for yourself you'll need a different
set of skills to get the job done there
are plenty of ways to find the people
you need to get these skills for your
team we'll talk about this later but
first it's important to define the
skills you'll actually need common
skills you'll need our engineers
salespeople marketers and operations try
thinking of the goals you set in terms
of the skills it takes to complete them
once you determine which skills you need
you'll need money to get some help
common ways to find the skills you need
are through hiring outsourcing and
freelancing there's a lot that goes into
this and you don't need to worry about
it quite yet but try thinking about the
skills you need in terms of how you plan
to pay someone to get them and as you
build your team you're really trading
money for time your goal is to reduce
the amount of time it takes to complete
your goals by getting the right people
for the job you also increase how
quickly you provide value to your users
your team will help you experiment
iterate and operate more quickly and
effectively this helps keep you
innovative and profitable moving forward
take some time to consider how you'll
use these three assets as you continue
to grow your business</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
