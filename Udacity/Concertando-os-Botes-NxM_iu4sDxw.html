simply select the years but in container
again which is the parent div that we
attached a class 2 and then select all
the divs contained within our years
buttons div which corresponds to each
individual button which we can then add
our styling to and once we've selected
all the individual buttons again a
select all should return 20 buttons we
make a smooth transition using d threes
animation functions and then set the
initial stylings on the buttons that
they have before they're clicked and
since we're adding this code before we
update the butt end is actually clicked
we don't have to worry about having the
clicked button not be updated so first
we change all the buttons back including
the button that was clicked back to
their initial styles and then once
everything is reset we can go back and
find the button that was clicked and
only update that single button so as you
can see here we've refreshed the page we
have our map which represents the state
of the world cup in 2014 and we have our
buttons now let's see what happens when
we click an individual button has
happened before the map has correctly
updated and the buttons color has
correctly changed and now let's see if
our updates to the buttons which
shouldn't be clicked has worked as you
can see here the previous button we
clicked has gone back to its initial
styling the maps updated and the current
click button has changed the blue and
again going to 1930 we can see this
transition happened smoothly and
everything seems to be working now
that's the end of the live code example
and everything will be covering in this
course but don't feel like this is the
limit of what we can do with the map or
d3 in general I want to just recap what
we did in this lesson since we did a lot
of coding and hopefully I've inspired
you to go out and create your own
visualizations or adapt what we've
created in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
