i'm joined here by my co-host Andy
thanks for joining us Andy thanks for
having me Lauren I'm really excited to
be here let's start by telling some of
our viewers at home what we're going to
be doing in the sense of limb but it
sounds like a good idea so we're going
to six events and we're going to using
our co-workers as sense leads now each
of these events is going to somehow test
or push the limits of human sense and
perception and first we have a touch
event and in this event we're going to
be measuring what's called a difference
threshold so basically measuring our sin
slates ability to detect small changes
in weight then we're going to move on to
one of our chemical senses that's taste
followed by our main events that focus
on hearing and seeing so we all know
humans have five senses they have sight
hearing taste smell and touch and to go
along with each of those five senses are
our five sense organs we have eyes ears
nose tongue and skin and it's through
these organs that we receive all of our
sensory information about the world
that's true Andi but our sense organs
you're just the beginning of the process
they only let us sense things not
necessarily perceive them you're right
and this is a really important
distinction sensation versus perception
so sensation is really the taking in of
input it's the sights and the sounds
whereas perception is the understanding
and interpreting of these inputs so
really it's the senses or sensations
together with the brain or a perception
that are part of really the same process
responding adaptively to our environment
so what's really important here is that
we see feel touch taste and here just as
much with our brain as we do with our
sense organs sensation is just the
beginning of the process whereas
perception is the end of the process oh
excuse me I'm getting word from our
grounds correspondent Susan there are
since leets are lining up to begin you
know why we're waiting for them to start
and you do mind telling the people at
home what it takes to be a sin sleep
absolutely Lauren so one thing we can
expect to see today from our real
all-star content
it's some exquisite transduction now
transduction is something you may not be
familiar with it's how we convert the
physical stimulus and the physical
energy associated with that into neural
energy in the form of neural impulses
for example when light waves become
neural impulses from the photoreceptors
on our retina that's true learn but I
think we're getting a little ahead of
ourselves I'm sorry I just get really
excited about sensation of perception
it's okay Lauren we all do it's going to
be a great day in the history of sense
Olympics though the Annie you do know
it's going to be the only day in the
history since olympics you don't know
that this might be a continuing event I
hope so anyways before we begin the
first event we'd love to thank our
sponsors who helped make this a reality
pain away sniff book mega dog 30,000
desa boost and Odin's eye monocles
they've generously donated to make this
event happen so now to our ground
correspondent Susan are you ready</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
