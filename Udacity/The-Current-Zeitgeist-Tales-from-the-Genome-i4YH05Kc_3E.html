other people view the information that
you might find out is this information
you're comfortable sharing with anybody
only your family only yourself I'm
extremely concerned about insurance
companies getting ahold of this
information and and that that
pre-existing condition aspect because i
really really need my insurance company
currently and in the future so you're
most concerned that they would
essentially not um they wouldn't carry
you anymore for especially if they were
job change and we're starting with a new
insurance company now you know
supposedly Obamacare kind of does away
with that but what happens when Obama
goes away any other thoughts
specifically about insurance companies
from anybody I just think there's like
she's saying there's a lot of potential
for sons for people to take this
information and exploit exploit people
with certain traits or certain thing
with certain yeah but certain traits are
with people who are confirmed with
certain conditions so I think yeah the
other one would be a potential employer
you know they had the information that
we could be out on medical leave a lot
for surgeries for our children searchers
I think one thing that is also different
about me than you all is that there are
five of us in our family with a
conflation so insurance companies are a
really big deal in our house the thought
of losing that and or my husband losing
a potentially a job offer if the
employer said to himself or herself hmm
this could be a very expensive employee
our rates are going to go up and he's
going to be out of work a lot dealing
with either his sir
or one of them is for family members
would better not touch this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
