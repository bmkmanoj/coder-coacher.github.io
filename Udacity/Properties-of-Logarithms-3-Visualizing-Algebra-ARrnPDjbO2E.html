of 6 great work if you found this
logarithm now again I think it's easiest
to think about having two logarithms a
base B of eight and three logarithms of
base B of four we know that to combine
these three logarithms or to add them
together we'll need to multiply these
numbers together so we can express the
addition of these three logarithms as
the logarithm of base B of 6 times 8
times 8 then we'll have the subtraction
of log base B of four three times when
we subtract a logarithm we really divide
this number into this number keep in
mind this is only true if the logarithms
have the same base so when I combine
this logarithm with this logarithm will
really just divide 6 times 8 times 8 by
four and we'll take the log of base B of
that expression these other two
logarithms are still on the end and
notice that I'm going to have to repeat
this process so if i take this logarithm
with base B and subtract this logarithm
with base B i'm going to divide by
another four so we divide by another
four and then I still have one more
logarithm on the end i need to subtract
this logarithm with base B of four from
this logarithm with base B of this
expression so I'm simply dividing by
another for this gives me a logarithm
with one number now I just need to
simplify I know 8 times 8 equals 64 and
four times four times four also equals
64 so these factors simplify to 1 which
leaves me with log base B of 6 or final
