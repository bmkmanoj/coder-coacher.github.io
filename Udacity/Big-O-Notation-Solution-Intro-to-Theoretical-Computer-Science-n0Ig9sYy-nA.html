think that algorithm a would be
preferable to algorithm B because the
running time of algorithm a is 3 and
squared minus n plus 10 and here we have
2 to the power of n so just ask with the
algorithm of Alice this function here
will grow very fast if and increases but
of course this is only a very general
statement so in general you have to be a
bit more careful about choosing
algorithms even if the running times
deviate like this because as we said
before we are taking worst case running
times so maybe the average case running
time of algorithm B is much better than
of algorithm a and also we might be
dealing with very small inputs so if you
would know that n for example doesn't
get much bigger than 10 then those two
algorithms are almost equal or sometimes
even algorithm B would be preferable but
in general if you don't have any other
information I would go with algorithm a
because the running time is much lower
than the running time here as long as n
is not very small</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
