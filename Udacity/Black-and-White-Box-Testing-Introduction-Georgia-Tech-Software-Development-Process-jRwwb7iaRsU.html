in the next two lessons we're going to
talk about two main families of testing
techniques blackbox testing techniques
and white box testing techniques so what
I want to do before get into the
discussion of the specific techniques in
these families I want to give you an
overview of what blackbox testing and
white box testing are black box testing
is the kind of testing in which we
consider the software as a closed box
that's why it's called black box so we
don't look inside the software we don't
want to look at the code we're just
going to look at the description of the
software so this is the testing that is
based on a description of the software
which is what we normally call a
specification for the software and what
black box testing tries to do is to
cover as much specified behavior as
possible and the main limitation of
black box testing and the reason why
these complimentary to white box testing
is that it can't reveal false due to
implementation details conversely white
box testing is the kind of testing that
looks inside the box
so looks at the code and how the code is
written and uses this information to
perform the testing so white box testing
is based on the code its goal is to
cover as much coded behavior in this
case as possible and it's limitation is
that unlike black box testing it can't
reveal errors due to missing paths we're
missing paths are part of the software
specification that are not implemented
and the reason why it cannot reveal them
is because it is focused on the code and
not on the specification</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
