looked at the HTML phones but there's a
lot more going on in here so how I mean
how do you think about approaching a new
program like this well so there's always
going to be some files these guys that
have a point for being there but they
aren't really essential to understanding
the functionality of the program okay so
I sort of ignored those guys and go
straight for the you know the things
that really change how the program looks
and how it operates okay so if we look
here in the JavaScript we'll see a bunch
of a bunch of files including some that
are you know sort of less useful when it
comes to understanding how the program
works okay so like the here we are in
the JavaScript for you and in frame
underscore polyfill is so this this guy
isn't gonna really give you a lot of
information about how the game functions
and how do you know that you can just
sort of look there's not really a lot
happening here that has to do with like
the tiles on the on the page moving
around or anything like that it's just
sort of something you have to get a feel
for so this this guy seems to be doing
something it's creating a game manager
which sounds like you know something to
do with the game so that's probably
defined in here okay and it looks like
this guy has a lot of functions that do
stuff with the game so this this is
probably a good place to start looking
okay at what the overall structure of
the program looks like and then just
keep going from there until you're
satisfied that you understand things
okay so I know you took some time to
make a pretty thing I want to pull it up
I'm lying this is my handwriting yeah I
did it for you but these are the big
these are the big files that you are the
most important in terms of functionality
the game the index the main file that
whole JavaScript folder with a couple of
exceptions
yeah that's things that weren't quite as
important the polyfill functions or
files especially and then these seven D
seven folders so if we were gonna do our
sorry D seven JavaScript files yeah so
if we were going to add an undo button I
mean where's the majority of the work
gonna take place
would it be in the index would it be in
the main or would it be somewhere in
these JavaScript files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
