to show you a fairly naive brute force
solution to this that is definitely
vulnerable to some things so first off
we start off with the checks a dogu
function from the first problem exact
same function as a base for solving this
video keyboard after that solve sudoku
is actually fairly short if not exactly
pretty import copy insists here and copy
is the only one who you use here sis is
used down below for something else
entirely it was for testing purposes
first we check the grid with check
sodoku and if check so who returns none
or false we return the result you could
also assert here I wanted to be able to
continue on for for testing purposes so
I just returned the result instead of
asserting that although asserting would
definitely be a good idea here as well
and we used deep copy to copy this over
and not going to get into what exactly
cut the copy package and deep copy is
suffice to say that we made a copy of
the initial input into another variable
now we check through the grid for zero
elements and we change them to each of
one through nine and then recursively
call solve sudoku on the results so this
is a very very slow proof force process
but it's also fairly easy to code up as
well so for each element in the grid we
check with 0 and then for all n in the
range 1 through 10 so all elements 1
through 9 then we set that grid position
to that number and then we call saul
pseudo go again if this new grid is in
false then we return it otherwise we
backtrack
and that's it that's all there is to
that it's really pretty simple there are
a lot of ways you could really really
mess with this if you wanted it to take
a very very long time for instance and i
invite you to break it in the forms just
to check real quick let's check that my
solution actually works and this is for
all of the all the inputs that we gave
as example test cases you can see that
it does verify that the first to the
hill formed and invalid ones didn't work
and then for the valid one and easy we
didn't do hard simply because it would
take this algorithm a little bit longer
to do that and I didn't want to wait so
that it shows that the valid and full
already solved board is the exact same
and the easy board it's filled out with
a valid su doku board solution so okay
see I hope you enjoyed that and I hope
you enjoyed looking at everyone else's
code and seeing how everyone thought
about the problem and how you might
think about testing the problem itself
so i hope you had a lot of fun with that
see you in the next unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
