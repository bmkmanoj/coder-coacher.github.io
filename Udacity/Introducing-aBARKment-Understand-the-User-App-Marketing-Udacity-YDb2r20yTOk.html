market segmentation we're gonna dive
into some exercises and we want you to
be able to be involved even if you don't
have an idea of your own yet so Ronnie
and I had some exciting news we want to
share with you we decided to create
abarkment like many entrepreneurs our
idea came from passion and need lauren
is obsessed with dogs that's that's very
true and I'm passionate about finding
good safe and fun place for my dog to
stay while I travel for work so Ronnie
needs reliable and affordable place for
a dog and I need to spend more time with
dogs because I can't have my own right
now plus I could use the extra cash we
figured we were not alone in how he felt
and what we needed so we decided to
create the bargman a safe home for your
dog to stay in with people we're excited
to spend time with your dog while you're
away so the idea is simple you sign up
for our app as either a sitter and tell
us your availability in about the
environment you'll be keeping the
visiting dog in or sign up as an owner
and tell us what you're looking for in a
sitter and when you'll be away we will
mesh you with the best sitter for your
dog at a reasonable price so we need to
use market segmentation to come up with
a marketing plan obviously the first
guys should be sitters versus owners but
even within each of these we have to
understand who are the different users
and who to focus on why don't you join
our team and help us conduct a market
segmentation for abarkment you can start
with 1 practice of market segmentation
and then try another until you have a
solid segmentation of the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
