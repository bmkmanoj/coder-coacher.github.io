caused by stock splits why do stocks
split the most common reason and as far
as I know the only reason is that the
price is too high
why is a high price a problem
well consider for a moment that stock
may be above say $500 per share people
like to buy stocks in groups of 100 so
that means for instance it would be
$50,000 to buy or sell a block of a
hundred shares of a 500 dollar stock now
of course you can buy it in smaller
blocks that's fine but another aspect is
that options when they're traded on
stocks are usually traded with regard to
100 shares so options covering a hundred
shares of $500 stocks becomes suddenly
very expensive and less liquid so from
the point of view of options and also
individual stock shares very high prices
are a problem even in the case where you
want to buy just one share of a stock
you know let's suppose you're setting
your kid up with a an account and you
want to buy one share of Apple earlier
this year that would have cost you $600
so even buying one share of a very
expensive stock can be a problem finally
one other issue here is if you're
building a portfolio and you want to
have a finely-tuned proportion of each
stock in your portfolio if some of the
price if some of the stock prices are
very high it becomes difficult to get
that fine resolution that you want so
when the prices get very very high what
the companies do is they say look let's
take that one share that's priced at
$300 and break it into four shares at
seventy five so that's called a four for
one split in this case we had a two for
one split okay so that's why splits
happen now let's look at this data
suppose you read this data into your
computer and you were going to analyze
it and look for trading opportunities
well your algorithm
might discover hey look here's a great
shorting opportunity whenever this
condition occurs whatever that was you
ought to short the stock and then you'll
see a 75% drop and you'll reap a
significant reward and also here you
might identify this time as a good
opportunity to short as well well of
course that's wrong
because what's happening underneath is
that the value of the company isn't
really decreasing you just have more
shares so if you want to trade using
this actual closed data you have to
account for all these splits and that
becomes cumbersome so someone came up
with a great solution to this problem
namely adjusted clothes or adjusted
prices and the idea is to create a
timeline of prices that are adjusted to
account for these changes such that you
can look back over adjusted clothes
simulate buying at a particular time and
seeing how the value increases over time
accurately without having to account for
these splits here's how it works
the first thing to point out is that at
the very last day in other words today
adjusted clothes and actual clothes are
always the same
now we track back in time and adjusted
clothes and actual clothes are exactly
the same but then on this day when we
see this two-to-one split what we do is
we go back over all the historical data
and we divide it all by two so the first
day before this split we get about a
hundred and twenty-five dollar price
instead of that 250 then when we get to
this four to one split we divide by 2
and then by 4 so that on this one day
before that split our price is in the
neighborhood of about 70 dollars and
that continues back in time and we as we
go back we adjust for each of the splits
in history so now we have a nice smooth
move price timeline without these big
jumps and for instance if you considered
that you bought the stock on this day
and held it until this day the
accumulation and value that you see
there is accurate it reflects all those
splits and you know you would have a lot
more shares here but this would also
correctly represent the increase in
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
