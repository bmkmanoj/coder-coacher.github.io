expressions to classify or layout sets
of strings it turns out that grammars
can encode all of these regular
languages or regular expressions that
we've been working with previously here
I've written a grammar for a number
that's going to recognize exactly the
same language exactly the same set of
strings as the regular expression above
we can rewrite number to be a digit
followed by more digits and this
construction is meant to mimic or get
the same idea as this plus we need at
least one but we could have some more
down here I've just listed out all of
the digits long hand well I haven't on
this particular page but you could
imagine I could write out two through
eight as optional alternate rewrite
rules in our grammar more digits is
where a lot of the action happens one
possibility is that we have one digit
followed by potentially even more and
another is that we give up I could write
epsilon this means more digits goes to
nothing so for example down here at the
bottom I have a derivation starting with
number getting to the number 42 number
goes to digit more digits using our
first rule rule number one and then
we're going to turn more digits into
digit more digit using rule number two
and then oh my gosh classic professor
mistake you cannot take me anywhere
Shoop Oh we'll look at wraps that was
amazing and then from digit digit more
digits we're going to turn more digits
into the empty string using rule three
so now we're left with digit digit
nothing and I'm going to turn that
second digit into a to this empty string
isn't really there then I'll turn that
first digit into a fork huzzah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
