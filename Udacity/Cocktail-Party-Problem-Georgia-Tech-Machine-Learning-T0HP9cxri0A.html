page we will provide a link to it on our
own web pages and you'll notice there's
a really nice copy right here and this
is all free to use so I'm not I'm not
doing anything wrong here they're going
to use independent components analysis
as a way of recovering original sounds
so here you see that I've clicked onto a
police car somebody talking in a
commercial and let's say this dude here
and what it's going to do is it's going
to generate sounds for each of these
three sources that are all independently
generated and it's going to mix them so
if I click on these icons here of these
microphones see these look just like
what I drew before you'll be able to
hear each of their sounds combined
together so I'm gonna put my microphone
very close to it so you can hear the
other matters now with the
multi-millionaire camera and here's a
another one of the microphones okay so
Michael do could you hear that yes okay
so what I did is I played two of the the
mixed sounds together and you know to
the untrained ear they sound very much
alike but I think the the most important
thing is all three of these sounds are
over on top of one another and as human
beings we actually do a pretty good job
of being able to focus on one of them
because I don't know we're designed to
do that but machines have historically
had a terrible time of doing this and
independent component analysis was the
first sort of generic algorithm that was
able to solve this so we're going to use
ICA now to separate the sound sources
and as you see we get these little
gramophone things and I'm going to play
each one of these and see if they did a
good job of separating us into the
original sources say pomato main
component canaan illusio loss or EXO
theater - ultimate nstac in Kazakhstan
final tally the guardians of the
electronic stock market Nasdaq who have
been burned by past ethics questions or
okay so was that kind of cool Michael I
mean we took these completely mixed up
sounds that we were able to recover the
original by using independent components
analysis that's fascinating I don't
still understand what it's doing but
it's pretty neat that it could do that
because it sounded pretty mixed up to me
well it was it was in fact each one of
these three sources that we eventually
heard were in fact arbitrarily linearly
combined into each of these separate
microphones and there's really sort of
no way in which you'd be able to recover
the original sound because there's no
reason for you to be able to do that but
people do it all the time and now it's
something like independent components
analysis you can also do it and the
reason it works with independent
components analysis and that fundamental
assumption that it's making is that
whatever is generating in these cases
these sounds the sources are
statistically independent of one another
which happens to be true in that case
and they're combined together in a way
that is a linear combination now there's
a lot of details here and again when you
read the material to see exactly how the
independent components analysis works
but intuitively all it's doing is taking
this particular model and by using
mutual information directly to find
things that are independent of one
another while not losing any information
from the observables it's able to
reconstruct these sounds and it's able
to do this incredibly quickly and
incredibly well under a large number of
conditions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
