that I want to mention before we move to
the behavioral ones the first one is the
component diagram a component diagram is
a static view of the components in a
system and of their relationships more
precisely and node in a component
diagram represents a component or a
component consists of one or more
classes with a well-defined interface
edges conversely indicate relationships
between the components and you can read
this relationship as component a uses
services of component B and notice that
component diagrams can be used to
represent an architecture which is a
topic that we will cover extensively in
the next mini-course so let's illustrate
this with an example so what I'm
representing here is a component diagram
for our example system the course
management system as you can see is
slightly more complex than the other
diagrams that we saw but there's really
no need to go through all the steps and
all the details the important thing is
to point out some key aspects of this
diagram so the first one is that this
rectangular nodes are the nodes in the
system so are my components for example
student is a component schedule is a
component and so on and as far as edges
are concerned and representing two kinds
of edges
the first kind are dashed edges which
were part of the original UML definition
and they indicate use so an edge for
example between this component and this
component indicates that the seminar
management uses the facilities component
more recently in UML to a richer
representation was introduced which is
the one that I'm also showing here so if
we look at this part of the diagram you
can see this sort of a new lollipop
socket representation and in this case
what this represents is that a lollipop
indicates a provided interface so an
interface that is provided by the
component so for example this security
component provides encryption
capabilities the socket conversely
indicates a required interface so for
example in this case it's saying that
the facilities component is needing
access control capabilities which by the
way is provided by the security
component so in a sense these sockets
and lollipop indicate interfaces between
a provider of some some functionality
and the client of their functionality
and you can look at those as basically
api's so sets of methods that provide a
given functionality to give another
example if we look at the persist
component the persistence component
provides a surprisingly persistence
services and those persistence services
are required by several other components
in the system and in turn the persistent
component relies on the University
database component to provide such
services so there's the University B
components provide this kind of
low-level database services that are
used by the persistence component to
intern provided services last thing I
want to note is that components or
relationships can be annotated so for
example if we look at the seminar
management and the student
administration components you can see
that they're annotated here to indicate
that their user interfaces so that's all
I wanted to say on the component
diagrams but again the key piece of
information is that they represent
components in the system where a
component consists of one or more
classes indicate the interfaces that
these components provide or require and
describe the interactions between these
components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
