I'm kind of done with solution concepts
right so I said that we've done Nash
equilibrium we did sub game perfect we
have now done correlated equilibrium and
we're not going to talk about any of
these other things so I guess we're done
I was really hoping that we would talk
about at least the cocoa thing I think
we said in the in a summary that there's
more to say about that well there's more
to say about everything Michael but that
doesn't mean that we have to say just
because we can do something it does not
follow that we should so but I mean Coco
is interesting in some of the same ways
that correlated equilibria interested in
sort of goes a little bit beyond it in
some ways like I feel like I feel like
it would kind of round out the story
really nicely okay well you know i'm a
big fan of story rounding outing so with
TD TD MDT i am more than happy to let
you do that would you like to oh sure
yeah I can do that ok well then here's
the pin great so if you just don't mind
great now I will take it from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
