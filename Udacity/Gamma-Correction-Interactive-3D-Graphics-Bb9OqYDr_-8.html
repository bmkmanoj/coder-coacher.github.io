gamma correction we have two separate
wishes we want to compute our renderings
in a linear space and we want to
compensate for the power curve of
monitors when we're displaying and it's
simplest the equations just this you
take the computed channel value you
raise it to the 1 over 2.2 power and
that gives you the value you need to
display this value of 2.2 is called the
gamma correction value older Mac
displeased use 1.8 or so but now 2.2 is
the norm for all monitors for example
say we have a value of 1.0 0.6 0.2 in
our linear compute space we raise 1 to
this power and we get one back 0.6
raised to the power gets zero point
seven nine three finally zero point two
gives us zero point four eight 1 notice
how each channel changes by a different
factor one didn't change at all zero
point two more than doubles this is why
color shifting can occur if you don't
gamma correct gamma correction is
something that's applied to the whole
image just before display if you try to
do it yourself you have to be aware of
precision problems with your input data
for example if you have only 8 bits per
channel coming in you won't be able to
get 8 bits of good data coming out the
good news is that 3 Jas has gamma
correction built in all you have to do
for it is ask one last detail is that
when you look at a color swatch or a
texture on the screen you're seeing the
monitors power pure version of the data
if you want to use that data properly
when computing lighting effects you
actually have to raise each channels
value to a power of two point two before
using it for anything either making MIT
Maps or making images themselves three
Jas uses an on-the-fly approximation
squaring the textures color when it's
sampled to sum up whatever we see on the
screen is in this nonlinear gamma space
to use it in lighting computations we
want to make the data linear so we raise
each channels value to the 2.2 power we
perform our lighting calculations then
at the end we go back to the monitor
space by raising to 1 over 2.2 here are
the corresponding 3j s calls some GPUs
and api's have built-in capabilities for
dealing with gamma properly
unfortunately these aren't currently
accessible through WebGL or 3j s
internally in 3j s there's some
approximation of gamma so a value might
be squared instead of raised to the 2.2
power to bring it into linear
computation space to see the
of gamma correction take a look at the
demo that follows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
