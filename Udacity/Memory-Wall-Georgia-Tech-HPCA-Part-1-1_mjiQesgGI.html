and the performance improvements that we
expect to follow is the so called memory
wall here's why we have it the processor
speed in terms of instructions per
second we have already said it can be
expected to roughly double every let's
say two years memory capacity which is
how many gigabytes of memory can we have
in the same size module is also doubling
every two years but memory latency that
is how long does it take to do a memory
operation has only been improving about
1.1 times every two years so over time
as years go by if we plot the speed of
processors in memory we get something
like this an exponential curve for the
processors and we get another
exponential curve but that grows a lot
slower for memories this here is the gap
between processor performance and memory
performance at some time and then
several years later we have a much wider
gap this problem is often called the
memory wall basically our processors are
getting a lot faster then memories are
yet they have to access memory every so
many instructions and because this
difference in speed has been growing
very quickly over many years we have
been using caches as a sort of stairs
for the memory wall so processors now
are accessing caches which are fast and
only those rare accesses that Miss in
the cache will end up going to the slow
main memory we will spend several our
lessons talking about how to do caches
and so on but this is just one of the
trends that we have to worry about when
we design processors is that they do get
faster but if the memory doesn't get
faster as quickly as they do we have to
continuously keep improving our caches
just to allow the processors to not
suffer from the much much slower memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
