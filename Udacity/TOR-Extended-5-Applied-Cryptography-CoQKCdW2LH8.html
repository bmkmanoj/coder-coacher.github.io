are subjective but here is my answer I
believe that the most severe threat is
if Alice's onion proxy is compromised if
an attacker has access to Alice's onion
proxy if Alice's onion proxy is
compromised an attacker can learn all of
Alice's traffic the least severe threat
is option a if an attacker in the middle
intercepts the relay extend request
between Onion Router to and onion or two
out of three in attempts to set up a
different difficulty the hash check will
detect this problem and so I think this
is the least threatening between E&amp;amp;F I
think that E is more threatening than F
having control of the entry and exit
nodes is more powerful than having
control of just the entry and some node
in the middle and so now we need to
figure out where to put D and B I think
that d is a weaker threat than f just
being able to observe network traffic is
not very useful if you cannot correlate
anything having control of two routers
will give an attacker some ability to
correlate traffic perhaps through timing
attacks so d is a weaker attack than F I
think that B is a more serious threat
than e if an attacker controls the
directory server it could possibly
return only nodes under its control then
having control of three nodes is a more
serious threat than having control of
only two notes so my answer is C be e F
D and a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
