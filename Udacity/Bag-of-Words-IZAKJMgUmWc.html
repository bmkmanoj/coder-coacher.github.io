bunch of details for example which
features are we going to use to make the
code words what size should there be
when you do a vector quantization
sometimes it'll tell you how many code
words thinks it needs or sometimes you
give it a number we're not going to talk
about that and we're not even gonna talk
about the clustering or the vector
quantization algorithm instead we're
gonna focus on how would you use that in
a way that relates to the SVM's that we
just talked about in order to do
recognition so what we do is we're gonna
continue with our analogy to documents
so here I have two different documents
and if you take a look at the document
on the left you'll see a whole bunch of
words in here right sensory brain visual
perception etc nerve image Hubel Wiesel
you're building Wiesel by the way our
people want a Nobel Prize for
understanding what goes on in the visual
cortex of the cat all right
and here's another document China trade
surplus exports domestic foreign
increased trade value notice that what's
in the magnifying glasses are not
ordered it's just the words that happen
to be in that document it's like you
stuck all the words in a bag and that's
where we get this notion of bag of words
okay and the goal of what we're going to
talk about now is to go from object
recognition and map that onto a bag of
words and in the document world you know
one way of doing it is I have my bag of
words and I say what is the distribution
of words in this document and if I
wanted to do document retrieval I want
to find other similar documents a simple
thing you might do is find other
documents that have sort of the same
histogram distribution of words and that
that's likely to be a matching document
things are much more sophisticated now
in terms of how that works but it's the
basic idea is that I've got these code
words that represent or these words that
represent something about the semantics
and so a similarity and distribution
tells me that maybe there's a good
chance that it's similar type of
document so we want to do this in
computer vision
so that's notionally represented here so
I've got a bunch of different objects
and I compute my features over all of
these different objects and I come up
with what's shown down here and I think
this slide originally is from Fei Fei
I'm not sure and
all of these these are all of my code
words for all of my different objects
right so I take all my objects and it's
kind of like if you take all the
documents in a library in the United
States and if they're all in English you
took all of those documents together all
of the words would be the set of the
words that span all of those documents
right and in fact there are many more
documents than there are words and in
fact if you think of important words
words that X I have a lot of meaning
there's way more documents than words so
given a collection of words visual words
for every document I can say how many of
each word is in each document and that's
what these histograms are meant to
represent right so you know the bicycle
has got these little bicycle pieces in
it
all right and something that might kind
of look like this I don't know maybe you
know this brown part down here looks a
little bit like that brown part down
there but the idea is that there's many
more the bicycle elements than there are
of the violin elements this is referred
to as a bag of visual words for obvious
reasons and the idea is that you're
describing the entire image just by the
histogram or the collection of those
words and the and you want to do access
the same way they did in the documents
