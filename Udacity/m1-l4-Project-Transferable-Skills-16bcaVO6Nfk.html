computer science degree to be successful
as a ruby developer I went to art school
which doesn't seem to have anything to
do with code but it was still an
extremely valuable set of experiences
that I was able to bring with me for
example one of the most important parts
of art school is critique where we give
each other feedback on our work through
this process I learn how to accept an
internalized criticism in a way that
helps me work well with others on team
think about some of your own experiences
that you're bringing with you into the
standard degree program whether you're
coming from sales have worked for family
business or our sole student everyone
comes to code with some sort of
transferable skill or knowledge take a
moment to reflect on some of your own
transferable skills</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
