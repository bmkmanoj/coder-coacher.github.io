that a ListView is just one type of an
adapter view another type of adapter
view that we looked at it was grid view
so here we are looking at the ListView
documentation and in it we see the class
hierarchy diagram for the ListView
remember that a tree diagram shows what
class inherits from another class and at
each level the code was extended and
then extra code was added via a subclass
now from this diagram we can verify that
the ListView is a subclass of the
adapter view class an adapter view has
fields and methods for a view group
whose children are populated from an
adapter and the ListView can inherit
States and methods from this adapter
view class and then add on its own code
to customize it for the specific list
case let's take a look more closely at
the set on item click listener method so
this method is actually defined in the
adapter view superclass so let's click
into it and notice when we dive deeper
into it we jump into the adapter view
reference page so to reiterate be set on
item click listener what's defined in
the adapter view class now the adapter
view defines the input of this method to
be an on item click listener object
which is defined within the adapter view
class so let's click into that so this
on item click listener object is defined
within the adapter view class and that's
why it's referred to as adapter view dot
on item click listener</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
