happens to load and store instructions
just like we had data dependencies that
go through registers this is for example
why we did register renaming to
eliminate false dependencies through
registers and why we're doing these
reservation stations and so on in order
to kind of obey properly the true
dependencies there can be dependencies
through memory because loads and stores
in this case are the only instructions
that can have dependencies through
memory but there can be dependencies a
read after write dependence occurs if
there is for example a store word to
some address in memory and then we do a
load word from that address then there
is definitely a read after write
dependence between the store and a lot
basically the load uses the value put
there by the store we can also have a
write after read false dependence for
example we can have the program that
first needs to load something then store
it if we reorder this then the load gets
a value from the store not the value
from before and finally we can have a
write after write dependence if there
are two stores that store to the same
address the last one should kind of
leave the value at the end of that
sequence but if we reorder them then the
value in the memory ends up being the
kind of stale value from the first of
the stores so obviously dependencies
from memory
need to be obeyed or eliminated just
like the register ones do so what do we
do about these dependencies in
tomasulo's algorithm we do loads and
stores in order basically we don't try
to reorder them when as we issue these
instructions we put them in the load
orders or queue and then we just follow
the order of these instructions so for
example a load doesn't execute if there
is a previous store pending even though
maybe the load is ready to go but the
store still is waiting for something the
second option is to actually identify
dependencies between load stores etc and
then reorder them just like we did
normal instructions etc but this turns
out to be more complicated than doing it
for register based dependencies so we
are not gonna do that and that's why for
tomasulo's algorithm they chose not to
do this for memory instructions but they
choose to do do it for other
instructions modern processors actually
do identify dependencies reorder
etcetera even for loads and stores but
we will consider later how that is done
so so for tomasulo's algorithm this was
really kind of the you know option that
they chose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
