your boats going forwards through the
water with some velocity will call v
well actually anything you used to
calculate your speed at sea is called a
log and why is it called that well the
reason it's called a vlog is because
what mariners used to do was throw an
actual log over the back of the boat
they would let the lava flow as the boat
continued forward and as it did this
would play out some rope tied in this
rope were some knots and by counting the
number of knots they could infer the
boat speed this is where the term knots
comes from in reference to a ship speed
now you may be saying this is a
ridiculous way to measure speed how
accurate could this whole procedure be
anyways well you're right this is not
the best way of measuring speed but it
was somewhat functional at the time so
what do you think are the problems with
this method is it a problem that the
line could stretch that it's hard to
accurately measure time or what about
currents maybe there's some lateral
currents in the water behind the boat
check all that you think apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
