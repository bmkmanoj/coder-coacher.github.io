forgotten how to solve equations that's
awesome it's gonna help us a lot in
algebra moving forward let's look at a
new equation we have 3 over X minus 1
over 5 is equal to 7 just like the last
example we have two fractions but this
time there's not an X anywhere in the
second fraction we have two choices as I
see it or at least two choices in terms
of how to start the problem
the first choice that I see is the first
step we could take would be to combine
the two fractions that are on the
left-hand side that's definitely an
option but there's another choice we
could isolate the terms or term in this
case involving X on the left-hand side
and move everything else over to the
right-hand side I have a feeling that
it's going to be a little bit less work
if we go with the second option I'll put
a link to how to do the problem in the
other way in the lesson notes but for
now let's go with this method so our
goal right off the bat is to get this
term by itself on the left-hand side so
for the equation that I want you to
write in this box
I'd like you to isolate the term with X
on the left-hand side get everything
else on the right-hand side and simplify
it so that it's written as an improper
fraction what do you get then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
