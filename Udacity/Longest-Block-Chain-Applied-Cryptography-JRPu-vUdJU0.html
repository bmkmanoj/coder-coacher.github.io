each time step a new block is created
that validates all the transactions in
that block at the point where this block
is created this has to be the largest
the longest blockchain that's the way
that Bob can validate that this was a
valid spend someone could try to create
an alternate blockchain so if Bob wants
to spend the coin twice what Bob would
need to do is create a chain that's
longer than the longest chain when a
transaction is validated by the network
all the signatures in the coin are
checked this is using the transfer chain
but to prevent double spending there's
also a check of this chain of blocks and
the check is the longest chain is the
one that's viewed as correct so each
pair in the network might see a
different view of this chain of blocks
if they see different views the one that
has the longest chain is the one that
will be viewed as the most correct view
of all the transactions so every
participant in the network is
effectively keeping track of all
transactions and the version of all
transactions that people trust the most
is the one with the longest chain and if
an adversary wants to create a longer
chain with a different view of
transactions so if Bob wants to double
spend this coin and say give it the same
coin - both Kathie and Doug what Bob
would need to do is create a longer
chain that convinces Doug that this is
the correct view of the network and this
view is incorrect
so that requires finding these hash
values if the power of the network
exceeds the power of the adversary well
then it's likely the network will have a
longer chain than the adversary can
produce and keep in mind the motivation
for producing this attack is just to be
able to double spend one coin there's
still the chain of public key signatures
that validates the transfers of each
coin so the resources that you would
need to spend to produce a longer chain
to convince someone that you didn't
spend that coin in the other chain which
is now the one that would have included
the previous spend is to find these hash
values quicker than the network can the
incentives are set up in such a way to
make it unlikely that someone want to do
that since if you do find the next hash
value in the chain well you can create a
new block
which is worth 50 bitcoins if you create
a longer chain trying to catch up to the
chain that the network has well that's
going to require a lot more computing
resources and would only allow you to
respond the bitcoins that you already
owned so this doesn't provide anonymity
in the traditional sense it avoids the
need for a central authority but each
transaction is known to everyone in the
network the way to provide some
anonymity is instead of using your
actual names in the transactions you can
have different identities for each
transaction so this is going to be some
new identity it will still need to have
a certificate that validates the public
key for that but it doesn't need to be
tied to Alice's identity in any way
that's visible to anyone else so that's
the way to provide some anonymity even
though all the transactions in the
network are public to everyone who
participates so this actually works
there's at least a reasonable number of
people that trust this currency and are
providing computation to create these
blocks which is incentivized by creating
the value of new bitcoins there's about
9 million bitcoins currently available
and the marketplace fluctuates and it
depends on the cost of computation as
well as the trust in the Bitcoin network
there have been some incidents where the
that there have been some incidents
where the price fluctuated wildly
because there was some concern about the
security of the Bitcoin transaction site
but the current market is fairly stable
around $5 for a Bitcoin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
