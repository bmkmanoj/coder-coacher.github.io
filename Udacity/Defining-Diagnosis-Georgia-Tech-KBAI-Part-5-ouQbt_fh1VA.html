determining what is wrong with a
malfunctioning device or more generally
what is the fault that is responsible
for a malfunctioning system given a
system we expect some behavior from it
we expect you to do something however we
may observe that the system is doing
something different so there is the
expected behavior and it is the observed
behavior and it is a discrepancy between
them when there is a discrepancy we know
that the system is malfunctioning the
question then becomes what is the fault
or the set of false responsible for that
malfunctioning system when we think of
diagnosis we typically think of medical
diagnosis but of course diagnosis can
occur in a very large number of domains
here are three diagnostic domains with
which all of us are familiar the first
figure shows the engine of a car when I
insert the key into the ignition system
I expect the engine to turn on that is
the expected behavior but suppose that
insert the key and engine doesn't turn
on that's the observed behavior there is
a discrepancy between the expected
behavior and the observed behavior when
inserted key into the ignition I expect
the engine to turn on that's the
expected behavior but let us suppose
that I put the key in an Indian doesn't
turn on that's the observed behavior
there is a discrepancy between the
expected behavior turning the engine on
and the absurd behavior the engine
doesn't turn on so I know there is a
malfunction given the small function the
question becomes what is the fault of
false responsible for it and that's a
diagnostic task to address this
diagnostic task I may use a rule which
says that if the engine doesn't turn on
when the key is inserted check the
carburetor suppose I go and check the
carburetor and everything is okay with
the carburetor then another rule may get
activated and that may say if the engine
doesn't turn on and everything is okay
with the carburetor go check the spark
plugs and this way I'm a user production
system to isolate default or false
responsible for the malfunction
something similar happens with computer
hardware repair when we turn on a
computer there are a few behaviors that
we expect of it we expected to boot up
quickly we expected to run fast and we
expect it to stay cool now imagine if we
turn on a computer and notice it started
to run a much higher temperature than
we're accustomed to we might remember
the
last time we encountered this problem
the problems with the fan so we might
use that to then diagnose this as a
problem with the fan and replace the fan
this happens at the software level 2 if
I'm writing a program and the output
differs from what I'm expecting I said
about debugging the program and finding
the fault one way of doing that is
called rubber duck debugging which
involves explaining my model of how my
program works to the rubber duck so that
I might uncover the error by forcing
myself through an explanation process
note that we discussed the same
diagnostic task in three different
domains in each domain there was a
discrepancy between the expected and
observed behaviors and we try to
identify the fault or false responsible
for it but also that we alluded to three
different methods for doing diagnosis
the method of rule-based reasoning the
matter of case-based reasoning and the
method of model-based reasoning we
haven't talked a lot about the method of
model based reasoning so far we will do
so when we come to systems thinking
later in the class of course we can use
the method of rule base engine not only
for diagnosing car engines but also for
repairing computer hardware offer
diagnosing computer software and this
particular lesson of a focus will be on
the diagnostic task by now all of us
already familiar with many reasoning
methods that are potentially applicable
to the task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
