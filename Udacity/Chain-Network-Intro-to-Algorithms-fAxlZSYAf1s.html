structure that we're talking about
mostly in this course are graphs also
sometimes called networks which is
structure discrete structure consisting
of a set of nodes sometimes called
vertices and edges sometimes called
links and interestingly usually the
people who call the nodes nodes call the
edges links and the people who call the
nodes vertices call the edges edges
because these both come from geometry
but for whatever reason I mix them
together I apologize I tried to change
it just didn't work here's an example of
a graph that has six nodes the blue
circles here and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
edges connecting those nodes together in
these kinds of graphs the edges just
link up two of the nodes not more than
two not fewer than two then what we're
going to be talking about that edges
don't have any direction to them they
just link them together the particular
positioning of them on the page is
really irrelevant what matters is which
nodes are connected to which other nodes
so we're going to be talking about for
the next little while
our special networks that have
particular structures and that usually
fall into different families so one
particular family of networks is called
the chain networks k network consists of
a set of nodes and a sequence of edges
between them that basically connect them
into a single chain so this is an
example of a chain Network with five
nodes 1 2 3 4 5 and 4 edges 1 2 3 4
connecting them together and there's
essentially only one such network right
we can imagine flipping it around or
relabeling the nodes but topologically
there really is only one way of
connecting five nodes into a chain now I
mentioned that this is part of a family
of networks and you get a different
chain network for each different
possible number of nodes so now a
question that I'd like to have you
answer is how many edges do you have in
a network that has n nodes if it's a
chain Network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
