take a look at a critical weakness of
ipv4 in ipv4 there's no authentication
of the source IP address that is if
Alice receives a packet with Bob source
IP address Alice cannot be sure that the
packet is really from Bob as a result IP
spoofing or forging the source IP
address is a commonly used technique in
cyber attacks for example parts in a
botnet can send a DNS query to DNS
servers asking a full txt record of a
domain by spoofing the source IP edges
of a victim website as a result the
response from the DNS servers which can
amount to a very large volume of data is
sent to the victim website and this
would result in a denial service at the
victim web site IPSec provides security
measures at the IP layer these include
authentication of source IP addresses
come the reality and integrity
protection of packet data and
authenticity of packet data in
particular preventing replay of packets
of course a network application or
protocol can implement its own specific
security mechanisms to achieve these
goals by having IPSec that is by
implementing security at the IP layer we
can ensure secure networking not only
for applications that have security
mechanisms but also for many
applications that are imminent about
security because all applications run on
top of the IP layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
