example of these two stories and see how
the analysis that we have done this
semantic analysis can help disambiguate
between you two different meanings or
kill here so first my background
knowledge tells me that kill can have
several meanings just like cake had
several meetings earlier till can have
the meaning of causing the death of
someone or kill can have a meaning of to
put an end to something there could be
other meanings of kill as well second my
background knowledge tells me that when
kill has the meaning of to cause the
death of someone then they typically is
a victim as well as an agent in this
particular case the victim is twenty
five people and the agent is a serious
earthquake my background knowledge also
tells me then with the meaning of
killers to put an end to something then
typically there is both an agent that
puts an end to something and an object
that gets put an end to in this
particular case twenty five proposals is
the object in the agent is president of
Lois Robbo via it is this combination of
background knowledge that allows me to
infer the meaning of kill and the first
sentence says to cause the death of
someone and the kill and the second
sentence s to put an end to something I
hope you can appreciate the power and
beauty of this theory but it is also
important to point out there is thirty
as many limitations to understand some
of the limitations of this theory let's
go back to the sentence I took the candy
from the baby in this sentence we are
inferred that took signifies stealing
the candy for the baby
in effect we had a large number of rules
that told us how to make sense of the
word take by making sense of the word
candy making sense of the word from but
as we look at increasingly large number
of forms of the sentence the number of
rules that we need starts exploding so
consider small variations of the
sentence I took the candy for the baby
I cooked it toy from the baby I took the
medicine from the baby I took this smile
from the baby
I took a smile for the baby they are all
valid english-language sentences and
each one of them tells the story as I
look at more and more variations of this
sentence I'll need to find more and more
rules that can disambiguate between
different interpretations or take in
those variations of sentence
in practice it turns out that it's very
hard to enumerate all the rules for all
the variations of sentences like this
one nevertheless the story appears to
cover a good percentage of stories that
we routinely deal with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
