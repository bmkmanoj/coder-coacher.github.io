for two to the fourth I know that's two
times two times two times two I have
repeated multiplication four times so I
get 16 that's definitely not 18 43 to
the six I have 3 times 3 times 3 times 3
times 3 times 3 which is really 9 x 9 x
9 or 729 that's definitely not 18 6 to
the third is 6 times 6 times 6 so I get
to 16 here i just have 9 squared so nine
times nine i have the repeated
multiplication of nine well that makes
8181 isn't 18 even though they both have
digits of eight and one for this last
one I just have one 18 times that's a
lot of ones but I know one x 1 x 1 x 1
is always just going to be 1 so this
answer is going to equal one so that's
not it either this is why it's just
important to think about what an
exponent means most of the math you do
on a daily basis involves multiplication
that's why it's so easy to think about
exponents as multiplication we have to
slow down and remind ourselves that 2 to
the 4th isn't really 8 it's really 16
just like 9 squared is really 81</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
