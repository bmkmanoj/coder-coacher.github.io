aware that our memories are malleable
and they've developed techniques when
investigating crimes or accidents to
help diminish the possibility of false
memories one thing they do is to
separate witnesses immediately so they
cannot talk to each other this way what
one person remembers from an accident is
not contaminated by what another person
remembers from an accident another thing
they can do is to be careful with the
types of words they use to ask questions
for example Elizabeth Loftus examined
how the types of words that people use
to ask questions can influence our
memory of an event for example in one
study participants were assigned to
different groups participants saw slides
of pictures of cars that collided and
they were asked to estimate how fast the
vehicles were going but they were asked
in different ways there were five
conditions the participants were asked
to describe the car accident as if they
were an eyewitness participants were
asked how fast the car was going when
they hit each other
smashed each other bumped each other
collided with each other or contacted
each other depending on which group they
were in they heard a different ending of
the sentence a week after this
participants were asked if they saw any
broken glass in the pictures on the
slides participants in the smashed
condition reported the highest speeds
after that came collided then bumped
then hit didn't contact it and when they
were asked about the glass participants
in the smashed condition were more
likely to say yes they saw a glass in
the pictures so here we see the type of
question or the type of word that's used
to describe the accident influences the
person's memory of the event and may
actually modify the person's memory
again this experiment demonstrates how
easily our memories can be changed our
memories can be easily distorted by the
type of question and information that
comes after an event and this can cause
inaccurate recall or reconstructive
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
