URL so we found this position that's
going to be the value of start
underscore link now our goal is to
extract this URL and the URL starts from
the first double quote that we find
after start link and it ends with the
second double quote so for the last quiz
of this unit your goal is to write all
the code we need to end up finding that
URL so this is gonna be the hardest quiz
that we've had so far it's going to
involve you thinking about variables
thinking about how to use find in
different ways and write several lines
of code yourself think carefully about
how to do this but I think if you
understand what we've covered so far
you'll be able to do this yourself
so to be specific here's the quiz your
goal is to write Python code that
assigns to the variable URL these are
all lowercase letters a string that is
the value of the first URL found on the
page in a link tag so you should assume
that we have the variable page that's
already initialized to the contents of
the page and in your browser this will
be initialized to the contents of an
example page from the previous quiz we
also have the value of start link
already worked out it said start link is
the result of calling find on page
passing in the string a href equals and
your goal is to finish this code so at
the end of this code the value of URL is
the first link on the page and if you
print the value of URL and you've done
all the code correctly for the example
that we've provided you should get the
result HTTP colon slash slash
udacity.com which is the URL that finds
the Udacity web page so this is a pretty
tough quiz there's a lot of steps think
about it carefully so it uses almost
everything that you've seen in the unit
today you'll have to think about how to
use the fine method possibly passing in
numbers as well as strings as well as
variables to keep track of things to
find the result you'll also need to
think about how to use the string
indexing operators to select a
subsequence of a string</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
