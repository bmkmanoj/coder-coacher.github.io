less than or equal to X and X is less
than 6 is choice C this is the one that
we already talked about you know that
the area shared by the two inequalities
here is the one that needs to be shaded
in which is just this area now let's try
an or negative 2 is less than X or X is
less than 6 this is definitely tricky
the way that I like to try to graph
these is to start by putting the proper
parentheses or brackets at the proper
places and facing the proper direction
so first we have negative 2 is less than
or equal to X I come down to negative 2
I know this needs to be a square bracket
because of the less than or equal to I
know that values of X are going to lie
to the right of negative 2 and including
negative 2 so I put a square bracket
facing to the right now we have this or
X is less than 6 so I come over to 6 and
I put a round bracket facing to the left
since X is less than 6 now or means that
all acceptable values of X will either
fulfill this criteria or this criteria
so that means there they'll either be in
this range anything greater than equal
to 2 or they're either be in this range
and of course anything in the middle is
fine too
so this is the entire number line shaded
in that's choice a probably not we would
have expected when we just looked at
this you can see what a huge difference
there is and we switched from an 2 or
negative 2 is less than or equal to X
and X is greater than 6 start with a
square bracket pointing to the right at
negative 2 and this area needs to
overlap with some area that's graphed by
the X is greater than 6 line we know
that if we graph this first inequality
it's going to be everything greater than
equal to negative 2 and the second
inequality is going to share everything
that's shaded by that line that's
greater than 6 so the only thing we
actually need to shade is this section
the greater than 6 part so that's choice
D and finally our last one well we know
the answer must be B because that's the
only one that's left
but let's graph it anyway negative 2 is
less than or equal to X so as before
square bracket at negative 2 pointing to
the right or X is greater than 6 so that
gives us this that means that we need
all of these values that are greater
than equal to 2 to be filled in because
we need to include all the values that
fit either of these things everything
that's greater than 6 is also greater
than or equal to negative 2 so the
number line for this looks
exactly like the number line for this
inequality alone we'll look that's twice
