the following given two lines in two
dimensions where do they intersect first
let's make a definition two lines are
parallel if their normal vectors are
parallel so for example these lines are
parallel because they're normal vectors
differ by a factor of negative two
whereas these two lines are not parallel
because they're normal vectors are not
parallel it may seem strange that we are
using normal vectors in our definition
instead of direction vectors in two
dimensions the definitions are
equivalent however in higher dimensions
there will not be a single direction
vector so using the normal vector will
be more extensible later on if two lines
are not parallel then they will have an
intersection at a single point
however if two lines are parallel then
there are two possibilities they might
not intersect at all or they might turn
out to be the same line so-called
coincident lines in which case they will
intersect in infinitely many points in
linear algebra this trichotomy of cases
for intersections is the rule when asked
whether two linear objects intersect the
answer is that there will either be a
unique point of intersection there will
be no common intersection or there will
be infinitely many intersection points
there cannot just be two or three
intersections so given two lines in two
dimensions how can we tell whether they
have an intersection
well first we should check whether they
are parallel by looking at their normal
vectors if their normal vectors are
parallel then we need to check whether
they are the same line how can we do
this suppose the two lines are
coincident that is the same line then if
I take any point from the first line and
any point from the second line in
reality from the same line then the
vector connecting the two points will be
parallel to both lines in other words
this vector will be orthogonal to both
lines normal vectors on the other hand
suppose the two lines are not coincident
but still parallel then these lines have
no common intersections so if we pick a
point from the first
line and a point from the second line
then the vector connecting the two
points won't be in the direction of the
lines in other words this connecting
vector won't be orthogonal to either of
the normal vectors this gives us a
computable test for whether two lines
are the same once we know that they're
parallel two parallel lines are
coincident or equal if and only if the
vector connecting some pair of points
one from each line is orthogonal to both
the lines normal vectors okay
now let's suppose we have two non
parallel lines so we know they will
intersect how do we find their
intersection point let's write the lines
in their standard forms ax plus B y
equals k1 and CX plus dy equals k2 I
write this left curly brace to indicate
that this is a system of simultaneous
linear equations so how do we go about
solving the system it would be nice
to divide the first equation through by
a so that we can solve for x however
what if a equals zero well if that were
the case we could move to the other
equation and then try dividing this
second equation through by C but what if
C is also zero actually that can't
happen because if a and C are both zero
then the lines are just of the form y
equals k1 over B and y equals k2 over D
which are both horizontal lines but
since we assume the two lines were not
parallel they both can't be horizontal
so that means either a or C has to be
nonzero to make matters simpler let's
just do the following at the beginning
of the whole procedure we check to make
sure a does not equal zero if so then we
swap the order of the two equations so a
and C would swap places B and D swap
places and k1 and k2 also swap then we
can always assume that a does not equal
zero so with that assumption that a is
not zero we can go ahead and divide
through by a giving us X plus B over a y
equals k1 over a now instead of
solving for x directly i'm going to do
something slightly different
I will now subtract C times the
left-hand side of this equation from the
second equation to maintain the balance
of the second equation
I'll also subtract C times k1
over a from the right-hand side of the
second equation so now our second
equation looks like CX plus dy minus CX
minus BC over a y equals negative C K 1
over a plus K to the C terms cancel and
after collecting the Y terms together we
get quantity D minus BC over a times y
equals negative CK 1 over a plus K 2 now
let's multiply through by a to make the
equation a bit nicer to work with and
then to solve for y we can divide
through by ad minus BC or can we
what if ad minus BC equals 0 well if
this is the case then let's rewrite the
left-hand side as a dot product using
the trick we used before this gives us
the vector a B dotted with the vector D
minus C equals 0 now this first vector
is a normal vector to the first line and
the second vector D minus C is parallel
to the second line looking at this
geometrically this means that the line
ax plus B y equals K 1 is parallel to
the line in the direction of D minus C
which is CX plus dy equals K 2 but this
violates our initial assumption that the
lines were not parallel so ad minus BC
cannot equal 0
under this assumption great so that
means we can divide through by ad minus
BC so y equals negative C k1 plus a k2
over the quantity ad minus BC now let's
use the same subtraction process to go
from this equation back to our first
equation if we subtract B over a times y
from the left-hand side then we can
subtract B over a times
all of this from the right hand side
this gives us the messy looking equation
x equals K 1 over a minus B over a times
quantity minus CK 1 plus a K 2 over
quantity ad minus BC let's pull out a
factor of 1 over a to make it a bit
cleaner and then forming a common
denominator for the K 1 term allows us
to consolidate the fraction inside the
parenthesis this lets us kill the BC K 1
terms and then cancel the factors of a
to get this final form x equals d K 1
minus BK 2 all over ad minus BC so the
point of intersection of these two lines
ax plus B y equals K 1 and CX plus dy
equals K 2 assuming they're not parallel
lines is this point x equals D K 1 minus
BK 2 over ad minus BC and y equals
negative C K 1 plus K 2 over ad minus BC
this formula might look rather messy at
first blush but it actually exhibits
some nice symmetries that we'll explore
a bit later for now though let's go
ahead and code up a function to compute
this intersection between two lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
