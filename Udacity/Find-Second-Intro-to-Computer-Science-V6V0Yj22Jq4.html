have been quite simple only needed a
line or maybe two of code to finish them
now we're gonna try a quiz which is
gonna be much more challenging and I'm
gonna give it a gold star to show that
this is especially challenging quiz so
if you can get this one on your own
you're really understanding things very
well if you get stuck on this one
that's okay there'll be some hints to
make it a little easier and then
hopefully you'll understand the answer
after you see it and you'll have a lot
more chances especially on the homework
to try some harder questions on your own
so here's the question your goal is to
define a procedure and we'll call this
one find second and it takes two strings
as its inputs so the first input is the
search string the second input is the
target string and your goal is to print
out the position of the second
occurrence of the target string in the
search string so it should output a
number that's the position of the second
occurrence of the target string in the
search string so I'll show you an
example in the Python interpreter of
what finds second should do and then you
should try to solve this on your own so
for an example here's the quote we had
in unit 1 from George Danton and if we
evaluate find second passing in Danton
is the first input and audace as the
second what we should get is the
position of the second occurrence of
audace in the input string Danton and
when we run this we see that we get 25
which is that position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
