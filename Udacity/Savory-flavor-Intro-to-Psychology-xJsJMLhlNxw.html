describe this for us please that's a
great question Lauren I'm glad you asked
this flavor is actually called umami
which means Pleasant savory taste you'll
find the tsunami taste in things such as
age meats and cheeses it's a very
difficult flavor to describe but it's
also found in msg or monosodium
glutamate which is a flavouring so
savory is really a combined sense of
both msg as well as the perceived savory
odors by our nose interesting so what's
expected of our since leads after
they're presented with this sample well
our senses will be presented with five
samples in each of these will have a
very light version of the flavor then
they'll have to correspond and taste
each one and correctly identify the
basic flavor now do we have a projected
winner for this event well Lauren i'm
not sure what the stats are for these
sent sleights so we'll just have to wait
actually Susan if you don't mind I can
interject here I was speaking to
essentially earlier named Alex who I
suspect may win why is that well Laurent
stick out your tongue okay exactly nope
do you want to feel the surface for me
can you feel tiny little bumps yeah now
those bumps are actually clusters of
taste buds and we call these clusters
papilla yeah that's the thing it is you
can actually stick your tongue back
inside now yeah so anyways humans on
average have about 10,000 taste buds
Alex with 10,000 plus another extra
thousand eleven thousand taste buds just
may take home the golden brain today
that's interesting any well I'm actually
getting worried that our since Lee it's
are ready to begin so back to you Susan
with coverage of the event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
