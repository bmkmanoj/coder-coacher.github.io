to look at our event connectors these
are all these are also very common in
fact in the garland and Shaw book on the
resource page they devote a very nice
section to describing all the different
variations that might exist with event
connectors
first of all event connectors are
responsible for a flow of control so
that's a coordination role they may also
pass parameters typically this might
involve timestamps or actual data so
that's a communication roll event
connectors once an event is detected
generate messages method calls after
detecting the event or some combination
of events that it's prepared to detect
event connectors are particularly
relevant for distributed asynchronous
applications in which we need to know
when certain things happen the set of
event connectors that exists is dynamic
that is the application itself can turn
on or turn off the ability to detect
certain events some of the variations
that might exist among implementations
of event connectors include
cardinalities that is how many different
components can produce the event how
many different observers of the event
might exist and might there be patterns
of events in which we'd like to be able
to detect occurrence of the pattern how
are the events actually communicated is
it via best effort exactly once at most
once at least once do we have a priority
among a set of events do we always
handle the outgoing ones before the
incoming ones are there different
priorities embedded with the event that
are handled in a certain fashion
synchronous asynchronous or based upon a
certain timeout
how is notification handle is it polled
that is does the potential receivers
have to periodically look to see whether
the event occurred is there a publish or
publish subscribe interface in which a
particular component registers its
interest in events and then gets told
when events happen is there a central
updating mechanism that
or registry that receives all the events
and distributes them to the known known
parties or is are their cues sitting
there that everybody is responsible for
looking at causality refers to the
circumstances determining the actual
issuing of the events are their
absolutely absolute event occurrences or
could it could the events be relative to
other situations that is conditional
type events and what's the ultimate
generator of the event might have come
from hardware such as paid page faults
interrupts or traps or they software
signals or triggers or even inputs from
the from the GUI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
