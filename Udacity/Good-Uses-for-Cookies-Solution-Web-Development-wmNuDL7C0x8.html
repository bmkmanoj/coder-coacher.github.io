subjective quiz but here are the answers
I was looking for storing logging
information this is something you know I
just mentioned previously that's a
really common use of cookies so when you
log into a web site the web server gives
you a cookie and that identifies you for
future requests storing small amounts of
data to avoid hitting a database yes
this is another kind of handy little
thing you know if you've just got a
small piece of data that you want to
store you know it's it's temporary its
small you don't need to have all the
infrastructure of a database to store it
and have to you know hit your database
on every request to retrieve it that
sort of thing especially if it's it's if
it's you know anonymous data you know
data you don't mind losing because a
user can of course clear all the cookies
out of their browser or you know a
browser may not have cookies enabled at
all storing user preference info no this
is not a good use of cookies at least in
the notion of a user as we've been kind
of talking about work you know you might
log into a website you have these
preferences this is because you want the
data to survive you know cookies can be
erased at any time a user can change
browsers they can go to a different
machine and the cookies don't you know
the cookies are specific to one browser
and as long as the user allows them to
be there so data like user preferences
that you want to exist you know until a
user changes it on your website
shouldn't be storing cookies and
tracking you for ads this is
unfortunately maybe not a a good use
more of an appropriate use because
tracking you for ads isn't really
inherently a good thing but it's a
really common use of cookies you you go
to a website you may find yourself with
20 cookies that are tracking you for
different ad providers and in fact I had
a friend who worked for an ad tracking
company for a while and and and and
these two answers are kind of related
they used to joke that they had the
world's largest database stored in users
browsers you know all across the
Internet they had like many hundreds and
thousands of terabytes of data in theory
stored you know a few hundred bytes at a
time and users cookies because they
powered a lot of really big ad networks
cookies and we'll come back to a little
bit how ad networks works I think it's
it's interesting to understand
cookies are critical technology for
tracking youth for advertising purposes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
