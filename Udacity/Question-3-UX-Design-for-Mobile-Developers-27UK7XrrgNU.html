this idea that it makes sense to start a
product by thinking at a high level and
not delving into details too soon
now you're going to apply that idea to
something you've actually built before
and the way you do that is first you'll
identify a product this doesn't
necessarily have to be a mobile app or
even an app at all it should just be
some product that you've worked on in
the past once you've decided on that
you'll think about what the intended UX
was and I'm using this word intended
even though there's definitely a chance
you may not have explicitly thought
about user experience you probably had
some implicit understanding of what you
wanted this app or this product to feel
like using next you'll make a Prezi
wireframe to help you focus on the
high-level flow of this product and then
you'll find opportunities for high-level
improvements this can mean rearranging
the steps adding a step removing a step
but hopefully by forcing yourself to
write down the flow of the product at a
high level kind of like this you'll spot
any opportunities for big-picture
improvements good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
