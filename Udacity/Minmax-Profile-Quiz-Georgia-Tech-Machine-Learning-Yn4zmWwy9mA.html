going to need to understand the folk
theorem is the notion of a min/max
profile so a min/max profile is going to
be a pair of payoffs one for each player
and the value for player represents the
payoffs that that player can achieve by
defending itself from a malicious
adversary so what do you suppose a
malicious adversary would mean in a game
theory context someone who's desperately
trying to hurt you and what does hurt
mean gives you the lowest score yeah and
what does that remind you of from your
lesson my grad students do you think
they're malicious they would explain a
few things
yeah I don't think they're malicious
they're sweet yeah I know a lot of them
and they're they're wonderful people
mmm well it what it reminds me of is
they are wonderful people it reminds me
of zero-sum games exactly so you can
imagine thinking about the game that
we're playing no longer as being I get
my pay off and you get yours but I get
my pay off and you get the negative of
my payoff so you oh you don't really
care about yourself anymore all you care
about is hurting me and that's that's
the idea of a malicious adversary that's
what makes girlfriends like that I'm
sorry oh it is people do get into this
mode sometimes and that and that's
actually going to be important in
understanding the folk theorem so what
I'd like to do is figure out what the
min-max profile is for this game so this
is a very famous game theory game
example sometimes goes by the name
battle of the sexes that would the B and
the S stand for sometimes it stands for
Bach and Stravinsky yeah those are like
composers I think you mean like the
Backstreet Boys and sting ah all right
that works for me so so let me explain
this story it turns out that smooth and
curly actually got away they didn't make
any kind of deal they actually just
figured out a way of escaping from the
jail so there they're back out on the
streets again mm-hmm and they decided
that they'd like to celebrate their
freedom by going out to see a concert
and they both decided that in advance
but what they didn't know is which
concerts were available once they
escaped out into the world and couldn't
communicate with each other they
discovered that there's in fact two
concerts in the city that night the
Backstreet Boys are playing and sting is
playing okay now as it turns out each of
them is now going to have to choose
whether to go to the concert with the
Backstreet Boys or sting and they're
choosing independently now if they end
up going to different concerts they're
both going to be unhappy and get zeroes
if they end up at the same concert then
they're going to be happier but in fact
as it turns out smooth really likes the
Backstreet Boys and would prefer that
they both end up at the Backstreet Boy
concert but curly really liked sting and
would prefer that they end up at the
sting concert that's not realistic which
part the fact that I prefer the
Backstreet Boys to sting what do you
mean you I mean this is smooth he's a
criminal
hmm that's a fine point that you make
there there is no connection between
these characters and ourselves of
real-life characters Living Dead or
fictional or mathematical or
instructional if so otherwise purely
coincidental
yeah I could switch these around if
you'd prefer no no I'll go with your
fantasy all right I think yeah I think
that payoff matrix might actually look
something like we both have twos in the
in the same place but anyway but let's
say for the purposes of this example
there's a little bit of a disagreement
okay so now what we need to figure out
is what the min-max profile is for this
game okay all right so that's gonna be a
pair of numbers mm-hmm
one number corresponds to the payoff for
curly and one number of corresponds to
payoff for smooth and it should be the
payoff for curly should be the payoff
that curly can guarantee himself even if
smooth is trying to get him to have a
low score okay and vice-versa smooth
score is going to be the score that it
can guarantee he can guarantee himself
even if curly is trying to minimize
Smoove score all right so let's do this
as a quiz so I want you to find the
min-max profile for this game this box
Stravinsky game or a backstreet sting
game and put the number for curly in the
first box and Smoove in the second box
okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
