in detail a very well known form of a
camera a single lens reflex camera this
is an example of one I has a lens and
the whole body I'm going to take the
lens off and it basically not can see
more details of this camera will look at
it much more in detail in a few seconds
but you basically see that there are
certain aspects of this camera there's a
viewfinder and there there is a mirror
which moves away we'll see examples of
that a lot and of course this is where
the shutter releases so this is a
standard film camera here I want you to
also show you this most of your concern
that I've exposed film this was an
exposed to him already we will be
looking at more detail what film like
this looks like but this is again you
know one of the more widely used form
factors for professional photography so
here I'm showing you now a cut out of
the same camera or a similar camera here
you can see all of the details that we
looked at this is where the viewfinder
was the focus or zoom ring are in the
lens and I took this out before I showed
you any of the stuff were right here the
shutter release button is right there
this is the one that when you press
opens the mechanism so let the light in
to where the film would be the lenses
are all in the mechanisms right here
there is a diaphragm and we'll talk
about the diaphragm and all of that
kinds of stuff because that's where all
of the openings are controlled between
these lenses to allow the right kinds of
light into the camera and of course this
was a film camera so there is where the
film is in new modern digital cameras of
course the film has been replaced by a
ccd sensor or CMOS sensor again
something we will be looking at in much
more detail later and all of the
focal-plane shutters are all mechanisms
that are built in here that actually
luck again different types of things
happen in terms of how the focal planes
and everything else is adjusted to get
the right kinds of light into the where
the film is now of course you noticed
and I showed you the things there was a
glass here basically single lens reflex
this thing opens to allow you to get the
light incorrectly and this is the
prismatic sensor that
it's the light into the viewfinder so
the viewfinder can see exactly what the
lens is seeing and as soon as the
shutter is released the mirror moves up
and then the light basically goes and
hits the film so you actually get to see
exactly what you're seeing will be the
one the image that will be registered
and actually then imaged on the sensor
or the film</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
