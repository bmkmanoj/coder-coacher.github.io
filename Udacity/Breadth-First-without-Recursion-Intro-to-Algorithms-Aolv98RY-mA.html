breadth-first search but we're gonna do
it really easily at least for the people
version by grabbing the first element
off the open list instead of the last
element off the open list and let's take
a look at how that changes things all
right so we start off with D as the
first thing added to the list and D on
the open list and now what we do is well
the first and the last element are the
same so nothing changed yet so we grab D
off we mark any unmarked neighbors of
that node of D which in this case are E
and C just as before and that's done for
this time through and now we go back up
to the top and things get a little
different this time
well actually not that different the
order was sort of arbitrary and so first
and last are sort of arbitrary but we're
gonna grab the first thing off the list
just like the instructions say and
that's e add its neighbors in the
neighbors get they still get added to
the end of the list so that's a little
different in terms of the numbering so
far but now is where it gets even
different or we go back up to the top
and we grab the first element off the
list which in this case is C so we
alternated it instead of continuing in
one direction we're actually expanding
outward from D we did D and then C and E
and then B and F and now what happens
next is we expand from F we've expanded
G added it to the end of the list but
now before we touch G we're always
pulling off the front of the list now we
get to B alright now we visited
everything the next thing we pull off is
G we notice it has no open neighbors
then we pull off a we notice that it has
no open neighbors and the open list is
empty the search has finished and you
can see what happened in this case is we
expand it out from D and now a and G
well the sum of those a and G are 13
instead of 12 which is not a really
significant or meaningful difference at
this point but it is indicating that the
search is proceeding differently and the
way it's proceeding importantly is out
from the center all the paths that it
found all the edges that it expanded it
new shortest distance it was away from
the beginning state so this is going to
give us what we need to actually find
shortest paths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
