you to do is make a sign-up page that
validates the users input but should ask
for four things a name a password verify
the password and an email address which
will be optional if the user submits
something that's invalid it should print
out an error message and if it's and if
it is valid it should redirect to a
welcome page I'll give you a demo of
this now so here's my signup page it's
running at this URL and if I were to
type in a valid username and passwords
and an email and click Submit watch the
URL we get redirected to welcome
username equal space where it prints out
welcome space now a couple things that
this should do if you don't enter a
username and you submit we should get an
error message likewise if we don't enter
a password you should get an error
message if we submit an invalid username
this one's invalid because it has a
space in it and I'll include in the
notes what a valid username is we should
still get an error message and if I
include two passwords that do not match
I'll also get an error message now
notice that when we included an invalid
username we kept the username in the
forum but when we included an invalid
password we blanked the passwords that
is that is intentional the email address
is optional so I can type in to matching
passwords I can make this a valid
username and when I submit this form it
says welcome okay all as well if I type
in an invalid email address and I'll
include for you what makes an email
address valid for our purposes we should
get an error message on that field as
well that's not a valid email be sure to
read the notes and when you've got this
all working please enter the URL here
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
