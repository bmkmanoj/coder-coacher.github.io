implementing a parallel algorithm for
tone mapping tone mapping is the process
of mapping an image with a wide range of
brightness values into an image with a
narrow range of brightness values this
is an important operation because the
real world has an enormous range of
different brightness values for example
think of this spectrum as the range of
brightness values in the real world on
one end of the spectrum we have a bright
sunny day on the other hand of the
spectrum we have a very dark moonlit
tonight and it turns out that the bright
sunny day is about million times
brighter than the night unfortunately
hours computer screen can only display a
narrow range of brightness values and
think of this spectrum as the range of
brightness values that our computer
screens can display sotto mapping is the
problem of taking the brightness values
that we've seen in the real world and
mapping them down into a tiny range of
brightness values that we can display on
our computer screens and this process is
toe mapping and there's a good chance
that the camera on your cell phone has a
high dynamic range or HDR mode when you
take pictures in HDR mode then your
camera is performing a tone mapping step
to arrive at the final image that shows
you in this problem so you will be
implementing a simple algorithm for tone
mapping whole histogram equalization and
this factors nicely into parallel map
reduce scatter and scan operations you
have been exposed to the map operation
in previous homework so in this homework
you will focus on reduce scatter and
scan recall that histogram counts the
number of occurrences of something in
the data set for example if we measure
the heights of everyone taking this
class and compute a histogram of the
heights that may look something like
this the height of each bar in this
histogram is a count of how many
people's high fall into a particular
range so for example this bar may
represent the range of people whose
height is from 170 centimeters to
hundred and eighty centimeters and this
bar right here me represent people whose
height is from 200 centimeters to 210
centimeter and these people are really
tall by the way the main idea in this
homework is to first compute a histogram
of the brightness values in the image
and after that when we'll compute a scan
of the histogram that one computed in
step one using the plus operator and it
turns out that the array resulting from
the scan tells us exactly how to remap
the brightness values in the original
image and this is just one of the many
really interesting applications to scan
and that is why we are going to focus on
skin in this particular problem set in
order to figure out the range of
brightness values that should go into
each column of the histogram you will
need to first compute the minimum
brightness in the image and second
compute the maximum brightness in the
image we will provide you with an array
of brightness values but you will need
to figure out the minimum and the
maximum values using the parallel reduce
operation when computing a histogram in
parallel it is very likely that
different threads will try and update
the same memory locations at the same
time and to correctly handle this
parallel data scattering requires
special care for now we recommend that
you use the atomic add function when
computing your histogram although using
an atomic add may be a little slow but
it will ensure that multiple threads
don't try and update the same memory
locations on currently and in turn that
will ensure the correctness of your
histogram computation once you get
everything working feel free to start
experimenting and see if you can avoid
using the time you add and if you're
interested we have included a more
detailed mathematical formulation of the
histogram equalization in the instructor
conference lastly I would like to thank
