exponent patterns here are some
expressions and here are those same
expressions expanded based on the
exponents I have three threes multiplied
together and three twos multiplied
together because the exponents were
three and two the same is true down here
I have two twos and three 5s if I wanted
to simplify these expressions I would
write the final answer with one base and
the exponent for example for this case I
would have 3/5 so I could write this
answer as 3 to the fifth the second
one's a little bit tricky I have a base
of 2 and a base of five the bases are
different so I can't combine these two
bases and write them with an exponent I
have to keep them separate I still have
two twos and three fives when we
simplify expressions with exponents we
want to try and combine the exponents
that have the same base so think about
what I did here what did I really do
with these exponents to get this answer
and what do we have to do in this case
and I know it seems weird that we have
an answer that's the original question
but sometimes that happens sometimes we
can't combine the powers we could of
course multiply each of these out to get
a number but I wasn't focused on the
number I wanted to look at the exponents
and what we were doing with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
