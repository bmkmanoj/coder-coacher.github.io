surrounded by double quotes or the like
are a tricky issue that comes up in both
javascript and HTML let's bring all of
our regular expression power to bear to
see about separating quoted strings from
other words here I've drawn an evil
quoted string that contains a bunch of
double quotes we really want to get to
just the heart of it just the contents
and peel off these two double quotes at
the end they're like the rind I want to
get to the core however if I just
repeatedly use string dot fine to look
for double quotes I'll find this one but
also this one in the middle this one in
the middle and this one in the end so I
might mistakenly think that it's too
quoted strings I said and nothing over
here
oh no find isn't good enough in a
shocking twist we'll have to use regular
expressions instead but first to make
our job a little easier
let me introduce to you some new regular
expressions the first is the dot or
period which matches any character
except a new line or what you get when
you press Enter or return
for example here I'm looking for any
decimal digit 0 through 9 and then any
character anything except a line break
and then another 0 through 9 so for
example this is a decimal digit this is
another decimal digit and the a between
them is any character
this too is a decimal digit the two
between them is any character and this
too is another decimal digit this cc3
doesn't qualify because this C is not in
zero through nine and one more sometimes
it's nice to be able to say anything
except a digit or anything except a
number or anything except P here we're
looking for 0 through 9 followed by
anything that's not a and also not B so
here
oh that immediately didn't work because
the next thing was an A and we're asking
for not a would over here we've got a 1
and a space and space isn't a or b so
that looks good then here we've got a 2
and a 2 and this second 2 is not a or b
so that looks good and here we've got a
2 in a space and this space is not a or
b so that looks good C is not 0 through
9 C is not 0 through 9
three is zero for nine but then we're at
the end of the string so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
