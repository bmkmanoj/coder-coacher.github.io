want you to keep in mind that a promise
is a try-catch wrapper around code that
will finish at an unpredictable time
here let me show you an example promise
is a constructor
you can either store a promise as a
variable like I'm doing right here or
you can simply work on it as soon as you
create it either way works just fine but
you'll often see me simply work on the
promise without storing it as a variable
you pass a function to the promise with
two arguments resolve and reject resolve
and reject are two callbacks that you
use to specify when a promise has either
fulfilled because something worked or
rejected because something went wrong
let me show you what this actually looks
like in this example I'm wrapping an
image tag loader in a promise because I
want to do some work after the image
loads on the page I'm using the image
tags onload handler to specify success
unload calls resolved which queues up
the function passed to then to execute
after this function finishes executing
note the JavaScript engine does not
immediately stop executing this function
upon calling resolved in this case
that's the last piece of work so
effectively it's the end of the function
however that's not always the case check
the link in the instructor notes to see
what I mean being able to call resolve
and reject is important this is what
gives you the flexibility to explicitly
say what constitutes fulfillment and
what constitutes rejection for the
promise when either resolve or reject
has been called the promise has been
settled and then at that point the next
part of the chain usually a dot then or
it could be a dot catch is then executed
back to the original example any value
passed to resolve or reject will be
received as an argument by this
subsequent dot then or dot catch in the
event that nothing is passed to resolve
or reject as is the case here with
reject then it's totally fine
the next link in the chain
simply receives undefined there's a
third case and that is if the value
that's passed is a promise if so then
the promise will execute first and then
whatever value it resolves to will be
passed to the next link in the chain
note that resolve and reject have the
same syntax resolve leads to the next
then in the chain while reject leads to
the next catch incidentally if there is
a JavaScript air somewhere in the body
of the promise dot catch will also
automatically get called and by the way
there's a bit more to air handling and
you'll be learning about it in the next
lesson in the meantime it is time for
you to write your first promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
