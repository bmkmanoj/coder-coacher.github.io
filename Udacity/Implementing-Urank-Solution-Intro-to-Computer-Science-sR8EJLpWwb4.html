line we need to add the line at line 13
and the line that we need is to update
the graph so we're going to have a new
entry in the graph that is the page that
we're crawling so that's going to be the
key for the entry that we want to
associate with that page a list of the
links that you can reach from that page
all the outgoing links well that's
exactly what we stored in the variable
out links so that's the only line of
code that we need to add to produce the
graph we needed to initialize the graph
as an empty dictionary we needed to
change to return it but the only
substantive change was adding this line
and we'll run that will call crawl web
passing in the test URL and this time we
have two variables on the left side so
we're going to assign the index to index
and we'll assign the graph to graph and
let's check that the graph has what it
should so we'll print out to get graph
entry for the index page and what we get
we see a list of five URLs hummus
arsenic kathleen nickel and zinc and
this corresponds to the picture here we
had five outgoing links from the index
page to those five other pages let's
look at another one we can print the
graph for the Kathleen page and that had
no outgoing links so what we see here is
the empty list and we can see the whole
graph we have each URL with a list of
all the pages that that page links to so
both the hummus and the Kathleen page
don't link to anything the zinc page
links to the nickel page and the arsenic
page and so on so now we have our graph
the next step is to figure out how to
use that graph to do the page ranks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
