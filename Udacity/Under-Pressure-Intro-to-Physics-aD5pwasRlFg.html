being placed under pressure well if i
look at this balloon i can apply
pressure to it by exerting a force over
its area and when i do well the balloon
actually gets a little bit smaller the
air inside the balloon gets a little
more densely packed together and in fact
this is exactly what happens on earth
out here far away from the surface of
the earth there aren't very many air
molecules this is a low-pressure
environment and with nothing to weigh
down on these air molecules from above
they're basically free to play they're
free to move around now below this outer
layer of the atmosphere well all these
air molecules are sort of weighing on
the atoms below it the molecules below
it and so these become a little more
densely packed and as we go even further
down towards the surface of the earth or
us humans tend to live theater gets even
more densely packed and so we see that
down near the surface of the earth where
we have high pressure we also have a
high density of air molecules and as
high density of air molecules makes us
humans living at the surface very happy
so I want to know why do humans like
high pressure so much maybe the weight
from all that air above us keeps us from
growing too tall maybe air pollution
tends to go to regions of low pressure
or maybe it means that there's lots of
oxygen for us to breathe go ahead and
