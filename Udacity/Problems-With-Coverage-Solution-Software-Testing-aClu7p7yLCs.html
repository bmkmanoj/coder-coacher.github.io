formality test and what I've done is
I've changed the inputs a little bit so
let's run it on these new inputs and
what we can see is the function has now
made a couple of mistakes for example it
has indicated that 9 is prime and it has
indicated that 25 is prime or of course
neither of those numbers is prime so
let's go back to the code and look at
the mistake the algorithm here is
generally a valid one it's fine to first
of all special case the even numbers and
it's fine then to loop between three and
the square root of the number so the
problem is is that pythons range
function doesn't loop through three and
the square root of the input number
rather it loops between three and one
less than the square root of the input
number so we can fix this of course
easily by adding one to the square root
causing it to actually test against the
full range that it needs to test in
order to have a successful / malady test
so let us run this code and see what
happens so six is not prime seven is
none of the rest of these numbers are
prime except for 29 so the question is
what happened here why did test coverage
fail to identify the bug an answer is
sort of simple statement coverage is a
rather crude metric that only checks
whether each statement executes once
each statement executes at-least once
that lets lots of bugs through for
example we can have a statement executes
but it computes the wrong numerical
answer or what happened here a loop
executed but it executed for the wrong
number of times competing the wrong
result the lesson here is we should not
let complete coverage plus the number of
successful test cases fool us into
thinking that a piece of code is right
it's often the case the deeper analysis
is necessary</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
