was on either side of the equation just
because I prefer to have X on the left
side of the equation this is just a
personal preference it doesn't change
the map that we're doing at all I also
set y equal to 0 since we are after all
looking for the roots of this equation
now what we notice here is that you can
actually factor this expression on the
left x squared plus 8x plus 16 is just
equal to the quantity x + 4 x the
quantity x + 4 while these two factors
are clearly both going to give us the
same route since they are equal to each
other so from this we just get one
equation X plus 4 equals 0 that needs to
be satisfied in order for this equation
to be satisfied so we get a root of x
equals negative 4 now even though we
only got one answer here for X we must
notice that the factor that this came
from appears twice in the equation so
it's not so much that there's just one
solution it's that the two roots of this
parabola happen to be identical to one
another in fact this route is so special
that it gets a special name it's called
a double root</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
