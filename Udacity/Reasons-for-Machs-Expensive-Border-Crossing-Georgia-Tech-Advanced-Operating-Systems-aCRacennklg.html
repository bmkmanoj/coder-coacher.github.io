crossing is it's focused on portability
what that means is that the Mach
microkernel is architecture independent
to allow that Mach microkernel to run on
several different processor
architectures what that means is that
there's going to be a code bloat in the
Mach microkernel because it has to have
the personality for any architecture
that it may need to run on in particular
in the Mach microkernel there is an
architecture independent part of the
microkernel and architecture specific
part of the microkernel the two together
results in a significant code bloat
which means it has a large memory
footprint which means it has lesser
locality which means you're gonna have
more cache misses and pollution of the
cache and that is the reason why I have
a longer latency for border crossing in
mark as opposed to the theoretically
smallest number of processor cycles in
order to go from user space to kernel
space as I mentioned earlier lead-k did
back-of-the-envelope calculation on the
same processor hardware and said that it
should take about 107 cycles to go from
user space to kernel space and then he
implemented l3 microkernel ensured that
it took only hundred and twenty-three
processor cycles to do that and the
reason for marks expensive border
crossing is all due to the fact that
there's code bloat resulting in more
cache misses and therefore incurring
long Allegiance II for border crossing
so in other words mark kernels memory
footprint is the culprit for the expense
of border crossing it is not the
philosophy or the principle of
microkernel based operating system
design because by proof of construction
l3 has shown that you can have very
minimal border crossing overhead by
careful construction another way of
seeing it is that portability which was
one of the main concerns in mark design
performance are at loggerheads with each
other so if you focus on portability you
may sacrifice performance and that's
what we saw when we look at the
difference between Marc's performance
and l-3 performance on the same
processing hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
