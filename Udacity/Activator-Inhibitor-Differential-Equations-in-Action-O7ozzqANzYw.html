or rather our final final exam question
this one is about something called
morphogenesis this relates to how an
organism knows where to grow its legs or
where to form colored stripes on its
coat and things like that
this really concerns pattern formation
then an Alan Turing of all people
brilliant man had an idea that initially
only slightly random distribution of
chemicals can evolve into a stable
pattern over time so we're going to look
at one model of how that could happen
let's say that we have two different
chemicals we have one that we're going
to call the activator and one that we're
going to call the inhibitor or the
activator causes production of both
itself and of the inhibitor it also
diffuses slowly through the space that
we're considering the inhibitor on the
other hand causes a reduction of both
the activator and itself and it diffuses
very quickly through this space so we
can look at our graph over here the
x-axis is just a space in general and
the y-axis is concentration of either
chemical now if you consider what's
happening in the curves inside this blue
circle you can see that where there's a
little bit more activator than inhibitor
the activator level rises due to
diffusion the inhibitor that is also
produced then flows quickly away because
this is fast diffusion and it stops
other Peaks from developing nearby we
have equations for how the concentration
of the activator inhibitor changed with
time going to call the concentration of
the activator a and the concentration of
the inhibitor be this constant right
here it shows us that yes in fact the
activator is very slow-moving as opposed
to this constant over here which shows
that the inhibitor acts on a much
shorter timescale back over in the
equation for da/dt this factor of 1
minus a squared limits the growth of a
when a tends toward 1 or toward negative
1 this is basically similar to logistic
growth back in the equation for DP DT we
see that when a is greater than zero
since the term of just plus a is added
in this forces both a and B upward since
we have minus 0.7 B however whenever B
is greater than zero
this forces a and B both downward
looking at the code the final task the
problem is actually going to be to use
the explicit finite difference scheme
for this activator inhibitor model that
I just showed you the equations for da
DT and DB DT however before you get to
that step there are two other tasks that
you
complete both task 1 and task 2 concern
using periodic boundary conditions just
to help you visualize this I'm going to
draw a little diagram we're considering
a grid of some length by some length and
it's made up of all of these little
squares just like we've seen so many
times before we know how the conditions
in this square relate to the conditions
in the adjacent square and so on and so
forth we can progress horizontally
across the square until we reach the
boundary now however we have a problem
what am I going to do with all the
information that I have about this
square in the same way where does the
information about this square come from
periodic boundary conditions say if I
pretend to create one more square
outside of the boundaries of the grid
then this square is going to be
identical to the first square on the
opposite side where we started we can do
the same thing moving in the opposite
direction horizontally and also in both
directions vertically so for task 1 and
task 2 of this final problem you're
going to figure out what expressions are
needed to ensure that these boundary
conditions are put in place in the end
you should come up with some pretty
interesting looking patterns I'm just
going to give you a sneak peak of what
you should end up with so here's what
you'll get with your final plot we have
one graph showing the concentration of
the activator throughout the entire
space we're considering and the other
graph showing the concentration of the
inhibitor congratulations on some
awesome work in this course I hope
you've had fun seeing how many different
kinds of problems can be solved using
numerical approximation methods I know
that this course has taught me to look
at the world in a totally different way
great job on the final exam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
