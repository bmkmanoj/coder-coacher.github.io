software for reference this is the
result of the forward Euler method with
a step size of half a day we already saw
that the Euler method with step sizes of
two or more but they're surprised to pay
for the stability of the beckford Euler
method the code gets really complex as
opposed as opposed to the code of the
forward Euler method you really do need
pencil and paper to derive these
equations that's what we are going to do
now the equation for our the number of
recovered persons is the easiest one
we'll start with that and to save space
let me write underscore one for the
current quantities and subscript two or
the quantities of the next step the
forward Euler method would turn this
into the following the value of our one
step later is the current value of our
plus step size times the current rate of
change which is one over five days times
the current value of I by one in my new
notation this would be the forward Euler
method but now we're concerned with a
beckford Euler method which means that
we have to use the rate at the end of
that step meaning I 2 has to go in here
and now we're done we know the current
value of our we have computed the next
value of I in the lines before and
that's all we need to compute the next
value of our next up is s if we were
using the forward Euler method this
would work as follows the next value of
s is its current value plus the time
step times its current rate of change
meaning minus 5 times 10 to the mine
per day in person times I at the current
step s at the current step if we were
doing forward Euler but now that we are
doing backward Euler this has to be I
won't step after that and s one step
after that you bring this term to the
left hand side because we're interested
in s2 and we factor out s to Seoul as
factor of 1 times s 2 and now it's Plus
this coefficient times I 2 times s 2
times 10 to the minus ninth power / day
in person hi - and all that remains on
the right hand side is s1 and now that
is simple to solve as 2 equals s 1
divided by the very same expression that
we've got here I'm lazy I don't spell it
out this completes the computation of s2
4 which we need
I - but we have computed that in a line
before and now the equation for the rate
of change of I the number of infectious
persons exposed persons that is infected
persons become infectious for the
certain time constant and infectious
persons recover with another time
constant if we were implementing forward
Euler we would be doing the following I
to the value for the next step
equals the current value plus the time
step times the current rate of change
which is 1 over one day Eve 1 minus 1
over 5 days I won but now we want to
implement the backward Euler method
which means that we have to use the
values for the next time step in this
rate of change I bring this term with
the I 2 over to the left hand side and
factor out the I 2 this leaves me with 1
I 2 plus h times 1 over 5 days on the
right hand side I 1 remains and H times
1 over 1 day e 2 remains and now we can
divide by this expression and find I 2
equals the right hand side divided by
this expression I 1 plus h times 1 over
1 day times e 2 divided by this
expression this completes the equation
for I the main message here is that
implicit methods come at a price so I
think these equations can get very ugly
if you are convinced at this moment you
may want to skip the rest of the segment
otherwise stay with me to see how we can
compute e 2 which by the way is needed
to be able to compute I - a trick to
find the value of e for the next time
step is to look at these two
differential equations and
for the first one the backward Euler
method says the value for the next time
step is the value for the current time
step plus the time step times our
estimate of the rate of change for the
next time step which is five times ten
to the minus ninth power per day and
person times I to is to Beckford Euler
minus one over one day II to backward
Euler again
not even for s the new value as the old
one plus the time step times minus our
coefficient five times ten to the minus
ninth power per day in person times hi
to s to Beckford Allah again that's it
if you know form the sum of these two
equations you get e 2 plus s 2 equals e
1 plus s 1 this active expression
cancels with that ugly expression and we
are left with H times minus 1 over one
day e 2 so this is what we have reached
by now
Eve 1 the current value is known as 1
the current value is known we want to
determine eetu the next value at this
point we do not yet know as 2 at luckily
enough we derived an equation for s 2
before namely s 2 equals as 1 divided by
1 plus the step size times 5 times 10 to
the minus ninth power divided by days
and persons times i2 and we have an
equation for I 2 that says 2 equals PI 1
plus step size times 1 over 1 day e 2
divided by 1 plus step size times 1 over
5 days if you use this equation to
express I 2 and then insert this result
as s 2 you end up with an equation that
contains e 2 and E 1 and s 1 and can be
solved for e 2 e 2 appears in three
places and with a little algebra you can
turn the resulting equation into a
quadratic equation and use the standard
solution formula for quadratic equations
the result is what you see in the code
this is now really convincing that
working with implicit solvers requires
quite some effort with pen and paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
