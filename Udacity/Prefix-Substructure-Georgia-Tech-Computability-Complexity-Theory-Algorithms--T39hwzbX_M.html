sequence alignment problem comes from
aligning prefixes of the sequence that
we want to align we define CIJ to be the
minimum cost of aligning the first I
characters of X with the first J
characters of Y since X has em
characters total and why has end
characters our overall goal then is to
compute C M comma n and the alignment
that achieves it let's consider this
problem of computing cmn and in
particular will consider what we do with
the last characters of each sequence
there are three cases to consider first
suppose that we match the last two
characters of the sequence together like
so then the cost would be the minimum
cost of aligning the first n minus 1
characters of X with the first n minus 1
characters of y plus the costs
associated with matching these two
characters another possibility is that
we leave the last character of the X
sequence unmatched then the cost would
be the minimum cost of aligning the
first M minus 1 characters of X with the
first n characters of y plus 1 for
leaving X sub M unmatched in the case
where we leave y sub n unmatched is
analogous of course cmn is defined to be
the minimum cost of aligning the
sequences so it must be the minimum of
these three possibilities notice however
that there was nothing special about the
fact that we were using em and in here
and the same argument applies to all
combination of I and J the problems are
similar so we can replace M and n with I
and J like so adding the base cases
where the cost of aligning a sequence
with the empty sequence is just the
length of the sequence we have a
recursive formulation the optimal
solution expressed in terms of optimal
solutions to similar subproblems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
