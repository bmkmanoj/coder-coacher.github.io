media player API s but you may have just
copy and pasted the lines of code that
you needed and you probably still have
some questions about how exactly it all
works so let's talk about that now so
the media player is a complex class
because it can play both audio and video
files so these media files can be
bundled with the app just like how the
song file was included in our sample app
earlier or they can be streamed from the
Internet to give you an idea of how much
the media player is capable of here's
the list of all the different file types
that the media player on Android can
support so you see here we can have mp3
AAC WAV files and much much much more by
the way the file types are just
different approaches to storing audio in
a digital form all while minimizing file
size and maintaining sound quality so
this is similar to how there are
different image types such as jpg gif
PNG and etc so in the case of the New
York app we're gonna provide you with
mp3 files of Andre and speaking the
words aloud this way you can include the
files within the app and they don't need
to be streamed from the internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
