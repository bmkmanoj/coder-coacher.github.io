with a very active research program
there are a number of exciting part is
going on right now here is a small list
of them callow is a project in which a
cognitive assistant learns and organizes
knowledge callow in fact was a precursor
for the CD program of Apple psyche and
OMCs OMCs stands for open mind common
sense saikat OMCs a two large knowledge
bases to support everyday common sense
reasoning wolframalpha as a new kind of
search engine that uses some of the same
kind of knowledge structures we have
considered in this particular class
different from many other search engines
the three projects in the right column a
projects here at Georgia Tech Rita is
the computational model of visual
thinking and autism in particular it
solves problems on the Raven progresses
matrice tests using only visual spatial
representations dramatis is the
computational model suspense and drama
and stories recall that in this class we
talked about a theory of humor and
surprise dramatis tries to do the same
thing for suspense data is a system for
supporting design based on analogous to
natural systems we had come across this
idea of biologically inspired design
earlier in the class and Danes suppose
that kind of biologically inspired
design we have provided references to
these and many other knowledge-based AI
projects in the class notes you're
welcome to explore depending on your
interests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
