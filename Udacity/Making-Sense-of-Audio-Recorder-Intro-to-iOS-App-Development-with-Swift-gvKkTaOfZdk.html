are importing avfoundation at the very
top this tells me that we will use a
library from this framework and sure
enough we use av audio recorder which
sounds like a library that will help us
record audio if we look at how this
object audio recorder is being
initialized a little bit further down
the code we will notice that while
creating its instance we are giving it
something called a file path now this
seems like the path or the address of a
file on our phone where we actually want
to record our audio and it seems that
this last line will actually record the
audio so far so good let's investigate
this thing called file path a little bit
more now all of this code here it seems
to me is helping us get to the file path
or the location of our recorded on you
it looks like this line of code here is
getting the path of a directory within
our app now the thing to notice here is
that our app can't just store a file
anywhere on the phone that would
actually create serious security
implications so what we are doing is
getting the path to the document
directory within our app this is a place
where our app is actually permitted to
store files then we are getting the
current date and time from the phone and
converting it into this format and it
seems to me that we are using that as
the name of our audio file I think what
this mechanism does is that it ensures
that no two audio files are of the same
name in our documents directory folder
alright now that we have a high-level
understanding of this code let's add
this to our project and see if it works
by the way all of this code is available
in the instructor notes for you to
experiment with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
