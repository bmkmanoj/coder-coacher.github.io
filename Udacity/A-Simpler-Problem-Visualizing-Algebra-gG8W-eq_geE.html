third of strawberry icing and one half a
vanilla icing together I need a way to
compare one-third and one-half of the
cake if I cut the cake into equal sized
pieces for both of them then I could add
the parts together let's split up our
cake into 6 i'm going to split every
third into two equal parts doing that i
can see i get 26 of the cake is covered
in strawberry icing so how did I get
from 13 to 26 we doubled the number of
pieces we had altogether I went from
three pieces 26 so I know I needed to
multiply the denominator by 2 I also
doubled the number of pieces I had I had
one out of three and now I have two out
of six notice i'm multiplying by the
number one 2/2 is still one I'm just
changing what this fraction looks like
i'm not changing its value we can still
see one third is 26 i'm going to use the
same approach to make one half into 6
i'm going to split up this cake into six
to change from halves 26 i need to
multiply by 3 over 3 I know 2 times 3
gives me 6 and then for the numerator 1
times 3 is 3 visually I can see that one
half of the cake frosted in vanilla
icing is the same as 36 of the cake also
frosted in manila icing I x 1 here so
I'm not changing the value of this
fraction I'm just changing what it looks
like now that I have my cakes put up
into six I have 26 of it frosted in
strawberry icing and 36 of it frosted
and vanilla icing now I can just add my
six together I have the same size pieces
so I can just count them up I can see
that 26 and 36 all together makes five
six and here's what it would look like
on one cake I have half of it covered in
vanilla icing and a third of it covered
in strawberry icing this would be 16 of
the cake 26 of the cake 36 of the cake
for six of the cake and 56 of the cake
so when my fractions were just one-third
and one-half I couldn't add them
together I had to get a common
denominator first I to get them into the
same size pieces so how do i add
fractions together once I have a common
denominator let's try this with a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
