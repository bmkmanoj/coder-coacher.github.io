converting non-deterministic machines to
deterministic ones here I've written a
non-deterministic machine it has
ambiguity right in state one there are
two ways to go on a it also has epsilon
transitions and I'll start making its
deterministic equivalent down here well
when we enter the non-deterministic
machine we could only be in state 1 but
after that we could see an A and if I
see an AI could be in 24 or I could take
the free epsilon transition 25 or I
could keep going and take the free
epsilon transition to six so i'll label
my new state to four five six because it
keeps track of every where I could have
my fingers if i'm simulating this
non-deterministic machine now should
this state be an accepting state or not
well remember that a finite state
machine accepts if there's any path to
an accepting state and six is one of our
accepting states because the original
machine could accept a a epsilon epsilon
when we want our new machine to also
accept a a win so in my converted world
the state accepts if any of its
corresponding original states also
accept let's say that I'm in either to
four five or six and ICS see if I'm in
too and I csci fall off the world if I'm
in for fall off the world five I go to
six looking good six fall off the world
so here if I was in to four or five or
six and I see a sea I end up just in
state six and that's definitely an
accepting state now there are some other
ways to get out of two four five and six
and when we do we might be in states two
or three since three is an accepting
state up there two or three is an
accepting state down here if I'm in two
or three on a be from to I go to three
and see i'd fall off the world so we'd
end up in state three if I'm in two or
three and I CSC I must really have been
in state three and I stay in state three
so either on B or C we end up in just
state 3 which is also an accepting state
and if I'm in state 3 there's a self
loop back to state 3 no
I filled out almost all of this
deterministic equivalent but I forgot to
label an edge help me out as the quiz
what should the label for this edge be
so that this deterministic equivalent
and this non-deterministic machine
except exactly the same language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
