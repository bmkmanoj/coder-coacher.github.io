originated in the 60s at IBM when the
norm of computing was that there were a
few large mainframe computers they were
shared by many users and many business
services in order to concurrently run
very diverse workloads on the same
physical Hardware without requiring that
a single operating system be used for
all of the applications for all of the
possible purposes it was necessary to
come up with a model where multiple
operating systems can concurrently be
deployed on the same hardware platform
with virtualization each of the
operating systems that are deployed on
the same physical platform has an
illusion that it actually owns the
underlying hardware resources or at
least some smaller portion of them for
instance the operating system may think
that it owns some smaller amount of
memory compared to the memory that's
actually available on the physical
machine each operating system together
with its applications as well as the
virtual resources that it thinks that
else is called a virtual machine or a VM
for short this represents a virtual
machine because it is distinct from the
physical machine that is natively
managed by some software stack virtual
machines are often referred to as guests
such as guest VMs
or also refer to as domains like a guest
domain for instance to support the
coexistence of multiple virtual machines
on the same physical machine requires
some underlying functionality in order
to deal with the allocation and the
management of the real physical Hardware
resources in addition it's necessary to
provide some isolation guarantees across
these VMs
this is provided by the virtualization
layer that is referred to as virtual
machine monitor or hypervisor also there
are multiple ways in which the
functionality that's required by the
virtualization layer can be designed and
implemented and in this lesson we will
describe some of the key virtualization
related techniques</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
