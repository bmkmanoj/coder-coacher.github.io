increasing tessellation can make the
lighting computations look better
however if you turn up the shininess you
can still pick out problems also along
the edges of the sphere the density of
the triangles is much higher than in the
middle if we keep increasing the spheres
tessellation we'll be making a huge
number of triangles along the fringe
which will cost this computation time
without adding much to the final image
ideally what we'd like to evaluate is
the reflection model each pixel this is
an entirely fine solution instead of
interpolating the RGB values that result
from computing the effects of lighting
we interpolate anything we need in the
reflection model in this case all we
need to interpolate is the shading
normal what this means on the GPU is
that we have the vertex shader we input
the position in normal as before for
output we get the screen position and
instead of an RGB computed from the
reflection equation we put out
transformed normal on the output these
two normals are the vertex normals and
they're interpolated per pixel this
interpreted normal is input to the
fragment shader which then evaluates the
reflection model and computes the RGB to
be displayed I should mention one
important point with normal
interpolation the interpolated normals
will not be normalized that is their
length will not all be one as you can
see in this drawing the interpolated
normals are always a bit shorter when
interpolation occurs so each normal
should be normalized before using it in
the lighting computation when we
interpolate normals and evaluate the
reflection model at each pixel this is
called per pixel shading or Phong
shading confusingly fog invented to cool
things one was the Phong reflection
model which gives us a specular
highlight shiny spot the other is this
Phong shading where we interpolate data
across the triangle and compute the
color per pixel this is compared with
Goro shading where the color is computed
at each vertex and is interpolated
between those two try running the new
demo and see how functioning vastly
improves image quality there's a cost of
course and that the de lighting
calculations need to be performed much
more frequently but this is often what
you need if you want to have a good
specular highlight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
