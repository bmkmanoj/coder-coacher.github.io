syntax that is pretty handy that I'll
use a lot in this course and it's just
for doing a for loop so the syntax is
very much like that of the if statement
in fact we use all statements are like
this so it's going to look like this
curly brace and then we'll have our for
statement percent close curly brace and
then we can have our the body of the for
statement and just like the if statement
we have a closing block as well and our
for statement will be just like the
Python for statement and this has allows
us to execute or print or whatever
whatever is in body do that you know in
a loop which is really handy in a
template so let's go ahead and see a
quick example of that okay we're gonna
leave our end the way it is okay and
let's replace our if statement demo with
a little for statement demo so I'm gonna
put all of this in an ordered list now
we use unordered list before remember UL
o L is just ordered list which means
that actually print the item number it's
kind of handy so we're going to say for
X and range 1 to n plus 1 so this will
basically if n is 10 this will go from 1
to 10 notice they put a list item for X
to the power of 2 x squared which is
Python syntax for doing that now I
notice inside the double curly braces
remember this just means print so and we
can put just about any arbitrary Python
inside here which indeed is what I've
done so X the power of 2 and then we end
our for statement and we close our list
so let's go ahead and see if this works
I'm going to set n to 10 and indeed it
works and we can see this basically is
printing X 1 through 10 along in the
left column and then x squared in the
right column let's go ahead and view the
source for this file you can see down
here here's the code we generated
ordered list and then 1 4 9 you know 1
squared 2 squared 3 squared 4 squared
all the way down to 10 squared and then
close ordered list and so the template
made it really handy to do that let's go
ahead and see what would happen if I
change this ordered list to an unordered
list in our code so if we change this Oh
L to a ul and we go back to Chrome and
we reload this page you see the Oh
change to you and we go here instead of
getting the numbers for our list items
we get the little dots it comes up from
time to time
these days you often just generate your
list markers yourself using templates
but you know for quick and dirty you can
just use olr UL to get to get what you
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
