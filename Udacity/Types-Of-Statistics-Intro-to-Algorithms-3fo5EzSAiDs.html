understand lots of really important
statistics start with the letter M so
today's statistics have been brought to
you by the letter M here are some of
those statistics maximum is the largest
value in L the minimum is the smallest
value in L the midpoint is the average
of the max in the men sort of the
halfway point between the largest value
and the smallest value the mean is the
average of the values in Al and I'll say
mean sometimes or average sometimes also
expected value basically means the same
thing the mode is the most common value
in L if there's repeats the median is
say the middle list number ms list value
in L basically the number so that half
the numbers are bigger and half of them
are smaller and that there can be ties
so we'll have to be a little bit of care
a little bit careful how we define that
but essentially it is that the value
that would be in the middle of a sorted
list and all these different notions of
statistics all give us a way of taking a
really long list of values and then
grinding them together to make a single
number that fits comfortably inside of
our brains</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
