colt is overdoing it a bit after all he
does have a tendency to come on strong
and anyway performance is important in
that way that dental cleanings are
everyone knows you should think about
getting them but nobody really wants to
but as any grandmother would tell you
you don't actually have to floss all of
your teeth just the ones that you want
to keep and similarly you don't need to
think about performance for all of your
abs just the ones that you want to
succeed because Colt brought up a good
point users will complain about bad
performance three times as often as any
other issues so keep in mind that just
because your app works beautifully in
your development environment with its
perfect Wi-Fi on your fancy new test
phone doesn't mean that it will always
work well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
