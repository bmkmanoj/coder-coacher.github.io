burlap domain so now let's add actions
to the domain as well to add actions to
domain objects we generate we can use a
method built into the graph to find
domain class set to transition this
method is used to define both the set of
actions and the transition function for
the MDP the first argument is an int
giving the ID of the state s we are
transitioning from the second argument
is also an int giving the ID of the
action we are defining I'll talk about
that more in just a second the third
argument is an int giving the ID of the
state t we are transitioning into and
the fourth argument is a double giving
the probability of transitioning to
state t upon taking this action note
that many different actions coming out
of the same state can have the same ID
but the probabilities of the actions
with the same ID leaving a given state
must add up to one looking at our state
diagram again if we want to define the
action a taking us from state 0 to state
1 we can call set transition with the
arguments 0 for the ID of the state we
are leaving 0 since this is the first
action we're defining from state 0 1
which is the ID of the state we are
transitioning into and one and I'm
adding a decimal point to denote that
this is a double since this is a
deterministic action with probability 1
we will always enter state 1 by taking
action 0 from state 0 to define action B
we call set transition with the
arguments 0 again because we are leaving
state 0 1 since this is going to be
action one from state 0 2 which is the
ID of the state we are entering and one
dot since we again this is a
deterministic action with probability 1
this action will always take us from s 0
to s 2 similarly action C will be
defined by calling set transition with
arguments 0 2 since this is action to
coming out from state 0 3 for the ID of
the state we're entering and one since
this is a deterministic action now let's
put this into our code notice that I am
casting this dot DG which is our domain
generator object to a graph defined
domain before calling set transition
this is needed because set transition is
not defined for the domain generator
class another point to notice is that we
are defining all of these actions before
we call this DG generate domain we're
calling the set transition functions
first because it tells the graph to find
domain object to include these
transitions in its blueprint when it
generates a new domain object calling
generate domain first would create a
domain with six states but no
transitions as I found out myself as I
was learning to use burlap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
