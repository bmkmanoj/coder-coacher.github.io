know a single one of these angles and
one of the sides as well I can learn
everything there is to know I can learn
the other angle by using the fact that
they must add up to 180 degrees I can
find the other sides by using these
trigonometric ratios great but there's
one thing we can't do quite yet and
that's to go from sides back to angles
so let's say I gave you a right triangle
and I told you this side was 231 meters
and this side was 266 meters all right
let's say now you want to know something
about one of the angles what's this
angle for example now initially this
seems a bit tricky and it is well what
we can do is even though I don't know
what this angle is yet maybe I know
something about this angle so for this
angle would it be easy for me to
calculate the sine the cosine or the
tangent of this angle check up here
which would be easiest tangent sine or
cosine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
