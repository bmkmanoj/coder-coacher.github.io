is how I work in terms of what things I
have open this is something that I
always try to get guys who work with me
at reddit and now hit month to do got
your browser you're running your things
in it and you've got your editor with
your code in it new browsers got some
pictures some text if your screen is big
enough I like to have them side by side
but sometimes that's not the case
something people often neglect is having
your terminal nearby I almost always
like whether I'm doing a Benjen or my
own stuff we run the app server out of a
terminal so you can see the logs if
you're developing without being able to
see your logs there's so much stuff
you're gonna miss I find many many bugs
just by using my website as I'm
developing and watching how that how the
log Scrolls because many times there's
an error that you're not even aware of
that could be a big deal in production
you could have fixed it in five seconds
if you just noticed the logs scrolling
weird and another important thing and
this is one of my frustrations in App
Engine right now is it's critical if
you're writing code that writes to a
database that the queries that you're
running are printed to the log I've kind
of tried different strategies of hacking
my App Engine to print every time it
runs a query because if you've got some
complicated setup with your database in
your cache and you're memcache and maybe
a local cache and all sorts of things
you want to make sure it's working and I
know when I'm developing often
introduced bugs that uh somehow prevent
something from being cached properly and
if I'm browsing along and I see all
these database queries scrolling by that
shouldn't be that's a sign that
something's broken and I want to make
sure generally that every page I run
doesn't hit the database unless
absolutely require if I see a query
running that shouldn't be you know I can
catch it by just having a log open try
to get in the habit of when you're
switched from your editor to your
browser that you instead switch from
your editor to your browser plus a
terminal so you can see things working
you start to get a sense for how the log
Scrolls when your websites working
normally so when it deviates you can
detect it faster you'll save yourself a
lot of heartache doing it that way now
I'd like to move on to how we actually
built some of these websites that I've
been referring to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
