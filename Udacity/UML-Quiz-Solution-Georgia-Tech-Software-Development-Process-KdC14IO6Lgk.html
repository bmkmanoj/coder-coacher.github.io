answers so you should have marked
several of those so let's go through the
list well this is definitely not true
they are used for something the second
answer is a correct one because you can
order the use cases that you plan to
realize according to your prioritization
criteria so basically what you're doing
you're prioritizing either in terms of
functionality so you can decide which
piece of functionality you want to
realize first in your system all you can
also prioritize based on the actors
involved maybe there are some actors
maybe there are some user roles that you
want to support before others and we'll
see some examples of that the next
correct question is that they can be
used for requirement elicitation why
well because use cases Express what the
system is supposed to do for each user
they're an ideal way to collect
represent and check functional
requirements and we'll also get back to
this
and finally use cases can definitely be
used for test case design so why is that
because each use case that represents a
scenario of interaction between users
and the system so testers can very
naturally construct test cases based on
use cases and in addition and most
importantly they can do that even in the
absence of code that realized a use case
so they can do it as soon as they have
the requirements they don't have to wait
until the code is ready so this is
another very important point so you can
have your test cases ready even before
writing the code and now for
completeness even though this is not
listed in the quiz I also want to
mention two additional users for use
cases the first one is that use cases
can be used to estimate effort as we
will discuss in more detail in min
equals four when we talk about agile
software development and they can also
be used by customers to assess
requirements which is another
fundamentally important role of the use
cases they provide a common language
between the customers and the developers
which makes it easier to collect the
write requirements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
