control transfer overhead and that is
the conflict switches that have to
happen in order to effect an RPC call
and return and let's now look at the
context which is that happen in doing
the RPC let's say this is the client
machine and on the client machine the
client is making a call so to making the
call and mother call is made the colonel
list you say oh this client wants to
make an RPC call and we know that the
semantics of RPC is that the client is
blocked until the results of the trend
and therefore the operating system on
the client side will switch from the
current client that is making the call
to another process let's call it c1 so
this is the first context which that is
going to happen on the client box the
RPC call is centered on the wire reaches
the server machine and when it reaches
the server machine the server machine is
executing some arbitrary process let's
call its s-1 so when the call comes in
the colonel has to switch to the
particular server process that is going
to handle this incoming RPC call so this
is a second context which so the server
machine and the operating system on the
server machine is currently executing
some process s1 so it has to switch to s
in order to answer the incoming RPC call
so that is the second context which that
happens then the server procedure
execute and once the server procedure is
completed execution it's now going to
send the results out and when it wants
to send the results out at that point
the work is done for the server and so
the server operating system has to
switch from s to some of the process s2
so that's again a context switch that's
going to happen because the server is
done with whatever it has to do so
that's the third context which then the
car pc result is coming over the wire
come to the client side exactly similar
to what happened over here when it comes
back to the client side the colonel at
that point is executing some process c2
and this particular result message is
coming back saying that well the
original call sent out on behalf of this
client see the
results have come back now it is time to
reschedule this client so that this
client can receive the results and
continue with this execution remember
that the semantic it's like a procedure
called but it is a remote procedure call
the client is blocked for the resultant
come back and when the result comes back
the kernel can schedule the client to
continue with its execution so that's
what is going on so potentially there
are four conflict switches that are
going on now let's look at these
conflicts which is and figure out what
conflicts which is a critical now this
context which is essentially to make
sure that the client box is not being
underutilized right so once the client
has made this call till the result comes
back the client box is underutilized and
therefore the operating system says well
let me switch to some other process that
can do some useful work on this node so
that is this context which not critical
from the point of view of the latency
for our pc now when the message comes
over here this context which is crucial
because at this point when the RPC call
comes in this guy the server box is
executing some other process s1 so it
has to switch to this server process s
which can actually execute the RPC call
so this is an essential part of the RPC
latency and similarly to this conflicts
which that I talked about this context
which is happening in order to make sure
that the server's machine is not under
utilized when the server is done with
the RPC call it's going to send the
results back and therefore we need two
conflicts which out of this server
process to some other process so that we
can utilize this server box that's this
conflicts which again similar to this
context which this context which is not
in the critical path of RPC latency</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
