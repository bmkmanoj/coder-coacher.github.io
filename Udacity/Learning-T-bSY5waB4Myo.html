methods for doing these things they may
not correspond exactly to what rich
Sutton did so keep that in mind but I've
used these methods in practice and found
them to work really well let's start
with learning T remember T of s a s
prime represents the probability that if
we are in state s take action a we will
end up in state s prime to learn a model
of T we're just going to observe how
these transitions occur so in other
words we'll have an experience with the
real world we'll get back on s a s prime
and we'll just count how many times did
it happen so I'm going to introduce a
new table I call T count or TC and it
goes like this
so we initialize all of our T count
values to be a very very small number
the reason for that is later on you'll
see that if we don't do that we could
get in a situation where we have a
divided by zero then we begin executing
q-learning
and each time we interact with the real
world we observe si and s Prime and then
we just increment that location in our T
count
matrix so every time we see a transition
from s to s prime with action a boom we
add a 1 and that's pretty it's pretty
simple that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
