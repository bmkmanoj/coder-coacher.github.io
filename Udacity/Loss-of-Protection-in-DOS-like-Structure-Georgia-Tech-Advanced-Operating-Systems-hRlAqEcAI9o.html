dass like structure is simply
unacceptable for a general purpose
operating system today on the other hand
the monolithic structure gives the
protection that is so important at the
same time what it strives to do is also
it reduces the potential for performance
loss but consolidating all the services
in one big monolithic structure that is
even though an application has to go
from its address space into the
operating systems address space in order
to get some service it is usually the
case that the operating system has
several components and they have to talk
to one another in order to provide the
service there an application once think
about the file system for instance you
make a call to the file system to open a
file and the file system then may have
to call the storage module in order to
find out where exactly a file is
residing and it may have to contact the
memory manager module to see where it
wants to bring in a file that you want
to open and see the contents of so in
this sense there's a lot of interaction
that's going to go on under the cover
inside the operating system between
components of the operating system in
order to satisfy a single service call
from an application so this monolithic
structure ensures that even though we
have to go from an application into the
operating systems address base once
you're inside the operating systems
address space then potential for
performance loss is avoided by the
consolidation of all the components that
comprise the operating system but what
is lost in the monolithic structure that
is the ability to customize the
operating system service for different
applications
this model of one size fits all so far a
system service is concerned with the
monolithic structure shuts out the
opportunity for customizing the
operating system service for the needs
of different applications
now you may wonder why do we need to
customize the operating system service
for different applications
why not one size fits all why is there
an issue if we look at a couple of
examples the need for customization will
become fairly obvious for example
interactive video games the requirement
of applications that are providing a
video game experience for the user or
consider another application which is
computing all the prime numbers you can
immediately see that the operating
system needs for these two classes of
applications are perhaps very different
on the one hand for the little kid who
is playing a video game the key
determinant of a good operating system
would be responsiveness how quickly the
operating system is responding to his
nifty moves while he plays his video
game on the other hand for the
programmer that wrote this prime number
computing applications the key
determinant of performance is going to
be sustained CPU time that's available
for crunching his application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
