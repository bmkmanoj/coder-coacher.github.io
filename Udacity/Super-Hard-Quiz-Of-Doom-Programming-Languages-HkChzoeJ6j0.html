our last question on finite state
machines and regular languages and
regular expressions this requires quite
a bit of abstract thinking so don't feel
bad if this takes a number of tries
these questions are always some times
and never I've written out to claims and
what I want you to do is Mark this box
if the first claim is always true mark
this box if there are some times when
it's true and sometimes when it's false
and this box if it's never true so
here's the first claim suppose I have
any finite state machine a you draw it
out for me can I then make a new finite
state machine that accepts strings of
the following form for any string that's
in yours I then get another string
that's in yours and I accept their
concatenation when I glue them together
this is a little hard to get a feeling
for but let's imagine my finite state
machine a accepted ba ba ba that sort of
thing then I'd want to make a new finite
state machine that accepts ba ba ba ba
ba ba doublings of the first finite
state machine down here I have a very
similar claim but with one bit changed
if I have a finite state machine be can
I make a new finite state machine that
accepts strings of this form X
concatenated with X where X was a string
accepted by be so if you give me a
finite state machine that only
recognizes hello can I make a new finite
state machine that recognizes hello
hello I don't know why you'd say that
anyway give this some thought this may
take some extra time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
