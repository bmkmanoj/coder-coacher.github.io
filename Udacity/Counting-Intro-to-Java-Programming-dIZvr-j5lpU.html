that pattern teaches us to make an
integer variable that counts whatever it
is that we want to count you want to
have another method that increments the
counter when whatever interesting event
happens that you're counting and you'll
usually want a method that returns the
current counter value so that the user
of the class can get at it okay that's
all really abstract so let's look at a
concrete example here I have the
beginning of a car class the car has a
given number of seats that of course is
not my integer counter because that
number doesn't change then I have a
method here called add passenger
whenever that method gets called another
passenger interest a car and then I have
a method for counting the number of
passengers in this car not counting the
driver what I'd like you to do is use
this pattern and add an instance
variable for the counter which you can
call anything that you think is
appropriate and to implement the methods
that increment the counter and that
returned its current value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
