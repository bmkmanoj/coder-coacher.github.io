dynamic range that the human eye can
deal with is incredible it ranges over
14 orders of magnitude and there's
almost nothing in the real world that
works over 14 orders of magnitude right
so that means 10 to the 14 1 and 14
zeroes times from the darkest dark to
the brightest bright that you can deal
with and by the way that does not
include looking like directly at the Sun
because frankly you can't actually see
much when you look directly the Sun it's
too bright all right but you can go from
somewhere from 10 to the minus 6 to 10
to the 8th what's called candelas which
is a unit of energy per square meter
it's a measure of the amount of the flux
of the light and flux falls on a
particular area so the human eye can set
its dynamic range its set point to
anywhere from this really low this 10 to
the minus 6 10 to the minus 5 10-4 so
that'd be a range of two up to 10 to six
ten to seven another range of two it can
set it anywhere along that spectrum at
any given point in time its operating at
at least a hundred to one maybe a
thousand one maybe maybe more that
depends upon how you doing and in any
given sort of real-world scene like I
was just showing you the actual ratio of
sort of the darkest area to the
brightest area can sometimes be on the
order of a hundred thousand to one right
so you're standing there it's really
bright outside it's kind of dark in here
that difference might be under if it was
that far even you or I would have
difficulty dealing with it but it's way
better than most imaging systems now the
thing is everybody knows about your
pupil right when it's bright out the
pupil closes down when it's like you
know when it's dark the pupil opens up
that's a very small range of variation
of colleague of mine professor actually
used to say that it was like an order of
ten to a hundred variation terms of the
size exit said 10 but I think it's a
little smaller than that but how do you
do this great huge variation well it's
actually the retinas ganglion cells that
make this happen and the way it does it
is and this is sort of looking at just a
single section so remember lights coming
in this way not too important for this
thing here we have our photoreceptors
here we have our horizontal cells are
bipolar cells a Makran and then there's
ganglion cells but notice that this
thing is referred to as the surround the
center and the surround and you can
think of this as being a slice through a
circular operator okay and that circular
operator would look something like this
okay in the retina they're referred to
as center-surround receptive fields and
what that means is that and the positive
ones takes the illumination that's from
the middle and they subtract off the
illumination around the background the
negative ones do the negative in the
middle and subtract and add positive but
basically what they're doing is they're
comparing the local illumination to the
little patch of the nation to the
overall illumination so what happens
when things get much brighter well if
it's just getting brighter over the
whole thing not a lot different changes
so one part of your retina can be sort
of electrically and chemically setting
its dynamic range at one place and
another part is at another place
simultaneously so the part that's
looking at the bright window in the
church is operating at one place the
part that's up that's looking at the the
darker part it it's doing its
center-surround on a darker area but
it's looking at those relative contrasts
this plot here is just a notion of what
a center-surround field looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
