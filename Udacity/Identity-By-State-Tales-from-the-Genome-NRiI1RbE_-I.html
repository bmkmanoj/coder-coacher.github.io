we're ready to compare genomes all over
the world now for example we can take
this genome of person 1 and we can go s
and V by s and V and match them to the
snv's that we find in the genome of
person 2 for example let's say we look
at an s and V on chromosome 3 I've
marked a location of the smv here in red
in the genomes of person 1 and person 2
for example person 1 may have 2a alleles
for s MV 1 just like person - because
person 1 and person 2 are identical at
the site we give them a score of 1 now
let's take a look at a different s MV on
chromosome 7 here I've marked it on the
actual chromosome 7 for person 1 in
person - now for the second snv person 1
is homozygous for the C allele but
person 2 is heterozygous with a C and a
G allele so they would be assigned a
matching score of 0.5 right it's a half
match out of the two possible letters
that it could match only the C's match
and now let's look at this last s in V s
and V 3 here on chromosome 16 in this
case person 1 is homozygous T 4 s MV 3
but person 2 is homozygous G there's no
match at all so the matching score in
this case would be 0 so in each case we
could look at each individual s and V
and make a comparison from person to
person two and assign a score of either
1 point 5 or 0 or we could look at
multiple snv's at once and take the
average the average here we add 1 plus
0.5 plus 0 is 1 point 5 divided by 3 is
point 5 our overall matching score for
all 3 SMBs together is half this means
that between person 1 and person 2 for
these 3 s and V s half of the alleles
they have match this matching score is
also referred to as an IBS score or an
identity by state score identity by
state is just the coincidental
possession of alleles that appear
identical it's your identity by an
individual
state or SNV we can also write this
score from zero to one as a 0% to 100%
we're a hundred percent is a perfect
match 50% is a half match and 0% is no
match at all so let's take an individual
that has an allelic composition for four
snv's like this the first SMV is si si
the second one is TG the third one is AG
in the fourth one is a a which of the
following options with this individual
share an IBS score of 50% on average for
all four snv's be sure to check any and
all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
