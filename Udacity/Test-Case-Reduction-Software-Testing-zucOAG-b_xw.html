taking some large input that triggers a
failure and turning it into a small
input and it's usually the case that
many bugs can be triggered by small
inputs but on the other hand it's often
the case that for example we discover a
Firefox crash and a webpage that causes
the Firefox crash might be giant it's
probably huge we discover this bug in
the wild and statistically speaking the
pattern in this input that triggers the
Firefox crash just probably is it going
to be found in some small webpage so
what we can do is by hand figure out
what part of the input causes the test
case so one thing we can do is eliminate
part of the input and sometimes we do
this in a smart way for example we know
we might just know that some part of it
is unlikely to trigger crash or we might
just chop some of it out blindly and see
if the smaller input triggers the test
case if it doesn't then we go back to
our original test case and try again if
it does we proceed so now maybe it's
this part and if we're really lucky at
the very end of this process will end up
with a really small test case and that's
the thing we'd like to report to the
people developing the software under
test of course even if we're not
reporting bugs to someone else that is
to say we're finding bugs and software
that we wrote it's still really nice to
have a minimize test case because these
make it much easier to track down
failure so option 1 manual reduction
this has been done by people debugging
for probably about as long as computer
science has been around the second
option is really cool it's a really
really nice technique and it's called
Delta debugging and it automates this
process so if you can write a program
that can tell automatically if a
particular input triggers are failure
that is to say you load up the webpage
and Firefox and see if it crashes by
looking at the exit code that it
provides to the operating system then
Delta debugging is a framework that
takes your script and takes the test
input and automates this process in a
loop and this loop terminates when the
Delta debugger which has a bunch of
heuristics built-in for eliminating
parts of the input it terminates when
this Delta debugger can't reduce the
input anymore that's what I don't want
to do is go into this technique in a ton
of detail because the guy who developed
the Delta debugging is gonna be teaching
Udacity class sometime soon and it's
probably gonna be really interesting and
what I hope is that I've intrigued you
enough that you'll really seriously
consider taking his class it's gonna be
about debugging but I'd rather now is
show you an example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
