is to the correct answer so I said that
that was the correct answer it looks to
me like the relationships at play in
frame a and frame see are the same and
the relationships at play in frame be
and frame two are the same we saw that X
was unchanged between the two frames
just as horas y expanded just as s does
and z was deleted just as Tia's
similarly Y was above X just as s is
above are so I think it's the right
answer good David that's in fact the
correct answer to is the best choice
available here but imagine that for two
as well the match between the
representation on the left side and the
representation of the right side was
only partial just like it was when we
had five were here how then would we
make a choice between two and five David
so it sounds like so far we've been
talking about kind of an all-or-nothing
match of transformations but if we
didn't have an exact match between the
transformations we'd have to come up
with some way to evaluate how well two
transformations actually fit together so
we might say that these transformations
are 95% similar while these two are only
seventy percent similar so that would
allow us to choose one over the other
that sounds fair in fact will come
across something like this very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
