persons always decreases we cannot have
any component here with a plus sign
leave these blank and similarly the
number of recovered persons always
increases we cannot have something with
a minus sign here a certain fraction of
the infectious persons is taken per day
to the recovered compartment what worked
best is 1 over 5 days B times well the
number of infectious persons F we need
the same here with a minus sign
everybody who leaves the infectious
compartment joins d joins to be covered
compartment a similar process is in
place with E and I exposed persons
become infectious after a while the rate
should be a one over one day it seems to
be plausible latency of one day times
the number of exposed persons a certain
fraction of the exposed persons per day
gives the exposed compartment and joins
the infectious compartment that same
number that leaves here is to join here
and here we have the infection process
the number of expose infected that is
persons increases per day by five times
ten to the minus nine persons per day
times the product of the number of
infectious persons times the number of
susceptible persons so it's ch and what
we gain here we have to lose here CH
there's one thing to keep in mind though
this latency period of one day is an
average it's not a strict number similar
to this recovery period of five days
these are average numbers a small
percentage of exposed infected that is
persons will be taken pretty quickly to
the infectious state and a small
percentage will take quite a while to
get to the infectious state these times
of one day and five days are not rigid
they are averages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
