slope-intercept form the slope is for
and the y-intercept is seven this second
one is a little bit tricky it is in
slope-intercept form I know the slope is
3 and the y-intercept is actually 0 if i
add a zero on the end I don't change the
equation so this is also in the correct
form this third option is not in
slope-intercept form it's actually in
standard form it's a form are going to
learn about soon we know it's not in
slope-intercept form because we have a
coefficient in front of the Y the Y
should be sought for or it should be
alone on one side of the equal sign this
equation is also in slope-intercept form
the slope is one-third and the
y-intercept is negative 4 even though
our form has a plus sign in it i know i
can rewrite subtraction as adding the
opposite so this is definitely in
slope-intercept form this fifth option
is not in slope-intercept form I have a
coefficient of 3 in front of the Y so
the why isn't soft for and finally this
last equation is in slope-intercept form
because remember even though we don't
write it there is a one in front of the
x this is the coefficient or the slope
of our equation if you got at least half
of these right excellent work you've
really got an understanding of slope
intercept form</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
