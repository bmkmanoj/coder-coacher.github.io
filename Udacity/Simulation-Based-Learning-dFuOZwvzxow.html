students learn about from kindergarten
all the way through college that we
could teach in some really interesting
ways so for example let's imagine you
were doing a unit on the Amazonian
rainforest in biology class one way you
could teach that material is by piling
all your students onto an airplane
flying them down to the Amazonian
rainforest and letting them actually
learn about it by catching animals
dissecting them watching them in their
natural habitat and learning about them
that way it would be really interesting
and really authentic and really engaging
and completely unfeasible we can't learn
students on airplanes like that and fly
them down to a dangerous area just to
learn about how the reinforce works but
what we can do is bring them that
experience through their computers
through something like Amazon trail
which is a game or a simulation y'all
might be familiar with so what we can do
is we can use computers to construct
simulations of the kinds of environments
or experiences we want students to have
and let them engage with it that way
it's getting powerful in another number
of different ways it's very authentic it
lets them see not only the content we
want them to learn but also potentially
how people researching that content
actually work in their day to day life
let's and see what what is it like to
actually research biology down in the
Amazon or what does it like to capture
marine animals and reach and investigate
them as a marine biologist it's also
powerful because it can be very
empowering to let students explore
things on their own they kind of get to
drive their own learning and drive their
and investigation which aligns very
nicely with some other things we've
talked about so far in this class so
simulation based learning is a great way
to bring authentic and engaging learning
experiences to students through the
power of their computers so in this more
so we're going to talk about how we can
build simulations that are engaging in
authentic for the material we want to
teach the students</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
