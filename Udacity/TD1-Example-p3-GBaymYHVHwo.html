states so if there were repeated States
then oh I see okay so let's imagine that
we did outcome based updates sort of but
without then we saw repeated states and
all you're really doing is ignoring
anything oh I see okay okay how about
this Michael tell me tell me if what I'm
saying saying makes sense so sure if we
were doing out based outcome based
updates then basically you're just
looking at all the rewards that you see
the values that you kind of expected
along the way and it's exactly what you
have written down before but if we had a
repeated state then you're basically
ignoring anything you learned along the
way so yeah right right during the app
during the episode so outcome based
updates say learn nothing during the
episode so if you're if you're sequence
up there instead of being s 1 s 2 s 3 s
F had been s 1 s 2 s 3 s 1 yep then what
would have happened is I would have seen
the rewards that I saw R 1 R 2 R 3 and
then some other reward that I would see
let's call it R 1 prime or something I
don't know I would I would be pretending
as if I didn't already know something
about state 1 because I also saw it go
from state 1 to state 2 and saw a
particular reward R 1 yes I'd be
ignoring that so what this TD 1 update
lets you do is when you see s 1 again
and you sort of back up its value you've
actually captured the fact that last
time you were in s 1 you actually went
to s 2 and so our reward R 1 right
exactly so it's like the outcome-based
up updates now with extra learning we're
inside the episode learning I like it
beautiful so is that better let's say
yes excellent that makes me feel good
about myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
