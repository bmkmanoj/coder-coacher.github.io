triangle we can square the leg square
another leg and add those together to
get the hypotenuse squared but why does
this work well let's see this by
starting off with a square here's one
large square and then this small square
has a side length of a and it's a larger
square has a side length of B so we know
that the area of this square is a
squared and the area of this square is B
squared and now what I'm going to do is
break this whitespace up into four
congruent rectangles if this length is a
then we know that this length is also a
and we know if this length is B then
this length is also B if our entire
shape is a square then we know that if
this side is a plus B then this side
must also be a plus B that's how we know
that this side length is B we can use
the same reasoning to say that this side
length here is a since we know the
entire side must be a plus B so notice
that all four of these triangles are
identical they all have a leg of a a leg
of B and I have potenuse of C the four
triangles are just oriented in different
ways like for this one here's a here's B
and here's the hypotenuse across from
the 90 degree angle C so now what we're
gonna do is take this triangle and fix
it at this point we're going to rotate
the triangle around this point we're
also going to take this triangle here
and fix it at this point so we can
rotate the triangle around this point so
let's move these two triangles to a
different position we're gonna swing
this triangle up around this point and
we're gonna swing this triangle down
around this point when we rearrange the
triangles we get this new arrangement
notice that I have the same four
triangles with legs a and B and a
hypotenuse of C and the area inside here
is C squared so what do we know must be
true about this area and this new area
take some time to think and then fill in
the missing statements to this sentence
choose one of these statements to make
this sentence true and
check any of these boxes that provide
the correct reasoning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
