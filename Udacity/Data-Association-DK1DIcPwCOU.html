assumed that whatever we've measured is
associated the thing that we're going to
that we want to keep track of but in
reality there are a couple things happen
first of all there can be multiple
objects that's what this cute little
airplane thing is supposed to look like
and in fact radar is which is where the
birthplace of multi hypothesis tracking
came from had this problem right I get a
whole bunch of pings back there's a
bunch of airplanes I got to know which
pings go with which airplanes in order
to track all the different airplanes or
there can be what's known as clutter
clutter means there's a lot of stuff in
the environment that has nothing to do
with me by the way the clutter is the
basis of camouflage so when you take a
look at this rattlesnake whose contour
you can just barely see here there's all
this other stuff that has nothing to do
with it being a snake so it confuses
your visual system fortunately when the
snake starts to move if the brush is not
moving also then you can do the
Association differently but in general
clutter means that they're a bunch of
measurements that are not from the thing
I'm really interested in tracking the
problem is referred to as the data
Association problem and the trick is to
determine which measurements go with
which tracks and which measurements
should be ignored which measurements
cause you to start a new track these are
all things that you have to do when you
do tracking so there is a simple
strategy and that's what's indicated
here I've got a point and I've got the
state now I take some measurements I
might just associate I don't know the
closest measurement to my prediction so
remember when we were tracking the
contours for the condensation eyes art
and Blake algorithm right they took the
distance to the nearest strong contour
as if they knew somehow that that was
the right contour they just made that
assumption unfortunately that doesn't
always work that clutter problem in fact
one of the points of clutter is for it
to confuse something that's trying to do
that Association so those of you who
watch Tom Clancy movies or read Tom
Clancy books like I've done cetera know
that submarines will jettison these
things that spin around and make noise
and well at least I assume they do they
did in the movies they did in the book
admit the torpedoes have a data
Association problem right which thing
that's making noise or making a signal
should it decide is the real state
personally I would think seeing some you
know many thousand ton the submarine
compared to this little thing spinning
around wouldn't have been that hard but
obviously the torpedoes aren't that
smart but so it doesn't always work in
the presence of clutter there is a more
sophisticated approach to doing this and
that is you do what's called multiple
hypothesis so multiple hypothesis says
well okay I've seen two things now and
maybe it's one thing and I should
associate the real object with the left
measurement and the right one is clutter
maybe it's one thing and I should
associate the object with the right-hand
one and the left one is clutter or maybe
it's two things that is a new thing
should get created well like I said
there's this whole area called multi
hypothesis tracking where you try to
keep track of all these different things
you actually can do this using particles
all right you can do particle filtering
in a not so obvious way right each
particle is a hypothesis about the
current state so for example a particle
can say oh there are two such objects
and here's where they are or a particle
could say there is one such object and
this one is not the right one
etc so you can do that using particle
filtering and in fact that one time told
my card I said we're meeting I said you
know for a lot of situations
I found that particle filtering was just
a convenient way of doing multi
hypothesis tracking and he said
absolutely so Michael if you're out
there I remember that conversation I
think he's on the west coast having a
great time so so good for him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
