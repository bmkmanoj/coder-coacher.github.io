reversed last time we want to check and
see if element is less than or equal to
this element not the other way around
and now when we run it we find the right
answer here i'm making a significantly
bigger tree as a kind of a final test
case we start out with an empty tree but
then we add 8675309 and then also pi
3.14159265 35 and for each one of those
we insert it into t1 and assign the
result back to t1 so at the end of the
day t1 should have all of these when we
go print it out they should be in order
if our tree is working correctly we
should have gotten each one and they
should be in order let's go see if that
works ah 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 9
excellent this is a pretty good test
case for us because it's long and it
also has some duplicates a bunch of
duplicate numbers to make sure we're
handling less than or equal to or
whatnot correctly so now we have much
more confidence in our tree insertion
when we were looking to see if our tree
contains something whenever we were
looking something up in the tree we
could throw away half the tree from
consideration at each step if our target
number was less we could throw away the
right tree conceptually we just forget
about it for a while this means that
even if the tree is very large we don't
have to make very many recursive calls
that makes this tree a very efficient
data structure and in fact one way for
Python to implement things like
dictionaries is using just this sort of
tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
