this trade-off we want to balance the
errors that our regression gives us with
the number of features that are required
to get those errors we're gonna try to
maximize the quality of the model that
we're making I haven't totally defined
this yet but let me fill out this graph
and you'll get a sense for what I mean
by this let's suppose I have only one
feature in my model then I would say
that the likelihood is pretty high that
I'm under fitting my data that I have
something that's very high bias so I
would say the quality of the model might
be all right but not as good as it could
be now let's suppose that I allow a
little bit more complexity into my model
I allow to use three features and I
happen to pick three features that are
good at describing the patterns in the
data then my error is going to go down
because it's my model is now fitting my
data in a in a more precise way but it's
not too complex yet I'm only using three
features and I've checked each one of
them so the quality of my model has now
gone up so then I say well that's pretty
sweet I can improve my model just by
adding more features into it so let me
try to add in a whole bunch of features
I'm gonna jump up to 15 and I'm hoping
that that'll put the quality of my model
say somewhere up here at the maximum
value that it can have what I'll
actually find though is that I'm
starting to become susceptible to this
overfitting high variance type regime so
maybe the quality of my model has
actually become a little bit lower than
the quality of that it was at at three
features because now I'm starting to
overfit where before I was under fitting
with one I'm now overfitting with
fifteen and if I were to go all the way
out to 20 then I might even be doing
worse than if I had only one input
feature and so you could imagine that if
I sort of filled out this this graph for
all of the possible number of features
that I could get there would be some
best point where the quality of my model
is going to be maximized so a reasonable
thing to think and what we'll talk about
for the next few videos is how we can
mathematically define what this arc
might be so that we can find this
maximum point of it and this is a
process that's called regularization
it's an automatic form of feature
selection that some algorithms can do
completely on their own that they can
trade-off between the precision the good
this will fit the very low errors and
the complexity of fitting on lots and
lots of different features so let me
show you an example of how
regularization works in regressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
