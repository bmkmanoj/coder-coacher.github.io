we set y equal to 0 which is just going
to lead a 10 on the left side of the
equation and change nothing about the
right side now we need to move toward
getting X by itself you can notice that
I actually didn't use the quadratic
formula in solving this equation instead
i just undid all the operations that
have been performed on x on the right
side of the equation eventually this led
me to the answer of x equals 3 plus or
minus i times the square root of 5 now
one thing to note about the way that
I've written this answer you'll see that
I wrote I in front of the radical sign
or as we normally write in the form a
plus bi where the real coefficient of
the imaginary portion comes in front of
the number I however to avoid confusion
as to whether or not the I belongs under
the radical sign it's often written in
front of the square root sign instead
this is similar to if we had something
like three times the root of five
writing the number this way is usually
the convention rather than this way just
to make perfectly clear what doesn't
belong under the radical sign either way
though with the I as the first factor or
the I coming after the square root of
five is mathematically correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
