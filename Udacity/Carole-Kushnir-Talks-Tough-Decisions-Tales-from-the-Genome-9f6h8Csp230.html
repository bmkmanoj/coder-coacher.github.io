lot of research behind those numbers but
the numbers are still the numbers and I
imagine you know it has sort of an
anxiety effect on on an individual jeje
feel anxious or worried and what did you
end up doing did you did it change
anything for you and did you take an
action well I was very anxious and I
called my doctor he was away I call
another doctor and he was away and I
called a friend who works at one of the
local hospitals and I said this is the
situation what do you recommend i do and
she gave me the name of a doctor and it
was confirmed by the time i had that
information it was confirmed by the
doctor who had returned so i went to see
a breast oncologist and at a very large
medical center and at the same time she
scheduled me to see a genetic counselor
which is recommended when you when you
get this information it's recommended
that you speak to someone and see
someone who understands the genetics so
I did see this person and the physician
and the genetic counselor on the same
day and she was gave me a very thorough
exam and a very thorough explanation
there was no rush and I was advised to
consider strongly having my ovaries
removed and to have twice a year breast
exam and one time a year a breast MRI
and a breast mammogram and I've followed
up I've already followed up two times I
see her twice a year and I've had the
MRI and breast exam twice wow you took a
lot of action
and this was all based on the advice and
the the i should say the medical advice
of a genetic counselor and your
clinician right right and the genetic
counselor took a history of everyone in
the family mother mothers fathers
grandfathers and it was interesting to
to find out my grant my maternal
grandmother died when my mother was five
so we're talking about the 1920s and my
I was always told my grandmother died of
stomach cancer and the genetic counselor
brought up the possibility that she had
had ovarian cancer of course we wouldn't
know and this was the 1920s and that was
what we we heard that she died of
stomach cancer but it could have been
ovarian cancer in this process was it
was it just a personal decision for you
or did you include family members and
discussing it and trying to figure out
what to do as well well I'll be married
50 years in graduations 2014 I'm very
close with my husband and he and I
discussed this and it just seemed like
it was the right thing to do of course I
read a lot and I had family members who
had breast cancer and ovarian cancer and
none of them were bracha to or any
bracha for that matter so it wasn't as
if I knew anybody that had this was in
this situation if you add any advice to
tell somebody who just found out they
have a bracha wanna bracket to mutation
is there anything you think it's
important for them to know or any
particular advice or message you would
give them well if someone does inquire
and finds that I certainly think they
should get genetic counseling and
see a physician who is a specialist in
breast oncology who is aware of the
latest and greatest research we're
fortunate to live in an area where there
are wonderful hospitals and research
centers and so I strongly advise people
to take action and do what's best for
them I know age is a factor if you find
out you're in your 20s or 30s and you
haven't started a family or had children
yet what's recommended might be entirely
different than what was recommended for
me great Carol thank you so much for
being here thank you for exploring this
