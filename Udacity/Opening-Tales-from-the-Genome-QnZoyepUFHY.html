found what is it well I I found my
parents genomes really what does it say
well I've been comparing them here for a
little while but it seems pretty obvious
that I'm an equal mix of my parents they
each gave me half of their genomes so I
could have a whole genome myself but
yeah that's how it works like all the
parents passed down half the genome to
all the siblings well this is true but
it's not the same half that they give to
everybody but how does that work well
think about it it's the reason that me
and my sister don't look the same we
each got fifty percent of our DNA from
our parents but the half she got from
mom and a half i got from mom aren't the
same halves this happens because of two
really important processes called
recombination and independent assortment
in meiosis wait what in what Lauren I
think it's about time we zoomed out and
looked at the bigger picture of how
genomes and chromosomes are passed down
from parent to offspring looked at this
point we've learned about what traits
are and how our DNA codes for them both
coding and non-coding how it can create
and provide the foundation for these
traits but we still don't even know how
this material gets passed down sex uh
I'm sorry what sex that's I know that's
how you pass on genetic information I
this is true sex is the vehicle by which
the hereditary material is passed down
from generation to generation but the
question is do any of you know what's
going on at the genetic level in this
lesson we're going to learn how our
genes and chromosomes get passed down in
interesting patterns from generation to
generation making us each a unique mix
of our parents DNA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
