technically also known as pre-processing
what's the idea behind that here is what
you would normally do for an np-complete
problem as we have talked about so far
so if you are given the input for an
np-complete problem what you would do
using the techniques from the previous
units is you would fire up your search
tree to try and find an optimal solution
and of course that search tree has
exponential size so the algorithm goes
through that tree here until at a
certain point in time it says bingo I
found a solution or I found the best
possible solution the idea of
pre-processing now is similar to
something that we already saw for vertex
cover or independent set where for
certain vertices while we were
traversing the search tree or even in
advance where we could already say for
certain vertices we know what assignment
that vertex is going to have in an
optimum solution and we could make that
statement without actually going through
any branching but in polynomial time and
that is the idea of pre-processing the
idea of pre-processing is if you can
actually find certain parts of the input
we're in polynomial time of course you
can already say how they would be
handled in an optimum solution so we're
kind of nibbling away at the input here
and what that of course means is if
you're pre-processing is successful or
you especially if it's very successful
then the search tree that results from
that input is not going to be as big so
there are certain parts of the search
tree that you don't have to do because
you already have found out in the
pre-processing what that part of the
solution is going to look like so the
search tree size will decrease so we can
for example cut off this branch here
because we've already pre-processed this
and we can cut off this one here because
we also prepress that one so now let's
make this more concrete and let me give
you a concrete example and we're going
to do this for sat because SAT is a
problem where pre-processing is usually
very successful so if you were for
example to use a commercial SAT solver
then pre-processing will play a very
very important role in that I once
talked to somebody who develops those
soldiers and they basically said that
his package works ninety to ninety-five
percent through pre
processing so even for sat instances
with thousands of variables his package
can basically sold it but it can only
solve it because the pre processing
algorithms are very good so you'll
remember that SAT was the problem of
finding if a given boolean formula has a
satisfying assignment or not and I'm now
going to write down a boolean formula
for you and then we're going to do a
little quiz to make pre-processing more
concrete so the SAT formula is X 1 or X
3 or X 5 and not x1 or x2 or X 4 and so
on and so on now of course this formula
here doesn't have very many variables
it's just six variables x1 x2 x3 x4 x5
and x6 so with a little playing around
you would probably be able to figure out
if this boolean formula here has a
satisfying assignment or not of course
what we want to do now is pre processing
and that means that we want to see it
for certain variables in this boolean
formula we can figure out if they should
be set to true or false without actually
trying all possible combinations and as
I said we're going to do this as a quiz
so what I would like you to do is to
look at this boolean formula here and
then consider the variables x1 x2 x3 and
x4 and for each of those variables
determine if it's easy to see if they
should be set to true or false and by
easy I mean without actually trying
around different truth assignments for
the other variables but you can
basically immediately say for these
variables if they should be set to true
or false I'm going to give you one hint
for the solution and that is that in my
opinion and this is a bit of a
subjective question I think that for two
of these variables here it's rather easy
to see and I would like you to select
those two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
