it's my turn let's see if I can do this
right because it works better for my
brain I've transferred all the data in
the table to coordinate notation on the
right hand side of the table that just
helps me graph better personally so I'm
going to plot these points you step over
three in the negative direction on the
x-axis and down 14 you want to make sure
that the points when you graph them on
graph paper as you saw in the previous
example are as accurately placed as
possible so luckily for the scale that
we've chosen for this graph in this
equation all of these points should lie
directly on intersection points of
vertical and horizontal lines on the
graph papers that's awesome negative to
negative 11 and you can see I just made
a mistake again I forgot that we were
counting by twos in the Y direction and
I placed a point at 22 instead of 21 so
I've graphed a fair number graphs my
life so if you made a mistake doing this
not a big deal at all you just have to
make sure we correct ourselves and
lastly we have three four okay great
these look to me like they're all in a
pretty straight lines let's get a ruler
to make sure I think we're safe let's
connect them and we have a gorgeous line
that I will now draw an arrow on either
end of remember this arrow shows this
line is extending forever out in either
direction continuing its pattern for all
values of x I've also drawn an arrow on
either end of this line to show that it
extends forever out in both directions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
