some really cool stuff with
understanding the location and context
of your device
from the skills you've learned you'll be
able to write applications that know
where your phone is where it's going and
maybe even how high off the ground it is
now how about we take it to the next
level how about an app that tells you
when you enter or leave a specific
location you could use this for social
check-ins or maybe as a parent you can
use this to tell when your kids get home
I've even seen games that use this where
they virtually hide loot and when you go
to the real world location your device
knows and can react a great and easy way
to implement this is using a geofence
simply a geofence is a location in
latitude and longitude a radius around
that location and a time for which it's
active so for example you could put the
latitude and longitude of your loot
stash a radius of say 10 meters and data
that it's only active on weekends the
location API is we'll take this and when
you exit or enter that space can be used
to generate a notification it's up to
you as a developer how you handle this
does that sound exciting well I think so
so let's dive in and learn how it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
