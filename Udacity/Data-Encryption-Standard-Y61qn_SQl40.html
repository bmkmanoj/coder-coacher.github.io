scheme is based on the data encryption
standard or des it was published in 1977
and standardized in 1979 in this the key
is 64 bit which is 8 bytes but for each
byte there's one parity bit therefore
the actual value in the key is only 56
bit and the output ciphertext is again a
64 bit block here's a high level view of
deaths there are less SD runs of
operations from the original 56 bit key
16 sub keys are generated one for each
round the process of decryption with DES
is essentially the same as the
encryption process you works as follows
use the ciphertext as input to DES but
then for sub keys they're used in
reverse order that is use K 16 at the
first round of decryption use ki 15 in
the second round of decryption and so on
so forth that is for decryption we run
the same algorithm but only the keys in
reverse order
recall that diffusion is one of the
principles in encryption and it is
typically achieved through permutation
in DES permutation works by changing the
positions of the bits recall that death
has 16 rounds of operations each death
sound has the same operations and uses a
different parent key each test round
takes us the input the ciphertext
produced by the previous round and
outputs ciphertext for the next round
the input is divided into the left half
and the right half the output left half
is just the right half of the input the
right half of the output is the result
of XOR in the left half of the input and
the output of the Mangala function the
Mangler function takes as input the 32
bit input right half
expense it to for a bit then X or is it
with the 48 bit per round key then use
the S boxes to substitute B for a bit
value into a 32 bit value we can also
use algebra to represent the operations
in a death sound that is the left half
of output is the right half of the input
and the right half of the output is the
result of a sewing the left half of
input and the result of am angular
function which takes as input the right
half of the input and the program key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
