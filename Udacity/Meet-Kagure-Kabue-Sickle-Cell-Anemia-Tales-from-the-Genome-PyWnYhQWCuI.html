originally but i live in san francisco
now and i lived in an area that had a
high prevalence for sickle cell anemia
in Kenya is sickle cell anemia a common
trait I don't know how common it is but
I do know people who've had it or who
having yeah what are the symptoms of
sickle cell anemia or what was it like
for those people that you know if we've
had it it was something I didn't know
was happening until they told me
themselves with one person I always
thought to myself that she looked a
little sickly sometimes but I just
thought that maybe she had a cold but
turns out that she had or has sickle
cell anemia mm-hmm is it um is it a big
deal dumb does it seriously affect their
lives I'm not sure I'm not sure if it
does I I would imagine it does but she's
very private with it and so I don't know
how much it affected her all in all she
seemed to function normally um or you
know she would show up to class and go
through everything that we would go
through and then I think to myself oh
she's sick again mm hmm is anyone no one
in your family those ever been affected
by sickle cell anemia no no no not in my
family do you know if you're a carrier
for sickle cell anemia I do know that
and I'm not that's great does that
factor nating people's decisions about
you know children do people worry about
that having sickle cell anemia I I would
imagine that in a family where it was a
common where it had been running through
the family that they might consider it
but I've never heard of people getting
that test because with some people they
know it's not its more common in some
tribes than it is in others and so I
think in a tribe like mine where it
really happens I don't see why I don't
think they'd factor in sickle cell
anemia or whether they were carriers are
not into who they would marry do you
know of the treatment for sickle cell
anemia I mean it for people who have it
is it generally accessible I mean is it
I mean do people know about it is it
something that's able to be treated in
general for most people so in a country
like Kenya with a rural population that
may be less literate they would be less
likely to know about treatment options
than a population that was more urban or
more literate not necessarily the same
thing but more literate they would know
more and would have access to treatment
so it depends on the region as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
