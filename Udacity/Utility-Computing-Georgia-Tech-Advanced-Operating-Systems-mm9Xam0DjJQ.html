however we find that it is not just Bona
who is using the resources in the
virtual platform but there is also
Pierrot and there is also Kim and
possibly others who are also running
their own applications their own
operating system on the same shared
hardware resources why would we want to
do this well unless we are quite unlucky
the hope is that sharing hardware
resources across several different user
communities is going to result in making
the cost of ownership and maintenance of
the shared resources much cheaper the
fundamental intuition that makes sharing
hardware resources across a diverse set
of users is the fact that resource usage
is typically very bursty if we were to
draw let's take one particular resource
usage for instance memory if we were to
draw Banas memory usage over time it
might look like this and maybe Pyrrhus
need for memory over time may look like
this and Kim's like this and so on now
adding all of these dynamic needs of
different user communities we may see a
cumulative usage pattern that might look
like this now let's consider Bhalla cost
if he were to buy his own server then he
would have to buy as much as this
because that is the peak usage that he
has and probably he'll want to do more
than that just to be on the safe side
the virtual machine actually has a total
available memory that's much more than
the individual needs of any one of these
guys and each of these guys get to share
the cost of the total resources among
themselves on a big enough scale
what this would mean is that each of
these guys will have potentially access
to a lot more resources than they can
individually afford to pay for and a
fraction of the cost because both the
cost of acquiring the resource as well
as maintaining it and upgrading it and
so on is born
collectively and that in a nutshell is
the hope behind utility computing that
is promoted by data centers worldwide
and this is how Amazon Web service
Microsoft and so on
they all provide resource on a shared
basis to a wide clientele some of you
may have already seen the connection to
what we have seen in the previous
lecture yes
virtualization is the logical extension
to the idea of extensibility or
specialization of services that we've
seen in the previous lesson through the
spin and exokernel papers only now it is
applied at a much larger granularity
namely an entire operating system in
other words virtualization is
extensibility applied at the granularity
of an entire operating system as opposed
to individual services within an
operating system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
