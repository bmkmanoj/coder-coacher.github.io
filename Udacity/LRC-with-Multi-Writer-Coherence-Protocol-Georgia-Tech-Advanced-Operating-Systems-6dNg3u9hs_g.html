part of it
note that there could be multiple user
data structures present in a given page
X if that is the case the programmer
probably has different locks for
accessing different portions of the data
structures that happen to all fit within
this page X so it is conceivable that
while all of this was going on there is
another processor let's say p4 and a
thread that is running on that processor
P for God a completely different lock
let's say L 2 and it is accessing some
data structure that happens to be in the
same page X this is perfectly fine the
DSM software is not going to do anything
in terms of the diffs that it has
created with respect to the page X
because of lock acquisition l that's
completely different set of actions
compared to a different lock acquisition
say L 2 so if in fact that other thread
that is running on p4 executed in
parallel with P 1 god its locks say L 2
and modified X when Peter gets its lock
L and Eve some software is going to
bring the diffs only from the previous
users of the same lock l p4 was not
using L it was using L 2 even though it
access the same page is modifying a
different portion of that page and
therefore DSM software is going to
assume that that change made by p4 2 X s
is relevant so far as P 2 is critical
section is concerned so that's the
important thing and that is where the
multiple writer coherence protocol
semantics comes in that simultaneously
the same page could be modified by
several different threads on several
different processors and that is
perfectly fine so long as they're using
different locks so the association
between the set of changes to a page is
only two in a specific lock which is
being used to govern that critical
section
and this is the reason why this is
called a multiple writer coherence
protocol and we saw how this multiple
writer coherence protocol lives in
concert with LRC to reduce the amount of
communication that goes on in executing
critical sections of an application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
