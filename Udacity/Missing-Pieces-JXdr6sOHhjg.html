ocl to provide precise specifications
for simple for the for a simple library
information system even so there are
many more things we would need to do to
complete this exercise we haven't even
mentioned some of the other requirements
like numbers 1 3 8 10 and 11 which we
would need to specify we haven't of
course at all in this whole exercise
mentioned anything having to do with non
functional requirements along the way we
invented some auxiliary operations like
is available and is available is
actually pretty complicated itself and
we'd have to we'd have to write that out
we would have to handle some situations
implicit in the requirements such as
returning a loanable item that's
returning a book that you've checked out
paying a fine cancelling a request and
so on and we might have to consider some
new some new issues that arise during
the course of doing this for example if
one item in a title is a best-seller
need all of them be best sellers okay it
would make sense in a library if you
have some designated book as a
best-seller that all the items in that
title are a best-seller but we haven't
stated anything explicitly that would
require that we would also need to add
in some specifications for operations
for classes date and money money had to
do with paying fines although in those
situations we could presumably reuse
those specifications in other systems
that we're building likewise for the
operating system operations we also
haven't said anything about constructing
instances of loanable items and patrons
although we did construct instances of
associations and we could use similar
techniques for constructing the
instances of the other two classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
