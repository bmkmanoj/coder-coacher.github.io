reductions begin to feel a little
repetitive and it's natural to wonder
whether there is a theorem that would
capture them all indeed there is and
it's traditionally called Rice's theorem
after HG Rice's 1953 paper on the
subject this is a very powerful theorem
and it implies that we can't say
anything about a computer just based on
the language that it recognizes so far
the pattern has been that we've wanted
to show that some language L was
undecidable and this language L was
about descriptions of Turing machines
whose languages that is the set of
strings that they accept have a certain
property two things have to be true
about this language first as we've said
that the membership can only depend on
the language of the machine not about
its particular implementation by the
number of states or the tape alphabet
and so forth second is that the language
can't be trivial either including or
excluding every Turing machine we'll
assume that there's some machine m1 in
the language and another machine m2
outside the language that's the only
additional assumption we need recall
that in all our reductions we created a
machine n that either accepts nothing or
else it has some other behavior
depending on the behavior of the input
machine M similarly there are two cases
for Rice's theorem either the empty set
is in P and therefore every machine that
doesn't accept anything is in the
language L or else the empty set is not
in P similarly there are two cases for
Rice's theorem either the empty set is
in P and therefore every machine that
doesn't accept anything is in the
language L or else the empty set is not
in P and every language that doesn't
accept anything is not it now let's take
a look at the case where the empty set
is not NP first in that case we reduce
from the halting problem the reduction
looks like this and just runs M with the
empty input and if M halts then we
define n two acts just like this machine
M 1 which is in the language thus n acts
like M 1
M halts on the empty string and it loops
otherwise this is exactly what we want
in the one case the language of n is the
language of M 1 and hence n must be in
the language in the other case the
language of n is the empty string
meaning that it's not in L and a decider
for L can thus tell the difference and
tell us whether M halted on the empty
string or not now for the other case
where the empty set is in P thus every
machine that doesn't accept any string
should be in the language in this case
we just replace M 1 by M 2 in the
definition of the reduction so that n
behaves like M 2 if M halts on the empty
string this is fine but we need to
reduce from the compliment of the
halting problem that is from the set of
descriptions of Turing machines that
loop on the empty input otherwise we
would end up accepting we wanted to not
accept and vice-versa all in all then we
have proved the following theorem we'll
let L be a subset of strings
representing Turing machines having to
kink properties first if M 1 and M 2
recognize the same language that is the
same set of strings then their
descriptions are both in or out of the
language this just says that the
language only depends on the behavior of
the machine and not on its
implementation second the language can't
be trivial there must be a machine whose
description is in the language and a
machine whose description is not in the
language if these two properties hold
then the language L is undecidable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
