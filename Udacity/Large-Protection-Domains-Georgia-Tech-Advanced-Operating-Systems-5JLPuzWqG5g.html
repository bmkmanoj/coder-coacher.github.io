domain is so large that it needs all of
the hardware address space
maybe the file system code base is so
big that it needs the entire hardware
address space cannot share it with
anybody else
similarly the code base for the storage
module is so big that it may occupy the
entire Hardware address space now this
way the situation that is if the
protection domains are so large that
they pretty much occupy the entire
hardware address space and if the TLB
does not support address space tagging
then you have to do a TLB flush on a
context which if you go from this
service to this service you need to do a
TLB flush because the memory footprint
of each of these service is as big as
the hardware address space that's
available on the processor or in other
words the segment's overlap and
therefore you have to do a TLB flush
when you do a context switch the cost
that we've been talking about so far is
the explicit cost that is the cost that
is incurred for flushing the TLB at the
point of a context switch and for small
protection domains that we want to go
across we want to avoid that cost and we
can do that by packing them in the
linear address space provided by the
hardware but if the memory footprint of
the service is so big that it occupies
the hardware address space of the
architecture completely the explicit
cost we're going to incur because we
have to do a TLB flush if the TLB is not
address base tag but that explicit cost
is very insignificant compared to the
implicit cost that is going to be
incurred now what do we mean by implicit
cost we mean cache effects that is the
loss of locality going from this service
to this service that the cache is not
going to have the working set of this
service when we go from here to here
that impact is much more than the
explicit cost for example lead-k shows
that on the specific architecture in
which they implemented l3
which is a pentium architecture it had
32 entries for kernel translations and
64 entries for user translations even if
you want to flush the entire TLD all the
entries in the TLB it takes 864 cycles
to do that but the loss of locality when
a service goes from this to this in
terms of cache effects is going to be
much more significant because with a
large address space you expect that
you're doing more work in the sub system
and the implicit costs are going to
dominate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
