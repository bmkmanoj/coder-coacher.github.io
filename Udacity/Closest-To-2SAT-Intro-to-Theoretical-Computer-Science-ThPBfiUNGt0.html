this one above again it's a bit
subjective using these small examples
but otherwise it's just too complicated
for you to see and explain so my point
here is basically this if you have
decided what you're going to do with x1
x2 and x3 then the following thing
happens you've already decided what
you're going to do with x1 you've
already decided what you're going to do
with x2 and you've already decided what
you're going to do with x3 and in that
case what remains is an instance of two
set and that is solvable in polynomial
time of course this is a very simple
example so you could have already
figured it out how to solve it so
there's many different ways to solve it
but I just wanted to show you what I
mean by distance of a 3sat instance to a
to set instance because if here you
decide what to do with these values well
you have it figured out for this clause
here you have it figured out for this
one here but you have not figured it out
for that one here so in a way the above
boolean formula is closer to a
polynomial time solvable instance of sab
than the one down here but of course you
would need a really really large and
tedious boolean format to actually take
advantage of this but in fact many
professional Sat solvers or Sat solving
packages actually make use of this fact
there are a number of variants of Sat
that are known to be solvable in
polynomial time
and what these solvers do is they will
try to figure out if the boolean formula
that they are given is actually close to
one of those polynomial time solvable
instances actually I don't even know if
somebody has considered this as a
parameter for fixed parameter
tractability so they might actually be
an open research problem for you here if
you're ready to get into it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
