operators we'll start by using just
literals to demonstrate but these
operators work with variables constants
and if you're accessing struct property
values like we've seen so far first
let's add two numbers together and as
you expect five plus three is eight we
can subtract two numbers and notice if
we use subtraction between these two
numbers five and 2.5 where one is a
floating-point number we get a
floating-point result and that's because
the Swift compiler smart enough to know
the difference between subtracting two
integers here and getting an integer
result and subtracting out a
floating-point value here to compute a
floating-point result we'll go ahead and
do the same for multiplication and
division but here's something that's a
little bit interesting how come when we
divide five by three we just get the
value of one well since the Swift
compiler knows both of these literal
values are integers when it performs the
division it does not include the decimal
part instead it truncates the decimal
part and leaves you with this whole
value of one now let's see what happens
with the dreaded divide by zero case it
looks like the Swift compiler smart
enough to know that this is a divide by
zero and it can't execute this but
enough with these literals let's try
some actual variables now created these
ahead of time so I'm just going to paste
them in and we have a variable for the
value 5 3 &amp;amp; 0 and now we're trying to do
the same 5 divided by 0 or a / 0 case
but what's going on this time last time
the Swift compiler was able to detect
the divide by 0
well this time since we're using a
variable the Swift compiler cannot
automatically detect the issue instead
the playground file tries to run this
code and as you can see the execution is
interrupted because it can't execute
this and we can tell that the execution
of the playground stopped because if I
try to go a line below and do anything
we can see that it never reaches this
line it stops right here so let's just
remove this and comment this line out
there's one more operator I want to
introduce which belongs with add
subtract multiply and divide and that's
the remainder operator also called the
modulus operator
many times you'll hear it called mod for
short the mod operator allows us to
perform division and then return only
the remainder and this operator is
really useful when determining multiples
or if a numbers even or odd by the way
the modulus operator is the % and we can
see if we mod 10 by the number 2 the
remainder is 0 so we know that tens and
even number let's try this with an odd
number and in this case because the
result is 1 we know that the number is
odd but you don't just have to do even
and odd let's try an example for say
multiples of 5 we know that 5 is a
multiple of 5 but 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 or not and we
can see the remainders here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
