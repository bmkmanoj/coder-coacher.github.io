environment it is so much better than
sitting in a stuffy office all day for
the next part of this lesson you'll be
setting up your environment now the
environment here consists of all the
living things and natural processes your
development environment consists of all
the software and code that's available
to either you or the code that you're
running the first two aspects of your
environment that you need to set up are
your browser and your text editor but
before you go installing anything hold
on a second I want to clarify a few
things first one you will be using a
text editor to write code when you read
text editor you might think about a
piece of software like Microsoft Word
but our text editors for coding are
different word shows you rich text rich
text is formatted with fonts and styles
and colors etc you want to write plain
text for code this is just a set of
ASCII characters you should never ever
ever use Microsoft Word for coding the
code that you write should not be styled
it is just plain text okay and point two
sometimes you might hear the term IDE
thrown around as a place to write code
IDE stands for integrated development
environment Apple's Xcode and
Microsoft's Visual Studio are two
examples of IDE s you can think of an
IDE as a text editor on steroids besides
allowing you to write code they will
also compile it and then run your code
for you beyond that they also have a
number of other features that you
wouldn't find in a text editor
i des are incredibly useful but they
aren't really ever used for web
development because of browsers browsers
will run our code and we actually don't
have to worry about compiling anything
that's just not a thing with web
development I recommend staying away
from IDE s for the time being unless you
happen to already be familiar with one
ok it's time for you to set up your
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
