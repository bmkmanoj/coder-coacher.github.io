the Python re module there are two
functions search and match search takes
a pattern a regular expression in the
form of a string as we as we've defined
and a text and it returns true if the
pattern appears anywhere in the text
rather I should say I'm simplifying a
little bit here the Python re module
returns a more complicated result anon
not literally true but a result that
that is true and has some more data but
in our implementation we're just going
to return true or false so if the
pattern occurs anywhere in the text
return true and then match says return
true if the pattern appears at the very
start of the text to make sure we
understand what these are supposed to be
returning let's add some tests here we
had four tests each testing this regular
expression ba a star exclamation point
if we search for that within the strings
sheep said ba if should find it right
here if we search with that within this
string it shouldn't find it because the
B and the A's are there but it's not
followed by an exclamation point so that
should be false if we try to match it
against this string it's false because
it doesn't occur right at the start and
if we try to match it against this
string it's true because there is a
match right at the start now regular
expressions are complicated so I wanted
to add some more tests just to go
through we'll check for the dollar sign
we'll check for the up arrow at the
start we'll check for stars we'll check
for the question mark optional and we'll
go into more detail testing a pattern
against multiple possible words at the
end at the start in the middle check for
this dot character and if we can do all
that then we have some confidence that
our routines are working so let's get
back to the routines now if you want you
could go ahead and try to write search
and match they're complicated and you
need to understand a little bit about
the processing of regular
to get them right if you feel you're up
to it go ahead and try it now if not I'm
going to lead you through it step by
step the two seem similar so be nice to
write one in terms of each other let's
write search in terms of match although
be possible to do it the other way
around now the real distinction is
whether a pattern starts with up arrow
or not so if we're searching remember a
search tests against anywhere in the
pattern so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to check say does the pattern
start with the up arrow and the only
place that the up arrow really makes
sense is that as the first character in
the pattern if it appears elsewhere
we're going to just consider that an
error and not try to deal with it your
program can return whatever you want if
the up arrow appears in the wrong place
not right at the start of the pattern if
it does return right at the start of the
pattern then we can reduce this to a
match with some different pattern over
the same text and if it doesn't then we
can also return it to a match reduce it
to a match with some different pattern
over the text what I'd like you to do is
fill in these two patterns to say what
is a search expressed at in terms of a
match with an up arrow and without an up
arrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
