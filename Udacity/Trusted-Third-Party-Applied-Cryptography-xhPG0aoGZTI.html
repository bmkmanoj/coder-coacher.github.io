solution so we'll call this one number
zero B which is to use a trusted third
party so here's the idea that we have
some very very trustworthy place and
we'll make it green people trust things
that are green so we have this very
trusty place called trusty keys and
trusty keys has a shared secret with
each individual in the network so now if
Alice and Bob want to communicate the
protocol is Alice sends a message to
trusty keys that says she wants to
communicate with Bob so that's step one
of the protocol what trusty keys will do
is generate some new key some new secret
key and we'll call that kab because it's
for alice to communicate with Bob so in
step three trusty keys will send the new
key to both Alice and Bob and it will
send it encrypted using the key that's
already shared between those two parties
so what it sends to Bob is the
encryption using KB the shared key
between Bob and trusty keys of something
that says Alice's name concatenated with
the actual key and what gets sent to
Ellis is encrypted with ka the shared
key between Alice and trusty keys and
the named Bob along with kab at this
point both Alice and Bob know kab and
can communicate securely using kab to
encrypt messages between them so the
quiz to see if you understand third
party key distribution what could go
wrong with this protocol so the choice
is our trusty Kees can read all the
messages that happen between a and B
over their encrypted Channel trusty Keys
can impersonate any customer that shares
the key with trusty keys and some evil
parties C could tamper with messages in
step 3 to steal the key a B and set up a
different key between Alice and Bob and
then steal their traffic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
