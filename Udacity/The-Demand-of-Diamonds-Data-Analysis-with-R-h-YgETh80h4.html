market for a less expensive smaller
diamond are probably more sensitive to
price than more well-to-do buyers many
less than one carat customers would
surely never buy a diamond were not for
the social norm of presenting one when
proposing and there are fewer customers
who can afford a bigger diamond that is
one that's larger than one carat
hence we shouldn't expect the market for
bigger diamonds to be as competitive as
the one for smaller diamonds so it makes
sense of the variance as well as the
price would increase with carat size now
often the distribution of any monetary
variable like dollars will be highly
skewed in very over orders of magnitude
now this can result from path dependence
for example the rich getting richer or
multiplicative processes like year on
your inflation or some combination of
both hence it's a good idea to look into
compressing any such variable by putting
it on a log scale for more tips on when
to use the log scale and how to
transform your variables check out the
link in the instructor notes let's
examine the distribution of price again
in this next programming exercise you'll
complete the code to generate to price
histograms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
