words apart into the individual
characters for example when we have a
word like this we might want to look at
one character at a time and what we're
going to do in our sample program is to
count how many vowels this word has now
why does anyone care how many vowels the
word has when you know how many vowels
there are that gives you an issue and an
idea of how complicated the word is and
sometimes you actually have to adjust
your writing to be simpler and then it's
good to know that statistic so how do we
do such a thing we need to find out each
of the characters and then look at it
more closely over here you see how to
look at the ith character you take the
substring that goes from position I up
to but not including position I plus 1
that is a string containing a single
character and we let I vary from 0 to
the last valid index that would be the
length minus 1 notice that I starts at 0
it is less than the length that makes
means it goes up to the ring for minus 1
and it gets incremented by 1 every time
this loop that you see here with this
four header and extracting the isolator
that's what you use every time that you
want to break a word into its individual
characters now on to our specific
problem we want to count vowels the
condition that you see here checks
whether the letter is a vowel it looks a
little backwards we list all of the
vowels and we ask whether the letter is
any one of those if we have a vowel we
increment a counter the rest of the
program is simple we print the result
and also we need to declare a few
variables let's run the program we're
supposed to type in a word and we
learned that Mouse has three vowels
which doesn't surprise us actually as
the bonus fact of the day some words
have more vowels than you think it's the
French word for bird orzo and it has
five fouls out of six letters which is
hard to imitate in English</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
