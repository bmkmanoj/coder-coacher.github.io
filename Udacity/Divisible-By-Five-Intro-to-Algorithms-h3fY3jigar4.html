starting unit 2 which is gonna focus on
graphs and their growth so last time
what we talked about was an introduction
to the idea of an algorithm and how
different algorithms can let you do
different things fast or slow and
started talking a little bit about
analyzing the running time of algorithms
now for reasons that are not entirely
clear to me even though this is a course
about analyzing social networks a vast
majority of our discussion last time was
on multiplying numbers together ok there
is a reason for that it was a simple
problem that is easy for everybody to
understand and appreciate where the
algorithm choice can make a very very
big difference in the behavior of the
algorithm once it's implemented this
time we're gonna focus on tools for
analyzing growth rates so that we have a
way of counting up how long running time
is going to be that we can analyze more
easily than actually counting in detail
what every statement is going to be and
at the same time we're going to develop
a feel for the kinds of graph networks
that are really important in analyzing
social networks but before we begin
we're gonna try another little magic
trick here's a block of numbers that I
mostly randomly generated a bunch of
three-digit numbers and I want you to
figure out as quickly as you can whether
the product of all these numbers is
divisible by 5 or if it's not divisible
by 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
