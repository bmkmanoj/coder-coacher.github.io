factors of a hundred that's sum to
negative twenty we get the hundred from
multiplying 25 times for these are the
factor pairs for a positive 100 but
remember that this is positive 100 and I
have a negative 20 down here we need to
find factors of positive 100 that sum to
negative 20 this must mean that our
factor pair must contain two negative
numbers so negative 10 and negative 10
must be the answers here they multiply
to give us positive 100 and they sum to
negative 20 but before I go to do this
step I should have asked myself first is
there a GCF here well to doesn't go into
every number because this one's not even
they don't all share an X and there's no
other common factors for 4 20 and 25
besides one so i can continue factoring
as usual we can factor out 5 x from the
first two terms and a negative 2 from
the second two terms completing my
factoring by grouping I have 5x minus 2
times 5x minus 2 since this factor is
repeated I can simply write it with a
square here's my complete factored form
some of you might have taken a shortcut
you might have recognized this as a
special pattern our first term and our
last term are perfect squares so this
fits our perfect square trinomial
pattern we can just write our answer as
5x minus 2 squared the a is 5x and the B
is too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
