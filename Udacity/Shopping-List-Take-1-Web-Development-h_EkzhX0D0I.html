this into a mini shopping list
application okay we're gonna add a bunch
of code here that I'll walk you through
as I go okay first thing we do is
replace this input type hidden' line
with a percent s and if you recall
percent s is the Python string
formatting character I'm give you a
quick example of that I'm in Python real
quick if we have a string you know
hello percent s and I say percent Steve
it substitutes the string following the
percent sign into the percent s in the
string so if I were to say greeting
equals hello
percent s and I can say greeting Udacity
it substitutes that string in so anyway
just kind of basic Python just want to
make sure you understand that because
I'm gonna abuse it
in this lesson okay so I replace input
with percent s I'm going to add a couple
more templates here and then explain
things as I go okay and now I'm gonna
add a couple more strings HTML strings
and I'll explain them as I go what I'm
trying to do here is make a big mess for
use that will clean up using templates
later okay again I'm making I'm using
another triple quoted string so I can
enter HTML I'm going to make my input
type equals hidden name equals food
again and value equals percent s because
I'm gonna substitute more values in here
I'm gonna make one final string that
will represent a shopping list a couple
blank lines a little title and then an
unordered list
remember the UL tag makes an unordered
list I'm gonna use % s to represent our
contents inside there and then I'm going
to close my unordered list tag now
you'll notice I'm not really indenting
things and we're not getting any nice
syntax highlighting that's because I'm
editing strings in Python it's not an
ideal way to go but it's what we're
doing for now okay now let's update our
main page handler to do more than just
print out the form HTML well actually
let's take a look at what happens if I
just print out this HTML as it is okay
we're back in our browser and I've
reloaded the page and
you can see there's this big ugly
percent s in the middle of our form
remember this is in the HTML this is
where our hidden element used to be if I
were to look at the source for this page
you can see it right here in the browser
that ugly percent s so anyway let's go
back to updating our code first I'm
gonna do is build up a string called
output it's going to be it's going to
start off as our form HTML and this is
what we're gonna return to the user so
I'll go ahead and and update this to
return output okay and now remember our
form HTML has a percentage variable in
it so I'm gonna make a holding place for
the value I'm gonna put in there and I'm
gonna call that hidden HTML and that
will refer to that hold the content that
we're gonna sub into there that'll be
where our hidden inputs go okay now this
line here gets all of the get parameters
or post parameters for that matter
called food get all basically means in
an app engine basically says if there is
multiple parameters with the same name
get all of them and put them in a list
so items will be a list of all the food
parameters that are in the URL okay now
we're going to loop over all each of
those items so the first thing we're
gonna do is we're going to add our
hidden HTML line okay and actually I
have a little bug here I'm going to
replace I'm gonna rename hidden HTML to
be output hidden I'm gonna prefix all of
my strings that are holding output HTML
with the word output and because I
region aliy called a hidden HTML but
we're already using that up here to
refer to this little HTML string for a
hidden input so for each item in items
add to the string hidden HTML
substituting the food name
so basically output hidden will be a
bunch of input type hidden' x' where the
value is the food from the URL okay I'm
going to add another thing in here we
call the output items and also for each
item in items we're gonna append another
little bit of HTML and you can see I
actually I didn't create item HTML let's
add that real quick up here after our
hidden HTML and this will be a list item
that goes inside the shopping list HTML
so we're going to create up a add up a
bunch of those so we've got output
hidden
we'll be a bunch of hidden inputs and
output items will be a bunch of list
elements okay now we're going to use our
shopping list HTML equals shopping list
HTML substituting in our items and then
our output and then to the end of our
output we're gonna add our shopping list
and we will only want to add things to
our shopping list if there were actually
items in the response so the response is
empty none of this can work so let's
make sure we do this properly so I
indented everything as you can tell this
is getting somewhat hard to read that's
kind of a point and finally we're going
to take our overall output and
substitute in the hidden string that
we've been building up here now when all
of this is said and done this is going
to give us a basic shopping list
functionality which I'll demo now and
then we'll walk through the actual code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
