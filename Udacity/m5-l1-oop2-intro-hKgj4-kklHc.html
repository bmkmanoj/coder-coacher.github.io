dog can bark and wag its tail but it's
more than just that what if your objects
were your customers your customers have
public actions the private thoughts
they've rich histories based on who and
where they came from and when something
goes wrong they let you know objects are
no different in this lesson you'll keep
exploring more features of objects in
Ruby you look at four aspects in
particular you'll examine what an
object's public and private interfaces
are and learn more about how they can
interact with themselves and with other
objects you learn how class methods and
class variables can help add even more
powerful features to your applications
you'll discover how inheritance allows
classes too well inherited
characteristics from other classes
saving you tons of code in the long run
and lastly you'll learn how to make your
objects throughout descriptive and
meaningful errors and exceptions
something's going to deal with errors in
your programs might as well make them
helpful errors let's dive right in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
