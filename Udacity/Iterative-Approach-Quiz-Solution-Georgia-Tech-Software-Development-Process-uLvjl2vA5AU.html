I don't think that the fact of keeping
developers busy is really one of the
highlights or the main benefits of
iterative approaches developers are
normally pretty busy without any need
for additional help so I will just not
mark this one the second one conversely
is definitely one of the advantages of
iterative approaches so the fact that
iterative approaches give developers
that early feedback is a great advantage
which has in turn additional advantages
for example it increases the project
tempo so it keeps the developers not
busy but more focused it's easier to be
focused when you have a short term of
deadline or a short term goal rather
than a release that is planned in six
months or even later another advantage
of this early feedback is the fact that
developers are rewarded for their
efforts so there is sort of an immediate
rewards because you can see the results
of your effort instead of having to wait
a long time to see such results and last
but not least the fact of getting early
feedback also minimizes the risks of
developing the wrong system so why is
that well because getting early feedback
will also allow us to find out whether
we're going in the wrong direction early
in the development process rather than
at the end and therefore will minimize
this risk going back to the previous
question yeah I don't think that you
know doing the same thing over and over
is a great advantage and in fact
iterative approaches do not do the same
thing over and over so they keep
iterating but they keep augmenting the
amount of functionality in the system
they don't just repeat the same thing as
for improving planning actually
improving planning is not really a
strength of these approaches because
sometimes the number of iterations is
hard to predict so it's hard to do an
actual planning when you're using an
iterative approach so finally our
utility approach is good for
accommodating evolving requirements
most definitely first iterative
approaches and in particular the one
we're discussing consider requirements
incrementally so they can better
incorporate new requirements so if there
are new requirements it's easier to
accommodate them using an intuitive
approach second these approaches realize
a few requirements at a time starting
from the most risky ones as we said so
any problem with those risky
requirements will be discovered early
and suitable course corrections could be
taken so in case you still have doubts
about iterative approaches it might be
worth that to go back at the mini course
number one lesson number two to discuss
the life cycle models because we talked
about
tentative approaches and their
advantages and their characteristics
there in some detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
