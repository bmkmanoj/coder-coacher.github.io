page and let's test out all that new
code we just wrote okay so I added steak
and you can see it reload of the page
food equals steak in the URL and it
added our shopping list so now you can
see what we've been working towards this
whole time let's take a quick view of
the source code of this file so you can
see our form here and you can see we
stuck in the input hidden value equals
steak and then on our shopping list that
we penned it to the end of that output
HTML you see a list item for steak let's
go ahead and try adding another food
eggs
let me see what's on my mind this
morning okay so you can see we have both
our elements in the URL that's because
when this page loaded last time it had
steak as a hidden input remember and
when we submit the form the hidden input
stays preserved let's look at the source
for this version of the page now and you
can see we have two inputs two hidden
inputs one for eggs and one for steak
and then we can see we have the list
items we've been adding notice that the
whitespace here is kind of messed up
HTML always puts list items unless you
style it otherwise on their own line so
independent of whatever whitespace is in
our source HTML will display let's let's
try just for fun adding something to the
URL here how about food equals pizza and
when I hit enter we get pizza added to
our list let's go through this code one
last time so you can understand fully
what just happened we've got our form
HTML runners the basic form and inside
that form that's what we're adding in
the hidden inputs if I were to view the
source of a version of this page you
would see that we have three hidden
inputs when we have three items food
items in the URL the HTML that describes
those hidden inputs is here now in our
code we said that if there were any
items in the URL any items that come
from the food parameter that will do all
this string formatting here where we
basically build up a list of the hidden
items and then build up a list of the
list items these bits of HTML here and
then concatenate everything together
putting the items into the list and then
putting that whole shopping list at the
end of our output and then finally we
substitute our
hidden HTML that we've been building up
into our output string and we write the
whole thing back to the user so the
functionality we get here is kind of a
neat side effect of how storing data and
the URL allows us to build this fake
shopping list functionality but it was a
little bit of a pain to write ok and now
it's time for one of those quizzes where
you probably already know all of the
answers so what is wrong with that
previous solution that we just went
through check all that apply
one it's a pain to change next we don't
get any syntax highlighting in our HTML
our code is ugly and it's very
error-prone and I left out of the video
the part where I was swearing trying to
get all of this working for you ok check
all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
