are available in an operating system and
the pros and cons the timer that many of
you may be familiar with is a periodic
timer that is standard in in most UNIX
operating systems and the periodic timer
the pro is periodicity that's the pro of
a periodic timer that the operating
system is not going to be interrupted
willy-nilly but it is going to be
interrupted at regular periods but the
con is the event recognition latency
because the event may have happened at a
particular point in time but because of
the granularity of the periodic timer
the event is actually recognized at a
much later point in real time and that's
the con for periodic timer and the
maximum timer latency is equal to the
period itself so for instance if the
event happened just after a periodic
interrupt then the event will have to be
delivered by the next periodic interrupt
so the worst case latency is going to be
the periodicity of the periodic timer
itself the other extreme to periodic
timer is what are called one-shot timers
and what one-shot timers are they are
exact timers that is you can program
these timers to go off at exactly the
point at which you want the interrupt to
be delivered to the processor so the Pro
is a timeliness of the one-shot timer
and secondly there is also fielding
these
one-shot timers as and when they occur
that's an extra overhead that the
operating system has to deal with if we
are concerned with the interrupts
overhead one extreme position to take is
to get rid of timer interrupts
altogether and simply use soft timers
that is there is no timer interrupt but
the operating system is going to poll at
strategic times to see if there is an
external event what would be strategic
times typically any application is going
to make system calls and when a system
call gets you into the kernel at the
point the colonel can see if there are
any events that need attention at that
point of time and that is a polling
method but the downside of the polling
method is the fact that there is latency
associated with that and there is also
the fact that you have to pull all the
events to see if any of them have
expired and there is an overhead
associated with that these are the two
cons for a soft timer but the pro is the
fact that you have reduced overhead for
soft timers since there are no timer
interrupts per se but the kernel is
using strategic points during its
execution such as system calls or other
external interrupts for instance a
network packet arrival or something like
that as a trigger for looking at the
timer data structures to see if any of
the events may have expired at that
point of time firm timer is a new
mechanism that is proposed in TS Linux
and as we will see shortly it combines
the advantages of all the three timers
that I just mentioned the periodic timer
the one-shot timer and the soft timer
essentially what firm timer is trying to
do is take the pros of all of these
types of timers in its implementation so
that it can avoid the cons associated
with each one of these individual
choices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
