really awesome crowd loving these chairs
I think these are like some sort of
space-age the panels in 2027 and I feel
like we are definitely in 2027 sitting
in these chairs that to me is
automatically the future but I wanted to
start off this panel before we go to our
experts with getting an idea of what you
all think 2027 is going to look like and
we've got some fantastic students in the
crowd some folks who are coming from
industry who are both sort of fresh out
of college and and you know from many
other places as well but I wanted to
just get two or three thoughts so if you
could just shout it out if anybody has
any thoughts on what 2027 might look
like hands hands hands yes genetically
engineered babies okay who else who can
top that come on somebody can food
what's gonna happen to food what oh
you're asking what's gonna happen to
food oh I see oh you're just hungry okay
okay I got it all right all right all
right yet last one colonies on Mars Wow
ten years that's ambitious
got to get you an Elon Musk paired up or
something very soon but yeah I mean I
think it's it's really interesting how
many differing opinions there are on
what the future might hold and we look
back in science fiction we look at the
folks who are who dare to dream who dare
to create companies here in Silicon
Valley to prepare for the future and you
see a lot of different realities and a
lot of different concerns related to
those and I think it's important to
discuss this through a couple of
different lenses so I want to start off
the panel by talking about sort of today
and how today will ultimately shape the
future and then build that conversation
around the industries that will be
disrupted and then ultimately conclude
with a conversation about education
which is why you're all here today so
without further ado let's start off with
the first topic which is just what is
the future or what is the present and
how is the present going to impact the
future so I don't know if you want to
start ashwin if you have any thoughts on
that sure I think from what's happening
in the
present that's most exciting to me is
that AI is getting liberated is it's
coming out of the companies and and and
the research labs and getting into the
hands of everyone here of consumers
think think back to the last day I you
interactive that you personally
interacted with wait probably wasn't
that long ago and it's probably happens
for many of you on a daily basis so I
think the fact that AI is starting to
enter daily lives is exciting and it's
it paves the way to the future of much
more intelligent devices and
environments that we live in so you're
bullish on AI and and Steven I mean do
you do you feel the same way you guys
are all everybody on the panel for your
background is coming from an AI
perspective so we'll probably get a lot
of bias there but I'm curious if you
feel the same way it's not that's not
bias it's just observations reality is
reality yeah
and and I agree with with Ashe but it's
it's not just the interactions with the
voice-activated agents that we think of
as sort of the popular science and
science fiction versions of an AI it's
the interactions that we have everyday
with systems that maybe have their
backends even powered by artificial
intelligence you know machine learning
natural language processing computer
vision I mean we see this in in all
kinds of professions where there's
massive amounts of data to be dealt with
and the role that AI is playing in
helping professionals in healthcare and
you know when financial services and all
these different entities kind of make
sense of the avalanche of data that
they're faced with today so that's
that's already happening and I think I'm
you know the popularization of AI in
terms of voice-activated agents is just
making people more familiar with the
access that they're having that kinds of
technology interesting and rana i want
to touch on not just how AI is going to
impact us in the future but how or yeah
not only how we impact AI but how AI is
going to impact us in the future as well
so can you maybe sort of touch on the
dichotomy there yes our kind of
perspective on AI is that it's really
transforming our relationship with both
technology and with each other as human
beings so we focus on artificial
emotional intelligence and it's this
idea that our devices and our
technologies are going to in the you
know what's happening now but very soon
in the future
are gonna have social and emotional
skills and when that happens you can
imagine you know combinations of human
and robot teams that work together or
even human and chatbot teams that work
together and I think that's gonna put a
lot of pressure on on these AI systems
but I think it's going to also require
humans to adapt in ways that we haven't
really thought through in terms of how
do you become an effective team player
when you have a hybrid human machine
team well so I think the most
interesting thing about that is what is
the human with respect to the machine or
vice versa right and as we start to
question these long-held beliefs about
what is an artisan for example or what
is the value of a human made good versus
that of a machine how do you see that
playing out in the next decade I mean I
think there's a lot of things we need to
think through our out around that
relationship things like trust and
rapport so if you're going to delegate
you know a job or a task or even even
some part of your life to a personal
assistant I think there needs to be this
reciprocal trust and understanding and I
think it's we're very early in in the
research and the understanding of how do
you represent empathy how do you
represent and model rapport using things
like machine learning and computer
vision and speech recognition
interesting and so when you think about
what this is going to actually do to
industry and how this is going to
disrupt very specific companies that
exist now and that we look to now as
being the leaders of our of our very
industrialized economy you know I I have
an interesting list here of both the top
sectors for employment and also the top
sectors that contribute to GDP and I
think it's interesting to sort of look
at the dichotomy there I mean you see
things for employment like retail and
food services and local education and
then on the GDP contribution side you
see you know real estate and finance and
healthcare and insurance and a lot of
you know very different careers and so
you know both of you coming from a you
know a heavy industry perspective of
both Amazon and IBM respectively you
know how do you look at those numbers
and what does that really mean for the
future of companies companies like yours
and I guess we can start with Ashlyn I
think what's going to happen is that
with the kinds of technology that Rana
talked about we have you know you
mentioned artisans we're going to
democratize a lot of expertise right now
that let
lives in these companies and lives in
the hands of these people who are
experts at the fields so with the help
of AI with the help of Technology and
all of us are going to be able to
perform some of these kinds of
high-level expert tasks for ourselves
and that that then frees us as humans to
have the time to then take care of some
of the things on your first list things
like education things where you do need
human contact we're not gonna want our
kids sitting in front of a robot nanny
anytime soon right
but we need to free up people from from
some of the things that machine's can do
for us so that we can spend time on
humans human facing things do you think
human face saying is more in line with
the items that I listed that were
highest employment or most in line with
things that contribute most to GDP this
this in in both of those categories
there are human human facing aspects so
but I think the list you you had for
employer for highest employment right I
think those are those have a higher
percentage of human facing some needs
then the other list so that's
interesting and Steven you know when you
think about something like Watson or
sort of IBM in general with respect to
all of these industries that will soon
be disrupted how do you see that playing
out do you feel similarly that it's
going to be you know humans and machines
in all of those fields or do you
prioritize some of them sort of over
others yeah so I mean obviously IBM
prioritized to some of the larger
industries for ourselves so we look at
financial services we look at healthcare
but in in almost all cases actually in
all cases we really think of when we say
AI we actually usually mean augmented
intelligence rather than artificial
intelligence because we talk about
scaling human cognition and scaling
expertise so we think of a physician
working hand in hand with a Watson
powered or AI powered
assistant that can help them do the
research necessary to identify the right
diagnosis and treatment plan much more
quickly than they would have so that
rather than spending three minutes with
the patient and 40 minutes and research
maybe they can spend three minutes and
research and 40 minutes on the patient
and and really shift the balance of how
they spend their time and do what they
enter the medical profession to do which
is to to care for people same thing when
we're talking about financial services
No can we have your you know your
investment advisor kind of supercharged
the way that they do research and make
it easier for them to spend more time
with you and then scaling I think the
the long tail of this is is really
exciting when you go to places for
example that don't have access so the
kinds of healthcare that maybe you'll
find it some of the I'll just pick you
know MD Anderson or the Cleveland Clinic
or any of those major healthcare
facilities what if we could bottle some
of that expertise and ship it overseas
to places where the ratio between doctor
and patient is not as favorable as it is
here perhaps in the Bay Area and really
make it possible for people to get
better access to these products and
services so I think it's really all
about scaling and augmenting human
intelligence seeing that partnership
play out in in in advantageous ways to
all of us and then you know really
making that expertise available in
places where it's previously not been
available and so Rhonda you have a
really unique perspective here having
you know you work at a start-up that you
lead a startup effort and so when you
look at the sort of greater ecosystem in
Silicon Valley and and in other cities
you know across the world that are that
have strong developing entrepreneurial
ecosystems how do you see the
relationship between these larger
companies that are in some ways leading
the charge of you know Watson as a
platform or Alexa as a platform and do
you think that ultimately influences the
work that either you do or that other
startups that you are connected with do
yeah that's a great question we spend a
lot of time as a start-up talking about
how do we plug into these partners you
know these larger ecosystems and in fact
we talked about this over dinner last
night like the way we see it we are like
the emotion brain of many of these other
you know AI systems like Watson or Alexa
and so in an ideal world we're
integrated into these platforms and that
opens our technology up to a lot so in
the future you you see you see large
companies sort of leading that charge
and that a lot of what we'll see in 2027
will be the expansion of those platforms
and then the growth of startups around
them absolutely because a lot of it is
about reach right and and both reach in
terms of impacting people's lives but
also the ability to collect data that
improves the training and the machine
learning kind of the drives that all of
these is there any downside to that I
mean do you when you have conversations
with venture capitalists or with other
founders do
like folks shy away from certain
applications that maybe don't have as
much ecosystem support or might not be a
strategic for a potential acquisition
later on I don't know I mean I we
generally we prioritize some verticals
that are larger than others larger in
terms of reach but also potential impact
but but I also I also think part of it
is making the technology available so
that other developers and smaller
industries or niche markets can can
access our technology and integrate it
I'll give you an example so in autism
you know individuals on the autism
spectrum really struggle with nonverbal
behavior and that's not a market that
efectivo would go after is our main kind
of market but we have our technology
available as SDKs and api's so you know
we're partnered with a company called
brain power they're all about autism
that's their primary market but we've
enabled them to integrate our technology
without having to you know hire their
own machine learning team and build that
in-house that's an example where that
kind of ecosystem and opening up the
technology to other partners is really
critical and I know I mean Watson
obviously is awesome and doing that yeah
it's a lot of responsibility for you all
leading leading the charge at these
large companies you know with respect to
that do you do you feel that do you feel
sort of this this push to not just do
necessarily what the largest market is
but to also build API is an SDKs to
address problems sort of like you
mentioned in education that you know
might not be as explicitly profitable in
the short run but clearly need a lot of
attention and and room to innovate yeah
we do so you know Amazon is is sort of a
unique company and at the scale in that
a primary market our consumers are
average regular people right so so we
are not looking at particular niche
applications of particular industries
where there's a lot of money we are
looking at what people want and to the
extent that people want education we
bought an education division right to
people so we're going we're really
trying to address the needs of millions
and billions of people directly and so
that I think that gives us a these kinds
of technologies enable us to
to scale what we do to for these folks
and do it much much faster and much much
more cheaply and so Stephen when you
think about that right and you think
about sort of the mindset that you have
to have to address those problems do you
have any particular industries from the
past let's say maybe a grandparent or
somebody else in your family lineage
that worked a job that no longer exists
that you would sort of love to see come
back or is there a particular job that
you just want to create I mean what if
you could create sort of any ideal job
is this like a food tester meets AI
combo like how do you how do you how do
you sort of explain that so I don't
really think of it in terms of you know
jobs from the past I think if you look
in the past a lot of jobs that have been
destroyed I don't think anybody really
wishes that they were you know you know
working the fields and the way that we
hadn't worked the fields before there
was you know you know farming automation
for example so I think many of the jobs
that have gone away have been replaced
by higher value jobs and it's helped
society itself to GDP it's on people
what what the way IBM looks at this
though is that you know very similar
there are certainly industries that work
in a tackle that are going to really
align to you know to our business needs
but but the real goal is to enable
universe of developers and educators to
build solutions on top of the platform
and that's probably going to lead to the
creation of of jobs in areas that that
I'm not even you know were your honor
for 2027 so I'm gonna make you come up
with at least two or three things that
you think could could come about from
that a personality coach for an AI okay
I don't know if you think we're gonna
need a personality coach I think that's
something so who's gonna teach the AI
manners you know anybody else Ryan
school for an AI
anybody else got a good one anybody else
the audience you guys have good ones
somebody somebody you could literally
shout out anything and it would talent
we're talking about 2027 you could say
AI walking eating a popsicle selling out
of a hot dog truck and it probably
wouldn't be that outrageous so yes what
ah what are we optimizing on mind help
so optimizing ah yes yes yes did you
have something
oh no assignment I meant like like sort
of like specifically like like jobs that
you might see in the future not nothing
of some kind of compliance things or
regulatory anything yeah yeah yeah yeah
well to be a whole new class of of AI
operators right like you know you now
have medical device operators I think
there's gonna be AI operators they need
to ensure that the ai ai systems are you
know complying to whatever regulations
we have I think there's gonna be a lot
of questions around morality and
autonomy like what can an AI system do
and what can't it do and what if it goes
wrong there needs to be somebody who can
interject and reset it or retrain it so
I think there's a whole new class of
jobs I think in fact when we were more
seriously than the than the Charm School
for AI when we talk about you know
what's the what are the employment
opportunities you know we always talk
about blue-collar jobs and white-collar
jobs you know our CEO Ginni Rometty
talks about new collar jobs that are
gonna be creating and it goes beyond
just the sort of standard STEM types of
roles we all know there's gonna be a
shortage of computer scientists you know
in five to ten years if not there's not
already one but I think there's a whole
category of jobs you know data curators
who's gonna you know monitor the
training data to make sure they're not
providing biased training data to these
to these AIS you know who's gonna you
know make sure that they're behaving in
a moral and ethical way as you said you
know compliance to variety of
regulations acting in a way that people
like so the Charm School free I idea I
think it's actually not that far-fetched
there can be people whose whose job it
is to monitor the interactions and
customer service for the AI to make sure
that it's having the delight that that
we expect in customer service sector so
I think there's a whole kind of swath of
jobs that are gonna be created around
you know maintaining monitoring training
curating and and and basically the care
and feeding of these systems over time
yeah I think that was a great segue
actually perfect because the end I
wanted to make sure we save some time to
talk about education and how we prepare
to get to those points and I think some
of thats related to
how we teach and what curriculum looks
like and some of that steep related to
regulation and sort of what's gonna
happen in that space to enable sort of
new forms of of teaching and learning
and preparedness and you all are at a
nude acity conference today there's a
lot of conversation to be had around
sort of what is the fate of the
undergraduate institution or what is the
fate of k-12 education and in countries
around the world so Ashwin when you
think about a question like that there's
a lot of weight to that but you know do
you think that these institutions can
keep up with the innovation that's
happening in education and and should
they so I think they have to get with
the times right like any other large
institution in whether it's in in any
industry things are changing and and
certainly the students see a testament
to that and people people want you know
people want to be educated and not just
in new ways but in in new domains and in
with new kinds of skill sets so you know
my prediction for AI for example is I
think the future via education isn't
actually about AI it's about people it's
going to be about how AI is interact
with people we are going to we are going
to teach design customer experience or
user experience we are going to desert
teach psychology and and personalities
and all these kinds of things that's
going to be important and in an AI
degree do you think stem is overvalued
I think stem is absolutely essential but
I think that you know I love the book
danping spoke a whole new mind when he
talks about you know we don't want to
folk overly index on left brain skills
only I think the right brain skills are
going to get increasingly important
gotcha gotcha and when you think about
sort of a skills based education versus
something that's a little bit more
holistic you know I don't know if you or
or Steven if you have any sort of
thoughts around that and the value of a
nano degree in today's economy and and
will a nano degree be more or less
valuable in 2027 that's interesting I'm
actually a proponent of of both
broad-based education as well as
targeted skills based education and I
think they do very different things
right so I think you know especially for
people that are looking for second
careers or looking to augment their
skills I think this kind of skill based
education these Dan of degrees are
absolutely essential and it's a
brilliant brilliant model not just
saying that because you know Udacity
asked me to come here I think though
that the
based education is going to be I'm still
an essential part of you know of our of
our culture now going forward I think
there's going to be an interesting
tension and those tensions usually are
healthy to see how the two kind of
rested with one another I think you'll
see major educational institutions
offering things that are like nano
degrees and perhaps you know Udacity
offering more broad-based education over
time as well and these things are going
to kind of as I said wrestle but just to
get back to your earlier comment there's
no way to say that stem is overvalued
I mean it's cliched but it is absolutely
absolutely essential to the future the
most important thing though is going to
be to figure out how to take sort of the
hard sciences and math and marry them
with you know psychology design human
factors because at the end of the day
it's not just how does the box works
internally but it has it interact with
people and be part of that collaboration
between given a machine and this
together we're gonna do more than either
one of us you do a part fantastic and
just to wrap up here in the last couple
of seconds I want each of you to
complete the sentence in 2027 so
starting with Rana in 2027 social and
emotional technologies are going to
become ubiquitous and that's gonna
transform how we you know quantify and
diagnose mental health how we
democratize education and I think we
won't even remember what it was like
when our devices didn't read our
emotions like we're in social I hope so
in 2027 we will look back at our
predictions and laugh it's always the
risk of these things but you're not
gonna let me off the hook I'm not even
gonna try in 2027 every interesting
decision that we make will be informed
and assisted by an artificially
intelligent system or an Augmented
intelligent system again thank you so in
2027
I think AI will cease to be a thing
it'll be ubiquitous and invisible it'll
be in everything and will cease to sort
of will cease to focus on it as this
special entity and just take it as a
part of life just like we do with say
electric motors nowadays we have dozens
of them at home and we never even think
about them alright well thank you so
much really appreciate it all of your
insights and okay
now it's up to all you guys to create
those things and also the Mars that we
talked about before the panel started
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
