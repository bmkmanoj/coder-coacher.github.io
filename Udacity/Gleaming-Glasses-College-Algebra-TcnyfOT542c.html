going to talk about one of the ways that
most people use math really frequently
and that is with money now even though
these dollar bills came out of my pocket
we're not going to talk about my
personal financial situation instead
we're going to talk about the financial
situation of a pretend startup called
gleaming glasses now this story may not
be entirely fact-based but the same
principles in the same math that we'll
talk about in regards to gleaming
glasses apply to businesses in the real
world to my friend grant kept getting
tired of having to clean his glasses it
was really tedious and frustrating he'd
have to take his glasses off of his face
to clean them which means that he could
never really see how clean he was
getting them in the first place one day
while he was in the car grant had an
epiphany
if windshield wipers could clean his
windshield so well why not just make
windshield wipers for glasses but grant
had a problem he didn't have very much
money so grant decided that he would
pitch his idea to a venture capital firm
basically a venture capitalist is a
person who invests money in brand-new
companies that don't have enough money
on their own to do what they want to do
grants glasses wipers idea was so
awesome but he received three million
dollars from a venture capital firm now
what matters isn't just how much money
grant got initially from his funders
though what he really cares about at any
given time is how much money he has left
over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
