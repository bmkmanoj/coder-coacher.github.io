code almost purely from scratch using a
few internal libraries like HTTP based
server and external libraries like SQL
alchemy creating a website from scratch
really shows that you have a good grasp
of underlying programming concepts and
are able to utilize the power of Python
but as we make our website more and more
complex the code becomes repetitive and
difficult to maintain frameworks are
collections of code that simplify the
web development process they take care
of repetitive tasks and allow us to
focus on the more unique features of our
project at the moment some of the most
popular frameworks out there are Ruby on
Rails dotnet and Django but if we take a
look at this Wikipedia article we see
that there are hundreds of frameworks
developers have created to code web
applications more efficiently frameworks
may rise and fall in popularity but the
same underlying concepts for developing
web pages applies for all of these
technologies think of a framework as a
box of prepared cake mix we could make a
cake using all these items from scratch
and would probably have a better
understanding of how to make cakes but
if we have several cakes to make in a
short period of time finding a good cake
mix simplifies the preparation process
and helps us focus on other things like
frosting in lesson two you built a
website with the raw ingredients of web
development now it's time to see how we
can use frameworks to improve our
development process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
