regular expression to have the same
language they have to have exactly the
same set of strings that they accept so
let's go try some of those out in this
particular reg ex regular expression a
is in the accepted set of strings I need
an a but I could have zero bees and zero
sees however this finite state machine
does not allow us to accept on a single
a so there's a string in here that's not
up there so this is not part of the
answer how about this one up here we can
see that the string a be nothing is in
the language of this finite state
machine but it's not in the language of
this regular expression this regular
expression requires at least one see
there are no seas up here so this is
also a bad call let's take a look at the
last one in a bit of a leading ordering
choice this regular expression uses
disjunction and one possible choice here
is a followed by nothing followed by
nothing so a is in the language of this
regular expression but we've already
seen that a is not accepted by this
finite state machine so this one is not
quite correct however this one is now
this takes a little bit of reasoning we
can certainly start with an A and then
we have at least one B and possibly more
so this looks a lot like a b-plus over
here we don't have the a we just have a
be followed by possibly more bees so
this is a lot like B plus so I've got
two branches one that's a b-plus and one
that's just be plus that's an optional a
followed by B plus after that point we
have as many ceases we want but possibly
zero that's C star so yeah this matches
number three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
