potentially a large number of measurable
features but maybe a small number of
underlying latent features that contain
most of the information my question is
what we'll be exploring in this lesson
what's the best way to condense our four
features to two so that we really get to
the heart of the information so we're
really probing the size in the
neighborhood one way to get at this is
just with simple feature selection like
with the last lesson and if you put
these four features into a feature
selection tool maybe it would keep the
square footage but throw out the number
of rooms maybe it would keep the safety
and ignore the school ranking so here's
a little practice quiz which of the
feature selection tools do you think
would be most suitable for this these
are two examples that are both available
in SK learn a select percentile you're
already familiar with it just selects
the top X percent where you're allowed
to specify the percentage of features
that you want to keep another option is
select K best and this one's fairly
straightforward what you do is as one of
the arguments you specify what K is
that's the number of features that you
want to keep so if you put in 10 for K
it's going to take the 10 best features
and just to make you think about this a
little bit more let me get rid of the
knowledge that we already have for
features let's suppose that the number
of features you have available to you
isn't something that you know very well
say it's one of the first times you're
looking at this data set but you do know
that the size and the neighborhood are
going to be underlying latent variables
that are sort of driving the trends in
in all of the features that you have
available to you so the question for you
is if you want to have to output
features what's the most suitable
feature selection tool to use in this
scenario do you want to use select K
best or select percentile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
