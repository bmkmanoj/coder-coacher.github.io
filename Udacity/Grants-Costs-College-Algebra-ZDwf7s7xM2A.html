really good except right now I have no
idea what M is equal to remember that n
is just the money that grant has spent
now we've talked to many times before
about how the money that grant spends is
going to be a combination of fixed costs
like his rent for example and costs that
scale the number of items that he makes
or manufacturing costs let's say that
each class is wiper set costs ten
dollars to make and that grant makes
exactly as many wiper sets as he sells
in addition all of his fixed costs
together equal twenty thousand dollars
per month if all of this is the case
then how should we change the equation
for grants profit each month I'd like
you to first calculate M the money that
grant spends each month and then plug
this value for M into the equation that
we had for P before then simplify to get
your final answer I know this is a lot
to think about one problem and there are
several steps here so just make sure you
go through things slowly take everything
one step at a time and write all of your
work down on a piece of paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
