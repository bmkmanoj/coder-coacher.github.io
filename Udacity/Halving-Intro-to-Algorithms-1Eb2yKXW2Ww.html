statements that it takes to execute
naive a comma B is a linear function of
a shouldn't come as a surprise to us at
this point we actually plotted the
running time and it really did give a
very nice linear function Russians going
to be a bit trickier for a couple
reasons one is it seems much more
obscure how many times it's going to go
through this loop it seems like some of
the statements are actually conditioned
on properties that we don't necessarily
know as a simple function of the inputs
and the plot that we made was basically
useless it just seemed like the time was
more or less constant it's not actually
constant and we can actually work out a
function of what it is so the key step
in analyzing the number of steps that
this algorithm is going to take is
understanding how many times this loop
is going to be executed so the number of
times the loop is going to be executed
is going to be the same as the number of
times that it takes to divide X in half
before you get down to 0 this is again
1/2 and rounding down so how many times
can you divide X in half rounding down
before you get down to 0 so an important
thing you need to know is how many times
can you divide a number X in half
rounding down before it hits 0 so here's
some examples if X can be something
between 0 and 11 here's how many
having's the number 0 and you don't have
to have it at all they get down to 0 if
it's 1 you have to have it once if it's
2 you have to have it twice right once
to get you down to 1 and then once more
to get to 0 so it looks like it's a
linear function so far but actually it
diverges now so the number 3 you have to
have it once to get down to 1 then once
more for you have to do 3 times once to
get it to 2 then 1 then 0 and it stays
that way until you get to 8 it takes
four times once to get it to four to one
zero and it stays 4 for a while and the
next time it changes is at 16 so which
of these functions captures the
relationship between X and the number of
times X needs to be have to get down to
0 and just to simplify things a bit
let's get rid of the 0 case because it's
a bit messy the functions are X seems to
work for a little while X over 2 the log
base 2 of X and the log base 2 of X Flor
meaning rounded down if it's not an
integer plus 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
