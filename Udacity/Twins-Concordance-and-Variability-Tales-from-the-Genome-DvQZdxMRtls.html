twins race together rather than in
different environments but we can still
estimate heritability by comparing the
concordance of a trait between
monozygotic and dizygotic twins even
when they've been raised in similar
environments so if a pair of twins
matches for a trait we call it
concordance if they don't match then we
call it a discordant the higher the
concordance for trait in monozygotic
twins compared to dizygotic twins then
the higher the heritability of that
trait in other words the higher the
match in mountains I gotta quinn's when
there's a non match and dizygotic twins
suggest that the difference is the
genetics that the fact that the
monozygotic twins are identical where's
dizygotic twins were only half identical
right they only share 50% that being
identical that those genes those genetic
factors are important in making the
match alternatively if we found a lot of
matching between monozygotic twins as
well as a lot of matching between
dizygotic twins because we know that
there's a huge difference in the genetic
identity between these pairs of twins
that whatever's going on with the
matching likely has more to do with the
environment of the twins erasin rather
than the fact that the monozygotic twins
are identical
rather than genetics for example suppose
you're interested in handedness right or
left handedness taylor here is
left-handed and so is grant so they're
concordant for handedness now does this
mean that handedness has a high
heritability why or why not now I want
you to think about this for a second
don't just jump the gun and put
something down think about the question
and then come up with what you think is
a good answer and put it in the text box
