together here I've written out a
candidate example let's imagine that
bell hooks is P and cure or Bell is Q
well the first thing we're going to do
is find the index into P of the first
space Pete find space 0 1 2 3 4 and so
before in our running example q index
the location of this space in q might be
different 0 1 2 3 4 5 and in fact in our
example it is now what I want to do is
select out the first word in P so I want
everything from the beginning all the
way up to but not including this space
this selection goes to the left as far
as it can but does not include p index
so it will be Bell I could also have put
a 0 in here that would have been exactly
the same for Q I don't want to start at
position 5 I actually want to start at
position 6 starting with the B and going
to the end of the word so this is q
second word which in our running example
is also bell since Bell equals Bell will
just return true incurable was actually
a pseudonym a false name adopted by
