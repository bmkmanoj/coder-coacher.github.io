the first hurdle in iOS development you
have UI elements and you wire them up to
call your code with ib actions and you
reach back to the UI using ib outlets in
the second part of this lesson you're
going to learn how to set up multiple
views so that you can go between two
different view controllers no more
single view applications for you most
iOS applications you will be developing
will venture further than a single
screen in order to use multiple view
controllers you need another class that
lets you navigate between them there are
two common classes to use for handling
multiple view controllers in iOS UI
navigation controller and UI tab bar
controller both of these are covered in
depth when you get to UI kit
fundamentals in the next module for now
let's just discuss the basics of a
uinavigationcontroller the UI navigation
controller is a class that handles a
stack of multiple view controllers like
any other stack in computer science or
real life you can insert and remove
items from the stack in a
uinavigationcontroller you start out
with a single view controller called the
root view controller you can add as many
view controllers on top of it as you'd
like in pitch perfect we're going to
have just two view controllers one for
recording and one for playback so I use
a uinavigationcontroller will be just
for those two screens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
