what the client needs to do to know that
it's talking with the correct server and
needs to know that it's talking with
server s and knows that that's a public
key owned by s so if that's correct then
as owns the corresponding private key
and only that server can decrypt this
message and obtain the right session key
so this is the problem the certificate
is designed to solve number one would
work if we had a way to always know the
public key beforehand that would be
great we wouldn't need any other
solution this is not going to work for
websites this would only work if we
could preload the public key of all the
websites we might ever communicate with
into the browser that's not realistic we
need some other way of getting new
public keys for new sites as we visit
them verifying the certificate using k
us doesn't make any sense because k us
was provided by the server so if we used
the server's public key to verify the
certificate that would be a self-signed
certificate it wouldn't prove anything
since the signature is being verified
with a key provided by the person
claiming the signature that's why we
need the third solution which uses some
other key that the client already trusts
to verify the certificate and then the
information in the certificate to know
that it's the right server and to know
the server's public key</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
