writer protocol which means that this
action that's going on can be happening
simultaneously for the same page X on
different nodes of the cluster that's
perfectly fine so far as the protocol is
concerned because the assumption is that
the user has an association between
locks and the data structures governed
by the lock so even if the same page is
being modified hopefully different
portions are the same page is being
modified because concurrently if a page
is being modified that means that
different locks are protecting the
portions of the page that are being
modified by the different processes now
if rights are happening to the same
portion of a page and a different locks
that's the users problem that's a data
race that's not the problem of the DSM
software it's an application problem
because it represents a data race that
should not have been there if the
application is constructed correctly but
if the application is constructed
correctly and a multiple data structures
are hosted in the same page and the data
structures are all governed by different
locks DSM software has a way of ensuring
that change is made to a critical
section under a particular lock is
propagated from one processor to the
next processor with the first processor
is the current owner of the lock and the
next processor is the next user of the
lock so this implementation that I've
detailed here is an example of the
cooperation between the distributed
shared memory software and the operating
system to make it all happen and
particular trademarks implemented this
lrc multiple rider coherence protocol on
a unique system and in the unique system
in the operating system generates an
exception called 6 egg V in the
operating system layer when a shared
page is accessed by a thread this
exception is caught by the tread marks
runtime handler and at that point the
DSM software gets into gear contacts the
owner of the page checks the status of
the page and if the page is invalid then
it gets the page and the diffs for that
page and once it brings in the contents
of the page and the diffs it creates a
current version of the page and if the
process that is trying to access the
page is making a read access then there
is no problem but if the process that
wants to use that Paige wants to write
to it at that point it creates a twin
and does all the things that I just
mentioned so one thing that you'll
notice is that there is space overhead
for the creation of the twin at the
point of a right you have to create a
twin and then at the point of a release
you have to create you of course can get
rid of the twin but you're creating a
data structure so the twin and the diffs
are all data structures of the
implementation of distributed shared
memory and as time goes by there could
be a lot of these this that are lying
around in different notes imagine that a
page was touched by ten different
processors in that case they're going to
be dips lying around in ten different
processors and if eleventh processor
wants to access that same page the DSM
software has to go and bring the dips
from these ten prior users of the page
get the original page from the owner
apply the dips to create the new page a
lot of latency in is involved before the
guy who needs the page now can start
using it and also there is a lot of
space overhead and the fact that all
these disks are lying around so one of
the things that happens in in the DSM
software is garbage collection and that
is you keep a watermark of what is the
amount of dips that have been created in
the entire system if it exceeds a
threshold then you start applying these
lifts to the original copy of the page
at the owner so that you can then get
rid of the diffs completely why do you
need that well the lips are going to be
lying around till a long time till the
next time the page is accessed by
someone you don't want that so what
you're trying to do is
you're reducing the space overhead in
the DSM implementation by periodically
doing this garbage collection and
applying the lifts to the original copy
of the page so that he can get rid of it
from the system you don't want to do it
too eagerly but you don't want to wait
too long also because if a page has not
been accessed for a long time lips are
going to be lying around for a long time
so there'll be a demon process in every
node that every once in a while wakes up
and sees how much this have been created
in my node if it exceeds a threshold
then it said ok time to get to work let
me go and apply these lifts to the
original copy of the page so that I can
get rid of the deaths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
