gets called when the viewcontroller
class is loaded into memory this diagram
illustrates the view and view controller
lifecycle when the view and view
controller are changing states these
functions if you have implemented them
will get called in iOS the will
functions always get called before the
did functions we will appear gets called
before the view controller in its view
our on-screen view did appear gets
called right after the view and view
controller are on screen this is really
useful if you want something to happen
right before or right after a view
controllers view appears if you override
these functions in your view controller
they will get called otherwise their
default and empty implementations in the
UI view controller class will get called
instead the last point bears repeating
as it is a common error I've seen many
times if you miss type the function name
it's not the same function for example
view will appear as you see here has an
extra P and two iOS it is a completely
different function than the one that's
looking for so we'll never call this
function even though our code would
compile remember programming is an
exercise in trying to be as precise as
possible don't worry too much though
Xcode autocomplete will help you in
filling out the names of these functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
