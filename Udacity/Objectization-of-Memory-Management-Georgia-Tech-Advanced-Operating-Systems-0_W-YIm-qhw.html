mechanism let's talk about object
ization of the memory management
function we first start with the address
space of the process the address space
of the process is shared by all the
threads and there's got to be a
representation for the address space and
that is your process object and it is
shared by all the threads that are
executing on the CPU so you can think of
this process object there's somewhat
equivalent to the process control block
in a traditional setting now what we
want to do is we're gonna take this
address space remember that I mentioned
I don't want a centralized data
structure that describes the address
space because intuitively if you think
about a multi-threaded application the
different threads of the application may
be accessing different portions of the
address space and therefore there is no
reason to have a centralized data
structure in the operating system to
describe the entire address space of
that process so what we're going to do
is we're going to take the address space
and break it into regions so there is a
green region here and a purple region
here so the green region is a portion of
the address space the the purple region
is another portion of the address space
logically they're all part of the
operating system data structure the page
table but what we have done is we have
sort of detonated the page table data
structure in a central data structure
and said that well there is a portion of
the space table data structure the green
region another portion which is the
purple region and of course these
regions have to be backed by files on
the storage subsystem so we will call
them these objects as file cache
managers so similar to breaking up the
address space into regions we're going
to carve up the backing store also into
what are called file cache manager that
backs each one of these regions so for
instance this FCM 1 is a piece of the
storage subsystem that backs this region
R 1 and similarly FCM 2 backs this
region R 2 of course for any of these
threads to do their work the regions
that they're executing in they have to
be in physical memory so that they can
actually get to the instructions and
data corresponding
to that portion of the address space and
therefore we need a page frame manager
and the page frame manager is also going
to be implemented as an object a DM
object and the via an object is the one
that serves page frame so when you when
the page fault service needs to get a
page frame it contacts a page frame
d-damn object in order to get a physical
page frame so that it can then move the
contents of this backing file the file
cache manager for that particular region
and bring that from the storage
subsystem into the DRAM for future used
by a particular thread so that is
another object and of course you have to
do the input output in order to move the
page from this backing store into DRAM
and so we're going to declare that there
will be another object which we call the
cached object representation cor and
this is the one that is going to be
responsible for knowing the location of
the object that you're looking for on
the backing store and do the actual page
