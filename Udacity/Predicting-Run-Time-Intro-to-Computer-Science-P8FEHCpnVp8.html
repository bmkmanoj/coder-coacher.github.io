execution time well enough to make some
predictions so here's the code we had
before that times the execution of
evaluating a Python expression that we
pass in as code and we've defined spin
loop as a while loop that goes through a
loop that just adds one the number of
times of the variable passed in so let's
try that in the Python interpreter we're
going to time and execution where what
we're evaluating is calling spin loop
passing in some numbers so we'll try a
thousand first and what time execution
does is return two values the result and
the run time we only want the second one
so we'll index to get the second value
out of the return result and see that
result so that's what we get
so it took point zero zero zero one
seconds to do spin loop a thousand if I
increase this to ten thousand I see that
it takes point zero zero zero six let's
try a hundred thousand adding one more
zero and I see now at tanks point zero
zero five I'm going to write this a
little differently so we can see it more
easily so now instead of writing out a
hundred thousand I'll do ten star star
five which is the same value as writing
out a one followed by five zeros and for
good measure we'll do ten star star 6
which is the million times through the
loop and we see that that takes point
zero five seconds so here's the examples
of timing loops for your quiz your goal
is to estimate the expected execution
time for evaluating spin loop where the
input of the loop is ten star star nine
that's one billion and you should give
your answer in the number of seconds of
course it's not possible to get the
exact answer but you should be able to
get a guess within about 20 percent of
our answer to be correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
