the parsing CSV files exercise we're
going to begin here by opening the file
the next thing to note is that we're
going to read the first line of that
file and split it using the comma
character as a delimiter this will give
us a list of values that we can use as
keys for each one of the data items that
we pull out of this file later on okay
we're then going to loop through the
lines of the file we'll break out of
this loop once we process ten lines for
every line up to that we're gonna split
the line again using the comma as the
delimiter and then we're going to
initialize this empty dictionary now the
entry each time through is going to be
this data item that we'll construct
using the keys that we got from the
first line of the file and the
individual field values that we just got
here we're going to loop through the
fields and using enumerate we'll get a
index value in addition to the value for
each item in this fields list that will
allow us to access the appropriate value
in the header to use as a key for that
particular field in our entry or our
data item and then we'll use the
corresponding value as the value for
that particular field now note that in
both cases we're using the strip method
here and here in order to pull off any
extraneous whitespace around either the
header value or the individual value for
this line of the file this is a first
example of data cleaning which is
another major theme of this course in
Excel files or in CSV files a lot of
times you'll have garbage whitespace
that surround values you don't really
notice them or care about them in the
file itself but when you're processing
them in Python they can make a big
difference especially if you're doing
comparisons between values so it's
always a good idea to use strip okay
finally we're going to append that one
data item to our data array so that it's
included in the list of items that we
return from this function parse file</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
