effect of choosing to augment by a
shortest path we'll let M be a matching
and we'll let P be a shortest augmenting
path for M and then we'll let Q be an
augmenting path for M augmented by P
well then the size of Q is at least the
size of P plus twice the overlap between
P and Q in terms of the number of edges
for the proof we first observe that the
size of M augmented by P and augmented
by Q minus the size of the original
matching M is equal to 2 so the
symmetric difference between the
Augmented version and the original which
is also equal to the symmetric
difference between P and Q must contain
two vertex disjoint augmenting paths of
length at most P they couldn't be
shorter than P otherwise P wouldn't be a
shortest path therefore the total number
of edges in the symmetric difference
between P and Q is at least twice the
size of P now the size of Q plus the
size of P is the size of what is in
exactly one of the two plus twice the
size of what is in both you can think
about the overlap being counted once in
P and once in Q but not at all in the
symmetric difference
well then applying our bound on the size
of the symmetric difference between P
and Q we then have that this is at most
twice the size of P plus 2 times the
overlap of P and Q and subtracting off
the size of P from both sides gives us
the theorem a corollary of this lemma is
that if P and Q are the same size then
they have to be vertex disjoint the fact
that they are edge disjoint follows
directly from this equation to argue
that they have to be vertex disjoint
will argue that sharing a vertex implies
sharing an edge so let's take this
theorem and suppose not we'll let V be a
shared vertex
well then V has to be matched in M
augmented by P so Q must share the
matched edge with P we can visualize
this argument by drawing P with the
original matching M then once we augment
it P becomes like so and regardless of
what vertex the path Q happen to share
with it that vertex is now matched in M
augmented by P so Q has to follow that
edge but then Q and P share an edge and
Q is greater than P by at least two and
that then leads to a contradiction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
