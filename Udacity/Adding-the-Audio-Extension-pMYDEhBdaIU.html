involves setting up audio player nodes
with content we will also be using the
av audio unit time pitch class to make
changes to the pitch of the audio output
in order to make your audio playback
code a little easier we've included the
functions you need in a class extension
file that you can import into
pitch-perfect class extensions allows us
to add code to the place sounds view
controller class even though this code
resides in another file this is going to
provide you with a black box to play
back the audio but don't worry you can
see all the code inside the black box
and I'll cover it line by line a little
later in this lesson in the place sounds
view controller that swift file add the
following instance variables and anam
after the ib outlets now we can bring in
the class extension it is a file called
place sounds view controller plus audio
swift and you can find it in the
resources for this lesson I have it here
on this folder and I'll just drag it
into Xcode make sure a copy item if
needed is checked and that the pitch
perfect target is also checked click
finish I'm going to walk you through the
code you've just added line by line a
little later in this lesson for now we
can concentrate on just calling out to
it and having the audio playback first
we want to add a call to the set up
audio function in viewdidload so that
the av audio engine is properly set up
this is one of the functions that is
included in the extension you've just
added in to pitch perfect add the line
to call setup audio here in the view did
load function next let's configure the
UI so that the stop button is disabled
when this view first appears as the app
won't be playing any sound until the
user presses one of the six playback
buttons in the extension file you just
dragged in there's a convenience
function to reset the buttons to the
proper state when playing or not playing
music we need to set them to not playing
right before the view first appears on
screen now what function could we use
for that if you're thinking
viewwillappear you're right let's add
the view will appear function to the
play sounds view controller in view will
appear at a call to the configure you I
function telling it to set the buttons
to the not playing state one step left
before pitch-perfect can play back the
audio and that is we're going to be
covering neck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
