about objects fields and records you can
get back to the festival app with
Samantha Nandi all right cool so we've
made some progress right we had some
fields
I guess what should we do next so let's
go back to the cloud stock record that
we already created and then add values
to the fields we just created oh that
makes sense
that suck okay cool so right that's
awesome so the fields are there they're
not they're empty I guess that makes
sense don't just hit edit I guess yep
all right so let's give it a start date
how about November 29th sounds good okay
an end date let's do like December first
it's gonna be a weekend festival let's
say you can have 10,000 people and we
haven't sold any ticket to it cool okay
all right cool no we've got our festival
object it's got all these fields I mean
I think of that in terms of spreadsheets
I'm the Salesforce guru like you are so
how what should we do in that sort of
thinking so if we're gonna think about
it like a spreadsheet let's let's take a
look at it on the tablet we have our
name and so that's cloud stock and we
have our start date and our end date can
hold 10,000 people and we haven't sold
any ticket to it womp-womp really we
have all of our fields here along the
top and this is our record that we've
created just now but where does
attendees fall into this do we create
another column for that what do you
think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
