of these five non-functional
requirements that we'll be using in this
lesson after we do this we will see how
each of them influences systems built
with different architectural styles for
each quality we will provide a
definition a ways in which the quality
might be measured and some devices that
are used to provide this quality first
off for performance the software
engineering institutes definition of
performance is that attribute of a
computer system that characterizes the
timeliness of the services delivered by
the system and we can measure this in a
lot of different ways in terms of
response time throughput system capacity
system utilization and there are many
devices that programmers can use to
improve performance for example caching
concurrency memory management and so on
the second quality we want to look at is
maintainability and this is the extent
to which enhancements can be readily
added to a system this is sometimes also
called the evolvability flexibility
adaptability and so on the measures and
we've talked about these earlier are
coupling and cohesion and there's many
devices such as encapsulation publishing
your interfaces use of sub classing in
direction and wrapping the third quality
is reliability and this is the
likelihood of failure of system failure
in a given period of time that is the
continuity of service that the system
provides the typical measure for this is
called mean time to failure or MTTF some
of the devices that can be used to
provide a high reliability include
redundancy fault tolerance and recovery
blocks software safety is the extent to
which a system protects against injury
loss of life or property damage absence
of catastrophic consequences it can be
measured in terms of the complexity of
the system the time coupling and by
fault tree analysis some of the devices
include hardware interlocks in the case
that the particular system has
peripheral hardware devices and fault
containment strategies the fifth quality
they will that we will look at is
security and this is the extent to which
the system protects against unauthorized
intrusion or provides confidentiality
security is measured by
levels such as confidential and top
secret and sometimes formal proofs are
used to guarantee that the system a base
whatever its confidence level is some of
the devices include authentication
authorization security kernels
encryption auditing and logging and
access control mechanisms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
