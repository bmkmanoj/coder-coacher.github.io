locally which gives us a place to put
our files we have an account which gives
us a place online to have our files how
do we get them to talk to each other
okay well we're gonna need to sign in so
let's go to preferences okay all right
so yeah we want to allow that sure so
that was something about how it sort of
makes sure that it's us okay so now we
can access any repositories that we have
here but we don't have any yet right so
but we're gonna need to go actually get
the repository okay do a story from
github
what should I do search for that yes
okay all right so we found his
repository okay so there are two options
here we could clone it which means that
we would just have a local version of
his repository or we can fork it which
means that we make our own copy of the
repository that we can then put on our
local machine okay and what should we do
since I don't think we want to make any
changes to his repository I think we
want to fork it so that we have our own
totally separate one okay at least
working it I like this
second refresh and there we go right so
now we have our own copy that is cool so
these are all those files that I had
copied and pasted before the JavaScript
files style files and then this index
file very cool
yeah so now if we go back over here and
refresh it shows awesome and we can
clone it to our local machine all right
so we now have a copy of the repository
on our machine okay great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
