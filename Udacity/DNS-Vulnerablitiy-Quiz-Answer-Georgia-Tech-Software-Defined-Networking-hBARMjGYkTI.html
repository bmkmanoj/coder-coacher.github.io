work is that spammers can perform
behavior on the network that is
extremely uncanny and unlikely to be
performed by a legitimate network user
for example what we saw is that the
spammer could hijack an IP prefix for a
very short period of time such as 10
minutes send the spam or potentially
multiple spam messages from IP addresses
inside that IP prefix and at the end of
the attack withdraw the prefix this
allows attackers to use ephemeral IP
addresses essentially rendering IP
blacklist ineffective in fact we saw on
any given day about ten percent of the
email senders are from previously unseen
IP addresses this ephemerality or
transience of the IP addresses of the
spam senders makes it particularly
difficult to maintain a blacklist in
fact we found many single packet
features that tended to work well in
other words features that a receiver
could make a decision on just based on
the first packet that a sender sends
such single packet features include the
distance between the sender and the
receiver the density in IP space in
terms of how many other male senders are
nearby and the local time of day at the
sender other features such as the AAS of
the sender's IP also worked well if
we're willing to look beyond a single
packet and look at a single message the
number of recipients and the length of
the message also proved to be effective
in distinguishing spammers from
legitimate senders finally we can look
at aggregates for example if we're
willing to look at a group of email
messages we can see how message length
varies over time or across a group of
different messages putting these
features together in a system called
snare or spatio-temporal network level
automated reputation engine achieved a
70-percent detection rate for a false
positive rate of about one tenth of 1%
this level of accuracy is good enough to
be used in practice it provides
comparable performance
to state-of-the-art ip-based blacklist
such as spam house but it only uses
network level features thus making it
less susceptible to the ephemeral nature
of ip-based blacklisting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
