focused an element we relied on the
built-in browser focus ring to style
that element for us the focus ring is
great because without it it's impossible
for a keyboard user to tell which
element is currently focused in fact the
webbing checklist specifically states in
section 2 4 dots 7 that it should be
visually apparent which page element has
the current keyboard focus as you tab
through the page but sometimes the
default focus ring may not fit in well
with your design for instance here I've
got a blue focus ring on a blue
background so it's just really hard to
see and in some cases the focus ring can
kind of awkwardly wrap around elements
as we saw in our lesson to your radio
group example so we need a way to change
the appearance of our element and we'd
like that change to happen only when the
element is focused to do this we can use
the focus pseudo-class the focus pseudo
class only matches when an element has
focus to change the appearance of our
focus ring we can then use the outline
property here i'm using the outline
property to change the appearance of the
focus ring to a 1 pixel dotted white
line now some developers choose to
remove this style all together by
setting the outline property of the
element 20 or none and this by itself is
a major anti-pattern without a focus
indicator how was a keyboard user
supposed to tell which item they're
interacting with if you're going to
remove the focus ring because you don't
like how it looks then you need to
replace it with another consistent focus
indicator so a keyboard or switch device
user can navigate your page using that
example from before let's look at how we
can provide our own alternative focus
indicator so you might be familiar with
adding hover states to your controls
using the hover pseudo class here I've
set my buttons to have a red background
with white text and I text underline
whenever they're hovered you can
actually see this in practice as I go in
mouse over the items in my page so a
simple solution of removing the focus
ring and replacing it is just to give
your element the same hover in focus
styles I can do this by adding another
line to my block of CSS hear that
uses the focus pseudo-class now because
the hover style might not make it
obvious which element has focus I'm also
going to write a style specifically
using the focus pseudo-class this style
right here is going to remove that
default focus ring and replace it with a
color box shadow now you might be
wondering why use a box shadow instead
of just changing the color of the focus
ring which is a really good question
because the various browsers out there
style the outline property slightly
differently just changing the color
might not always produce a consistent
experience using a box shadow here I
know that I'm going to get a consistent
focus indicator across the different
browsers now as I tab through the page
it's much easier to tell which element
currently has focus let's use the same
technique to fix up the radio group
example from lesson 2 i'll start off by
removing this sort of awkward wrapping
focus indicator by setting the outline
to none using that focus pseudo class
and then i'll use a focus style to just
target my before pseudo elements these
are what actually produce our little
radio circles here i'm going to give
those radio circles a blue-tinted box
shadow so now when the user presses
their arrow keys it's very obvious which
item currently has focus so to sum it up
if at all possible leave the default
browser focus ring in place as it's what
many users have come to expect if
however the ring is clashing with your
page styles or it's just awkwardly
wrapping around your elements then you
can use the focus pseudo class to
provide your own custom focus indicator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
