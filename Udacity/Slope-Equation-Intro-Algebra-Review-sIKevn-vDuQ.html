change over horizontal change and that's
exactly what slope is and we've been
using the words rise and run and the way
we've been finding the slope is by
looking at a line and finding two points
let's say in this case 00 and I don't
know 24 and then we've been finding the
rise in the run by actually counting 1 2
3 4 is my rise and 12 is my run so this
would have a slope of 4 over 2 which i
guess is too and that's fine that works
but what if we don't have the image of
the line itself how can i get the slope
then well what we want to do is come up
with a mathematical method of taking two
points like 24 and 0 0 and somehow
getting the slope from them in luckily
exactly this method exists now we
typically use the letter M to stand for
slope and please don't ask me why I have
no idea what M has to do a slope but the
equation when we have two points looks
something like this y2 minus y1 over x2
minus x1 these little twos and ones are
called subscripts and what do they mean
well these twos mean we're referring to
our second point and the ones mean we're
referring to the first point so this
would be the y coordinate of the first
point the x-coordinate of the first
point x coordinate the second and y
coordinate of the second and i'm going
to show you how i would use this
equation with these points so here our
first point was this one here 00 though
in truth it doesn't matter which we call
first in which we call second and her
second point was this one here to come
before and since I said x1 was the
x-coordinate of the first point it
corresponds to that 0 and y 1 is the
y-coordinate of the first point
corresponds to that 0 x2 is this 2 and y
2 is this for and so to use this
equation to calculate the slope i would
say m equals well why to which is 4
minus y1 which is zero over x2 which is
two minus x1 which is zero which is just
for over two
or two and this makes a lot of sense the
numerator up here y2 minus y1 well
that's just the change here the vertical
change em x2 minus x1 that's this
horizontal change so why don't you
practice now what's the slope of a line
that goes to the points 3 comma 2 and 5
comma 5 enter your answer here numerator
and denominator in these boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
