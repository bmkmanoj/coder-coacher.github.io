signature is created via a calculation
performed on the data being sent so it's
unique to that message it can then be
used for two purposes to validate that
the message was unaltered in transit and
that it actually came from the purported
sender remember the attachment was
encrypted using the recipients public
key the signature is encrypted using the
sender's private key recipients public
key for the message senders private key
for the signature since anyone can
obtain the sender's public key anyone
can decrypt the signature here's where
people get confused keep two things in
mind the digital signature is not the
message it is derived from the message
so once decrypted it can be used to
assure that the message can be trusted
and that it wasn't altered in transit
the fact that it can be decrypted using
the sender's public key assures that it
was encrypted by the sender using their
private key thus validating the source
of the message know where was the
sender's private key or protected health
information compromised that's the
essence of pki for trust most people who
aren't already familiar with PK I find
this confusing so here are some
questions to make sure you're clear</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
