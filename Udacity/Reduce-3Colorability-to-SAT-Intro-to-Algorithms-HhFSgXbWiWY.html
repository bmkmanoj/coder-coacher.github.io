np-complete meaning that it's np-hard it
has to be the case that we could use sad
to solve three colouring problems but
it's actually a little bit interesting
to see how you might do that
so let's let's take a look here's a
simple little graph and one two three
four nodes four edges and imagine that
we want to try to three color this graph
what we're going to do is we're going to
create a boolean formula that is
satisfiable if and only if this graph is
3 colorable so that it's really the same
problem and the way that we're going to
do that is we're going to create a bunch
of boolean variables 12 them to be exact
corresponding to each of the four nodes
a b c and d and for each node we'll have
a boolean variable saying whether that
node is red or green or yellow the three
colors so for example assigning the
variable a red to true a green to false
and a yellow to false means that we're
coloring the a node red and so once
we've assigned truth values trues and
falses to all 12 of these variables that
corresponds perhaps to some coloring in
fact you have to be a little bit careful
here because if we assign two of these
to true which is a perfectly reasonable
thing to do in a boolean formula you
can't really interpret this as a
coloring except for maybe a is orange
but that's not really a that's not
really allowed so so what we have to do
now is given these twelve variables we
have to create a formula that is true if
and only if it corresponds to a valid
coloring meaning that both exactly one
of each of these triples of variables
are true and there's no collisions for
example we can't have a colored red and
be colored red because they're connected
by an edge they all have to be different
if they're connected by an edge so the
formula for this can be generated
automatically and I'll give you a
glimpse at it so so here it is at least
one version of it and it's a little bit
weird and complicated but it actually
falls into some nice structure so first
there's a bunch of bunch of logic to say
that it should be the case that say the
the a red a green and a yellow variables
one of them should be true if they were
all false then that's it's not telling
us what color a should be and it also
has to be the case that no pair of
colors can be true for a given node so
it can't be the case that both a red is
true and a green is true that's bad so
there has to be at least one true and
not the case that both a is both red and
green not the case that a is both red
and yellow and not the case that both a
is green and yellow and we do that for
all four the nodes and that tells us
that it is that there's a meaningful
color assignment to the nodes then we
have some additional clauses that say
what can't be the case that a is red and
B is red at the same time it can't be
the case that a is green and B is green
at the same time and it can't be the
case that a is yellow and B is yellow at
the same time what is that saying that's
saying that the color whatever the color
happens to be for a it can't match the
color of B and that's because they share
an edge in the graph so for each of the
edges in the graph we have three of
these statements to rule out all
possible color matchings so there's
three of these for one edge to edge
three edge there's four edges in the
graph so we have four blocks of these
and this formula now as a whole has a
satisfying assignment has an assignment
that makes this whole expression true if
and only if there's a coloring a three
coloring of that graph now in this case
I generated this formula by carefully
looking at the graph and going back and
forth and making making formula but you
can automate this idea by just
generalizing the way that I did this
here so why don't you think about how to
do that and I'll ask you a question to
just to make sure that you've got the
idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
