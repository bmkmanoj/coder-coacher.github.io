more about people than about robots even
I mean I have learned a lot about robots
making robots is insanely complicated
and I like to say the Devils in the
details
if you get any little detail wrong that
could be the thing that sinks your robot
it's just useless if any one of those
things is very wrong but making curry
successful is all about human robot
interaction and about design and about
making things intuitive and compelling
and lifelike and a lot of that has to do
more about how people actually are or
how people react to things or what
people can understand and a lot of that
goes into making the robot successful
the key to success for a home robot I
think is in personality and in getting
the robot to look lifelike and accepted
in the home and a lot of that has to do
with getting the interaction right with
people and getting the look of the
robots right so he looks lifelike and so
that he's accepted in the home as a
member of your family something that you
see every day trundling around he has to
be compelling he has to be adorable so
my advice to you is robotics was a great
field there are a lot of fun jobs in
robots
especially today roboticists are highly
sought after I know because I'm trying
to hire and it's really hard and there
look you should go out there and build
lots of robots and have lots of fun one
thing I'm looking for a lot in a robot
assist right now is we're looking for
software engineers and so we want very
strong programming skills and so a lot
of robots is coming out of school they
know how to program robots but they
don't know much about software carpentry
so learning the basics of how to write
tests and how do continuous integration
and having really good skills in writing
things like C++ and Python those are all
very important to us so one of the
biggest things I've learned about trying
to start this company I thought when we
started this company oh this was my
chance to learn all the ins and outs on
how to make adorable consumer robots
awesome consumer robots now what I've
learned is the way you make awesome
consumer robots is by hiring a team that
can make awesome consumer robots it's
all about the team and the people you
work with you have to have experts in so
many different things to make a
successful consumer robot and hiring
good people is everything and also I've
learned it's really important to make
your company very diverse and
family-friendly those are some of the
core values of our company we care a lot
about making sure people have good
work-life balance and that they take
care of their families
and that were we're a friendly place for
people to work even when they have small
children they need time to deal with
their small children and making a
company diverse and family friendly it's
not just a better place to work but it
also helps you to make robots that
appeal to everybody so you don't have
robots that just appeal to you know very
narrow demographic of you know focus
engineers you have robust appeals
through all different shapes and sizes
of people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
