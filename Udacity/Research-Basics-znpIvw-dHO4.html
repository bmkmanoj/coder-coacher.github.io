course is a track on a research research
is contributing to humans broader
understanding of some phenomenon or in
this class contributing to our
understanding of education and learning
for example you might want to
investigate how a particular tool
changes the learning process or maybe
you want to investigate how different
demographics or backgrounds change a
person's perceptions of an online
program like this one but research is
very much its own language its own
community in order to participate in
research there's light need to
understand this is going to be kind of a
crash course and everything you need to
know to do research at least at the
level that we're looking at we'll talk
about some of the vocabulary of research
will talk about validity and reliability
and some of the things you need to be
aware of during research especially
we'll talk about different research
designs how to set up an experiment or
set up some research that will actually
answer the questions that you want to
answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
