regards to memory is what's known as
long-term potentiation long term
potentiation is the strengthening of a
synaptic connection that happens when
the synapse of one neuron repeatedly
fires and excites another neuron much of
the work on the study of long-term
potentiation came from hip now you
should recall hebbs law from our lesson
on the brain neurons that fire together
wire together another researcher Candell
discovered that even a sea slug was able
to create a long term memory this is
found by how the sea slug reacted to a
shock so what he did was administered a
shock to the tail of a sea slug and the
sea slug had a defensive response when
he did this only one time the defensive
posture lasted about ten minutes however
if he did this four to five times in
close succession the sea slug had the
same defensive response that lasted for
days after the shocks which shows the
sea slug created a long-term memory
since its response lasted four days
Candell quoted the conversion from short
to long-term memory storage requires
spaced repetition this goes along with
the idea that practice makes perfect
even in snails so from research such as
this we can see again the importance of
neurons firing together and wiring
together and the result that changes in
our brain and our behavior other
research by Candell showed how
particular genes getting turned on in
the nucleus of a cell can signal neural
structures to grow which is neurogenesis
but this only happens during long-term
memory not during short-term memory
amazingly what this means is that every
time we learn something that's long-term
it's because our brain has actually
changed so if you remember what we're
talking about right now in this lesson
next week that means that your brain has
officially formed new neural connections
which are the basis for your memory of
this lesson so you can officially say
that your Udacity psychology class
physically changed your brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
