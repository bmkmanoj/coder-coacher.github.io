available all this changed
you can now program whatever functions
you want it when you select the material
and lighting what the 3GS library does
under the hood is create efficient
vertex and fragment shader programs for
you however you can create and modify
your own materials by using 3G haces
shader material vertex and fragment
shaders have similar structures you
first define the inputs to the shader
there are two kinds of declaration in
3GS uniform and varying in WebGL itself
there are also attributes for a vertex
shader which are the values such as the
vertex position normal and UV coordinate
data these attributes are built in for
3GS so do not have to be declared in
fact they have those exact names
position normal UV uniform data is
whatever is constant for the triangle
being shaded for example values such as
the position of the light sources and
the color and shininess of the material
are uniforms a value is labeled as
varying if it is computed or set by the
vertex shader as an output and pass to
the fragment shader as an input the
vertex shader outputs these values and
then the rasterizer interpolates these
across the triangle surface in other
words these values can and will vary per
fragment you're in total control of what
gets interpolated the more data per
vertex that you want interpolated the
more time resources it takes nothing
comes for free the fragment shader also
takes uniform data as inputs the
fragment shader then as a minimum
outputs a fragment color with the name
GL frag color I say as a minimum because
in fact in many graphics ap is the
fragment shader can output to a number
of images at one time this is called MRT
for multiple render targets targets is
another name for output images
unfortunately WebGL does not support
this yet to summarize here's three JSA's
view of the world a vertex shader has
inputs that are uniforms and attributes
and always outputs a GL position and can
output varying values the fragment
shader takes these varying values along
with whatever uniforms at once and
outputs a GL frag color</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
