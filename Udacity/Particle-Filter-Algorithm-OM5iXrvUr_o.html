straightforward to do this alright we
start off at any point in time we have a
set of particles at the last time step
and each particle has a state like its
position and a weight and we're also
going to be given a new action like take
a step to the to the right two meters
and we're going to take a new
measurement and then here's how the
particle filter runs we start off with a
new set of particles empty and a
normalization constant of zero makes
sense and then we just do the following
end times where n is the number of
particles that we need all right so the
first thing we do is we sample a
particle from the previous distribution
that's from this distribution here
according to its weight okay so we just
sample a particle okay the next thing we
do this is actually a combined step okay
it says control but it really should say
control and control and diffusion right
we sample a new state using two things
whatever the old one was so that's the
value we pulled from the particle right
that's this XT here we've sampled a
particle it has a particular state that
goes right in there we also have the
action and then we have to sample from
the new distribution so let's suppose
the action is take a step immediate to
the right every time I do is Maegan
alright take a step meter to the right
and then I'm going to sample from a
distribution because there's actually
some uncertainty about that step right
that's our process noise so it's a
little tight Gaussian I generated a
little bit of noise and I add that
that's what this sampling value is here
using the previous sample the control
and then whatever the noise is okay then
what I do is I reweighed that sample
what do i weighted by i weighted by how
likely would the measurement have been
this is my likelihood okay how likely
would that measurement bin if that new
sample is actually where the object was
or where the robot was
that becomes my new weight all right
that's the multiplication step we did
before we took our prior we had those
lumps we multiplied and got them through
we just keep track of the sum of those
weights we add that particle to our
growing set of particles and we do this
end times now we're all done except one
problem our weights don't sum to what
they don't sum to one because they were
whatever they were we just did this
multiplication so all we have to do is
because we've been keeping track of the
sum of the weights that's the ADA we
divide all the weights by that value
that's normalizing the weights when
we're done we have a new distribution a
bunch of particles each particle is at a
particular state each particle has a
weight and the sum of those weights is
one and so that's a valid sampling based
representation of the probabilistic
density and that's it that's all of
particle filtering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
