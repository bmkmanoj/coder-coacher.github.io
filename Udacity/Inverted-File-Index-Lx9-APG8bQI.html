is if we've got these sort of thousands
of features per image and maybe millions
or hundreds of millions of images or
patches you know what's an efficient way
to search to figure out which image had
about the same sets of patches or at
least has a high overlap in the set of
patches that I find in a new image and
what we do is we take a little bit of
inspiration from other systems that have
lots of little instances in them namely
things like words and indices right so
if I've got a book it would be really
hard to find all the examples of where
it says Karl Marx in that book by
flipping through that book so what do we
do instead we build an index right
there's an index in the back it's an
efficient way to find all the pages that
contain a particular word okay so what
we want to do is we want to find all the
images from a known database that have a
particular feature that we find so now
what's going to happen is I'm going to
find a bunch of features that are in a
new image I'm gonna look up the
different images that have those
features and maybe if I find an image
that has a lot of the same features as
my new image then I say aha maybe it's
the same kind of thing and this comes to
the notion of what we call visual words
okay so the feature descriptors we
sometimes refer to as visual words we're
gonna get two code words in a minute but
the idea is that and I think really this
notion of words comes from this whole
analogy with text processing right so
we've got words are the local features
and documents are the entire image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
