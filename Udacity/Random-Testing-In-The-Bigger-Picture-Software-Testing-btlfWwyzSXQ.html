about how random testing fits into the
larger software development process so
first of all I just want to start by
asking the question why is it the random
testing works at all and I don't think
the answer to this question is actually
known in any kind of a detailed sense
but we do know parts of the answer a big
part is that random testing is based on
very weak hypotheses about where bugs
live and what I mean by this is every
test case that we run is a little
experiment the input to the experiment
is the test case and the outcome of the
experiment is a bit of information about
whether the system worked or it didn't
work and so random what random testing
does is it makes the conditions under
which we're running the experiment
weaker we don't have to guess about some
particular thing that might fail but
we're rather doing is guessing about a
whole class of things that might
possibly fail this turns out to be
powerful because given the very complex
behavior of modern software people don't
seem to be very good about forming good
hypotheses about where bugs lie second
reason is people tend to make the same
mistakes while their coding and while
they're testing so for example if I
forget to take into account some sort of
a special case while I'm implementing my
system I probably also forget to test it
what I mean by this is that if I forgot
to implement some feature or if I miss
implement its own feature I'm not going
to test the stuff that I did wrong
because if I was able to think of the
test case I probably would've got the
feature right in the first place it's a
random testing to some extent gets us
out of this problem because it can
construct test cases the test things
that we don't actually understand or
know very well the third reason is
there's a gigantic asymmetry between how
fast computers are and how fast people
are so even if the random tester is
mostly generating stupid test cases if
we could generate a reasonably if it can
generate a clever test case maybe one in
a million times just by getting lucky
then that still might be a more
effective use of our testing resources
than writing test cases by hand and
there's been a similar finding in other
areas for example the game go has an
extremely large state space and it was
traditionally thought the computer go
players were just never going to be very
good the game was just too hard but
turned out to be the case is is that
today's computer go players are quite a
bit stronger than previous ones and are
based on what are called Monte Carlo
methods which are simply randomized
methods for exploring small parts of the
go state space and it turns out that
this is often good enough to create
respectably strong players they're still
not nearly as good as the best human
players but they do pretty well now if
you this is exploiting sort of a very
similar insight to random testing where
we probabilistically explore these
spaces that are very large and even if
we can't achieve any kind of meaningful
coverage we can still often find
interesting things special if we have
these extremely fast or an eight-core
they're really quite cheap today now I'd
like to ask a slightly different
question which is why random testing is
so incredibly effective on commercial
software at least sometimes so I don't
want to do here start some sort of a
debate about whether random testing is
or isn't effective I think there's
pretty ample evidence so for example the
fuzzer papers that we discussed
yesterday or the talk that you can watch
online babysitting an army of monkeys
people shown the random testing really
is effective on computer on commercial
software and why is that I'm gonna give
some opinions and of course you should
feel free to disagree with these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
