principal components are about the
directions the component is really a
direction in a feature space along which
the points that you care about in that
space have the greatest variation or
variance will make all of this more
formal in a minute so the first it says
pc here first principal component is the
direction of maximum variance now a
quick word of warning you can see here
I've got this little symbol here that
indicates that's where the mean of the
points is principal components is
mathematically defined about the origin
so what we typically do is we talked
about moving all the points to have
their mean at the origin but then we
forget that it's doing that we have to
do it in the math boys affair and we
would draw something like this and say
you see this this direction that's the
first principal component of those
points it's the direction of maximum
variance they're not around the origin
here so we have to shift it actually
before we do the computation but when we
think about it we're only talking about
with respect to the mean and the
subsequent principal components are
perpendicular or orthogonal to the
previous ones and describe the next
greatest amount of variance now in two
dimensions we're sort of done right so
we say well that's the first one well
the next one's got to be there because
there's only two dimensions so it's got
to go that direction but if I was in
three dimensions I would have my first
dimension and then everything would be
along there so I could remove that
collapse it down to a plane I'd say in
that plane what's the maximum variation
that would be my second one and then I
would have the third one that would be
left</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
