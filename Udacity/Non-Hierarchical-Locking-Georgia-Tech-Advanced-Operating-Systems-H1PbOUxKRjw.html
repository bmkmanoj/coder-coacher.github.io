subsystem and of course the whole idea
of object ization of the memory
management subsystem or any subsystem
for that matter is to increase the
concurrency for system services that
we're going to offer for the threads
that are executing on the processors so
in the memory management subsystem the
main service that you're offering is the
page fault service and let's say that in
this example there are two threads t1
and t2 let's assume that they've been
mapped to the same processor which means
with the object ization that I described
to you they are sharing a process object
so if t1 inquires a page fault it's
going to go through the process object
to the region that corresponds to this
particular page fault and now let's
think about what needs to happen in
order to service this page fault we
might do hierarchical locking so for
instance if I want to do some
modifications to the region object to
indicate that i'm modifying the data
structure that corresponds to this
portion of the address space i might say
that well let's lock the process object
let's lock the region object that it
corresponds to like let's lock the FCM
object that is backed by this region and
let's lock the COR object that is
actually going to do the i/o for me if I
do this and now let's say the operating
system is incurring a page fault for the
second thread pt2 and let's say that
this page fault because it is happening
on the same processor it shares the same
process object but maybe this page fault
is not for this region but it is for a
different region let's say region two
but if we have locked the process object
in servicing which this page fault then
we cannot get past this process object
because the lock is held on behalf of
servicing this particular page fault and
therefore the operating system cannot
process this page fault even though you
may have multiple cores on the processor
and these threads are executing on
different course of the same processor
you don't have the concurrency that you
want it so this hierarchical locking
kills concurrency and that's a bad idea
so what do you don't want to do
is due this hierarchical locking but it
seems like in order to service this page
fall if I want integrity for these
objects I want to be able to lock the
critical data structures but if the path
that is taken by this page fault is
different from the path that is taken by
this page fault why lock this object in
the first place so we don't have to lock
this object because the path taken by
the page fault service is different from
this and so hierarchical locking is a
bad idea it kills concurrency but you do
need integrity of this process object
and in particular if the reason why we
Lock this process object is in some
sense to ensure that this process that
object doesn't go away how can it go
away well one of the things that can
happen under the covers while page fault
service is happening there could be a
decision to migrate a process from one
processes to another processor and if
that happens then the process object may
be my created and that's the reason that
you have to worry about the integrity of
this process object when something is
happening that is going to modify
something in this process object you
don't want this process object to go
away that's actually to do with
existence guarantee so what we're going
to do is we're going to associate a
reference count with the object and
rather than do hierarchical locking what
we're going to do is put an existence
guarantee every time this object is
being used there's a reference count
that is associated with that and the
reference count is a way of guaranteeing
the existence of this object so let's
come back to this example again so if t1
has a page fault it first go to this
goes to this process object before it
goes to the region object because this
particular page fault is going to be
serviced through this region object path
but it is not going to hold a lock on
this object what is going to do is is
going to increment a reference count for
this object saying that this object is
in use please don't get rid of it and
subsequently if this page fault happens
access the same process object it's also
going to increment the reference count
it is not going to lock this object
because its path is different it is
going through this path in order to
service its page fault which is for a
completely
different page the whole point of having
this reference count is now if let's say
some other entity in the operating
system such as a process migration
facility that says I need to balance the
load on this multiprocessor by moving
some process from this processor to a
different one if it looks at this
process object will say well I cannot
touch this process object because it's
reference count is not 0 which means
that this process object is currently
servicing some requests locally and that
is the way we can we can ensure the
existence guarantee for this object and
integrity of this of this object and
that can allow us to get rid of
hierarchical locking and promote
concurrency for service activities that
can be provided by the operating system
for the same service but where there is
concurrency that is possible in this
case page fault service that can be
happening in parallel for independent
regions of the address space touched by
the threads that are running on the same
processor but executing on different
cores perhaps of the same processor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
