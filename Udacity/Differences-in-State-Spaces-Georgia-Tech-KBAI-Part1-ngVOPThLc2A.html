talk in terms of differences this chart
illustrates the differences between
different states and the gold state so
for example if the current state was
this one then this redline illustrates
the difference from the gold state so we
should pick an operator that will help
reduce the difference between the
current state and the goal state so the
reduction between the difference between
the current state and the goal state is
the end the application that the
operator is the means that's why it's
called a means and analysis at any given
state I'm going to pick an operator that
will help me reduce the difference
between the current state and the goal
state not in a way this problem is
similar the problem of pathfinding in
robotics where we have to design a robot
that could go from one point to another
point in some navigation space from my
office to your office for example if our
offices were in the same building there
too we would use the notion of distances
between offices here we using the notion
of distance in a metaphorical sense in a
figurative sense not in a physical sense
so I'll sometimes use a word difference
instead of distance but it's the same
idea we are trying to reduce a distance
or the difference but in our abstract
space so going back to our example of
going from this initial State to this
goal state I can look at the initial
state and see that there are three
differences between the initial state in
the goal state first a is on table here
but a should be on B B is on table here
but we should be unseen and third C is
on top of a here but C should be on top
on cable there so three differences here
in a number of operations are available
to us nine operations in particular let
us do an mean sense analysis we can
apply an operator that will put C on
table in which case the difference
between the new state and the goal state
will be two we could apply an operator
that will put C on top of B that in that
case you listen to in the current state
and the goal state will still be three
or we can apply the operator of putting
B on top of C in which case the distance
within the current state and the goal
state will be
notice the notion of reducing
differences now leads to two possible
choices one could go with this state or
with this one mean since analysis by
itself does not help an AI agent decide
between this course of action and that
course of action this is something that
we'll return to both a little bit later
in this lesson and even much more in
detail when we come to planning in this
course for now let us assume that we
choose the top course of action just
like David had done earlier so this
chart illustrates the path taken from
the initial state to the goal State
and the important thing to notice here
is that with each different move the
distance between the current state and
the goal state is decreasing from 3 to 2
to 1 to 0 this is why means-ends
analysis comes up with this path because
at each time it reduces the difference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
