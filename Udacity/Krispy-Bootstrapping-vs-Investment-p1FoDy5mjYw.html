bootstrapping versus investing in a
bootstrapping scenario you are in
control of what you're able to do right
now without looking anywhere else you
can immediately take action this very
second you pause this video and go and
take action if you're bootstrap if
you're investing well now you got to
think a little bit more carefully how
you're going to discuss what your goals
and ideas are you need to communicate
very clearly what it is you want what it
is you're doing and why this person or
group of people should give you money to
do it on the flip side negative aspects
of bootstrapping are if you are sitting
in a room that has nothing in it and
your arms are tied behind your back
you're bootstrapping round is over
that's very little you could actually do
and if you find yourself in a situation
where there really isn't anything that
you have at your disposal that can help
you bootstrap something you're kind of
stuck and that's where investment can
really be a lifesaver because you can
reach out to somebody or a group of
people for help who might have the
resources or that key element you need
to do that thing that will make your
business successful in this space</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
