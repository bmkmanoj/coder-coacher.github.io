here's a brief overview of the course in
Lesson one we'll ask you to go out and
take some photographs but we'll also
show you how to take photographs that
tell a story
sometimes one movie enough sometimes it
might be four or five photographs and

do a good job in lesson two time to

do a surprising construction one that
well guess what it'll really be
pleasurable and fun unexpected lesson
