are reaching a web portal such as Gmail
let's say for accessing your email in
fact while you're doing this a million
how the clients are doing exactly the
same thing trying to reach the web
portal through the IP network the
service that you're trying to reach may
be architected to direct your particular
requests to a specific site and the
architecture within that site may look
like this a whole bunch of servers may
be on the order of thousands or even
10,000 within a cold dark room
interconnected to one another through
perhaps a high bandwidth communication
backplane and also all of the servers
are connected to data stores for
processing requests that may be coming
in and the servers may optionally use
the backplane that allows them to talk
to one another for servicing any
particular requests any of the servers
may be able to handle an incoming client
request now in the generic picture that
I'm showing you here the load manager
that is sitting in between these servers
and the IP network redirects an incoming
client requests to one of the servers
the Chosin server may then process the
query and answer the client the role of
the load manager is to balance the
client traffic among all the server's
basically the load manager has to make
sure that no particular server is
overloaded one of the characteristics of
most of the giant scale services is that
these clients requests that are coming
in are all independent of one another
sometimes this is also called
embarrassingly parallel meaning that all
of these client requests can be handled
in parallel so long as it is enough
server capacity to meet all the incoming
requests so the role of the load manager
is to balance the client traffic and
redirect them to the server so that no
particular server is overloaded and all
of the server's get equally utilized in
servicing incoming requests the other
rest
possibility of the Lord manager is to
hide partial failures because when we're
talking about the scale of giant scale
services and the kind of computational
power that resides in the data center
for servicing these giant scale services
they are humongous there are 10,000
nodes and when they have so many nodes
compute nodes and data nodes and so on
it's not a question of if something will
fail but it is a question of when
something is going to fail so the load
manager has to make sure that it is
observing the state of the servers and
ensuring that the incoming client
requests are shielded from any such
failures that may happen internally
within a particular site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
