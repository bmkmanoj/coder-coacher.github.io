think you could make arguments for for
what might be the correct answer for
this quiz one of the things you might
say is that the right one is doing a
better job because it's fitting so many
more data points that it's easier to
describe the pattern in the data because
you just have more data and so you're a
little bit more certain that for example
if you kept collecting data something
weird wouldn't happen that would mess up
your fit so that's one argument you
could make another argument you could
make which I think is perfectly valid is
that they're about the same that
considering how much data you have for
each one each one's doing a pretty
reasonable job of fitting and look the
data is pretty comparable between the
two of them it's just that the one on
the right happens to have more data but
that if the trend continued on the left
that you would probably have the same
fit the point is though that there isn't
a huge difference between these two fits
that they're both generally describing
the patterns and the data appropriately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
