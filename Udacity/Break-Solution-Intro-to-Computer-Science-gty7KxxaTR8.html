equivalent and the reason for that is we
have our code here that has if false
false will never be true so we'll never
actually run the break we'll never reach
that code we'll just run the statement
again and we'll have the same thing that
we started with every time the test is
true we execute the statement the second
one is not equivalent and the reason for
that is the break will stop the loop so
if the loop would execute more than once
in this version if we go through the
loop twice in this case we can only ever
go through the statement once since
after we go through the statement once
we reach the break and then we're done
the third one is not equivalent so here
we're having a while true that will run
forever except for we have the break so
that would stop it the problem is the
test condition from the break is the
same as the test condition for the while
but it should really be the opposite in
the while we keep going as long as the
test condition is true the way I've
written the code here if the test
condition is true we stop so for this to
be equivalent what we should have
written instead would have taken the
opposite of the test condition so if we
had if not which changes true to false
and false to true then the test
condition then the break this would be
equivalent to the original loop what we
have is not the final one is the most
complicated and this one is actually
always equivalent to the original loop
and the reason for that is if we think
through the execution so in the original
loop if the test condition is true we
execute the statement s and then we keep
going and so if the test condition is
true the second time we execute s again
and we keep going if we look at what
happens here well if the test condition
is true we execute s then if the test
condition is true again we execute s and
then we keep going so that has the same
behavior we should trace it through the
case where the test condition is not
true so here if the test condition was
true we execute s if it's not true the
second time then we're done with the
loop and we continue in this case if the
test condition is true the first time
we'll execute s if it's not true the
second time then we would go to the else
so if it's not true we go to the else
then we go to the break
and the break gets out of the loop so we
have the same exact behavior where we
executed T once then we executed s then
we executed T we didn't execute s again
and we broke out of the loop to continue
so these two are equivalent
the other two are different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
