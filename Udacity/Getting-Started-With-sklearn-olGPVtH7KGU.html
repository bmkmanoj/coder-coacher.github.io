the end there so let's take a step back
and walk through what I just did but
much more slowly you're going to see all
the steps that I went through when I
wrote the Python code that just made
that decision boundary and by the end of
the next video or two you will be able
to write this code yourself so the place
that we start as always maybe is Google
so there's a Python library that I'm
going to be using a lot in this lesson
and we're going to be using Google to
help us use the documentation of that
library to figure out how to use some of
the functions that it has the name of
this library is scikit-learn which is
often abbreviated SK learn so let me get
you used to that convention now so I'm
going to search Google for SK learn and
the name of the algorithm that I just
used which happens to be naivebayes
we'll go back in a little bit and talk
about what naivebayes does exactly but
first I want you to have you running the
code so SK learn naivebayes
see what's out there there's a page on
naivebayes here it gives you a
derivation of the naive Bayes formula
and then a bunch of use cases including
something that says Gaussian naive Bayes
and as it turns out this is what I'm
going to be using so let's head back
because I saw Gaussian naive Bayes as
one of the other results on Google
that's this one Gaussian naive Bayes
this is the way that I actually wrote
classifier that you just saw</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
