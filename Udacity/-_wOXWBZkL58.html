20 but we can create a histogram with
any bin size are also called the
interval size this is interactive eight
histogram software which I really like
you can just input the data here and
then you can see how the shape of the
histogram changes when you change the
bin size so here we're getting bigger
and bigger bins and you see that there
are more observations now within each
interval if we keep making the bin size
bigger and bigger eventually it gets
kind of hard to see the shape of the
histogram because the bin sizes are too
big
so here the bin size is about 23 and if
we keep going of course eventually we
get way too much data in each bin and
the shape of the histogram isn't even
recognizable so let's get a smaller bin
size here you can kind of see better the
shape of the histogram that it peaks at
around age 20 and so it's really up to
you to decide what bin size you want and
it all depends on what questions you
want to answer how much detail do you
want because at some point the bin size
is probably too small but at some point
the bin size is probably too big in this
software you can also see that the
sample size is 50 you can see the
average and we're going to get to these
statistics later the link to this
software is on the right so you can
click on it and input the data we shared
this data with you in a Google
spreadsheet and then you can see for
yourself how the shape of the histogram
changes when you change the bin size</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
