implement the functions gets in casts
I'm in the file with our toy memcache
we've got our other functions set get
delete and cache is just a dictionary
which whose behavior mimics the memcache
for the most part what I'd like you to
do is implement gets and casts so gets
takes one parameter called key and it
returns a tuple of the value stored in
the cache and a hash of that value a
simple hash we can use is you can use
the built-in Python function hash on the
built-in function called wrapper on the
value repperton any Python object into a
string representation of it which will
work for our little test case here and
hash just returns a simple hash of that
of that string and if the value is not
in the cache you just return none now
cast is the more complicated function
this sets the key to equal value in our
cache and return true if the cache
unique matches the hash of the value
that's already in the cache if the cache
unique does not match the hash we don't
set anything and we return false if you
look down here we've got our test
functions the top few are the same ones
we had before and down here you can see
what we've we've got so here's setting X
to 2 and then we print gets X and this
is going to print two and then a hash
it's not gonna print the word hash it's
going to print a number and then we're
gonna call casts trying to set X to
three and in this case I'm going to send
in just zero which I know won't be the
hash and the cache should return false
and then if we run cast again with the
correct hash the one that was returned
from gets we should update the cache and
return true and if we print get X we
should see the value four because that's
what we set it to here okay good luck
with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
