make a persona now doing this can be one
of the most difficult and intimidating
thing that a designer has to do but it's
really useful so to try and keep this
very first persona is sort of simple and
straightforward as possible we're gonna
ask that you make it for yourself and
hopefully these two words are throwing
up a huge warning for you because it
almost sounds like we're asking you to
go down the path of designing for
yourself but we're not normally you do
not wanted to design yourself and you
won't be doing that here so why are we
asking you to do this for one thing we
hope this is an easy introduction to
creating a persona because it really can
be quite difficult for another what we
want to do is see the discussion form
with a bunch of authentic personas and
use cases and in the next question
you'll take the personas and use cases
created by your classmates for
themselves and build featureless and
flows for them we've created a template
impressi and there's a link to it below
that might help you out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
