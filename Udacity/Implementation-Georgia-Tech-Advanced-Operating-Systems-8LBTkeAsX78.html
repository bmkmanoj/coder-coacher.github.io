efficient implementation of our VM the
restricted semantics of transaction
helped a lot in making sure that what we
are designing as a reliable virtual
memory is not very heavyweight but the
implementation of that reduced semantics
has to be efficient as well and that's
part of the reason why this is called
lightweight reliable virtual memory to
indicate that it's lightweight in terms
of transactional properties now how to
make it really perform well the first
thing is the strategy that they use for
recording changes to the persistent
portion of the virtual memory the
routing strategy is what is called no
undo redo value logging no undo meaning
that we are creating an undo record of
the changes that we're going to make to
virtual memory but it is not a log that
is persisted on the disk it is just an
in-memory copy that is kept only for the
duration of the transaction and at the
end of the transaction either it commits
or abort
we throw away that undo copy that we
created on the other hand redo is the
log that we create
first of all in memory as a data
structure in our VM and we commit those
layers structure to memory and in
committing the changes of the redo logs
we are only writing the new value
records of committed transactions to the
log so even though the redo log consists
of a transaction start and the changes
that you're making only new value
records of the committed transactions
are written to the log now this is the
reason you have forward displacements
that we know word append to the log
segment on the disk there is an
in-memory version of the log segment to
which you're writing the redo logs and
once you've written the redo logs you're
flushing it to the disk on the disk you
have a on disk version of this video log
record for this particular process and
what you're doing at a commit point is
only writing the new value records of
the committed transactions at the tail
of the log segment so we're only
appending to that log segment the new
changes
that have been made within this
transaction so upon commit what we need
to do is we have to replace the old
value records in the virtual memory with
the new value records but this is
automatic because the way lrvm works is
that it has created an undo record of
the old value records of that portion of
the virtual address space and all the
changes that the developer is making to
the persistent data structures in memory
are happening in memory and therefore
replacing the old value records but the
new value records in the virtual memory
is automatic only if you abort you have
to undo the changes but if you're
committing then your virtual memory is
already ready to go in terms of the
changes that are being made within the
transaction at that point you have to
force the redo log records to the log on
the disk and as I mentioned earlier the
optimization that's available in the
implementation is to get transactions on
the cheap in particular the no restore
optimisation allows implementation not
to create an in-memory undo record
that's time saved in terms of copying
and that means better performance for
the application and similarly no flush
at commit point tells our VM that it can
write the redo log to the disk lazily
and does not have to block the process
that is making that call the end
transaction call and that is an
opportunity again to make that
implementation more performance
conscious so this lazy commitment of
course has its downside there is this
window of vulnerability that I mentioned
and that is there is a time window
between end transaction and the point at
which the redo log has been forced to
the disk and this is the window of
vulnerability and if the system crashes
within this time then we've lost the
redo records that we wrote to in memory
and that is important to understand that
there is a price you pay in order to get
this flexibility and performance in the
implementation you can see that this
riddle
data structure allows traversal in both
directions and this is for flexibility
in implementing the RVM runtime in
particular writing to the on disk
version of this video log having these
forward displacements allows you to know
where exactly you want to append to the
existing redo log record from the
changes that are being done in this
particular transaction and being
committed at this point of time and
similarly the reverse displacements are
helpful in traversing the log record
during recovery</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
