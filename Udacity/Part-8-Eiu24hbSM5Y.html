exception because we know that every
time I well I just do it and we
mentioned that line 34 prints the wrong
yeah its texture yeah sorry I didn't you
need them make a note of that though
okay who's checking me into crazy Hobbit
recorder major major our majors are what
we had the not equal to Sentinel that
needs to change we're not checking for a
period or have the exception every
character in the new line is intent ok
that's pretty there's questions about
where the loop even terminate and now
we're cleaning the wrong beer okay I
shouldn't catch can are we going to you
know catch be on its own line or catch
comes after you know online 36 there
should should we serve we want to talk
about a standard for that I personally
like this style I mean I think this is
the new style or whatever I like this
like this were the opening curly brace
is on the same line and then the close
curly brace on I show you a crazy Bob
and I talked about that a lot and we
thought that there was a nice way to put
the code and again if we want to define
a standard is different I can do it
static sub coding were discussed between
the two of you just that's interesting
well as you know we're talking about how
ADA you know eight it doesn't even use
these curly braces i mean we could do
begins and ends and then it's really
clear exactly where these blocks are
beginning and ending we wouldn't be
having all these crazy java problems of
it you crazy bob is from pre Civil War
era so we have you need to be careful
when you listen to him I know one thing
has bothered me I keep looking at this
thing is that here's a piece of code
you're claiming that you ruin it but
there's no header in this code that says
this is dr. Boggs the revision of the
code any of that kind information which
is typical in software engineering that
we know whose it is how its revised of
other people been making new versions of
it we know who they are with the dates
of each revision original development
art etc none of that is in here so the
10 years from now the maintainer can
call you up in the middle of the night
and asked you what you were thinking
well I forget the nominal bugs in this
but there's no job at a bug you out 10
javed on this case it might be
appropriate that you also put the
sources of the different places you
visited the copy and paste of code it
might be okay that was just a minor I
mean I really copied a couple of things
not too much but that's a sure I mean
I'd like the while statement that's
incorrect malavita told you before the
wild state perception and your name is
stated like mega point has been making
very good talk about continue please
okay so at this point yeah they came
back the line 36 i believe it's improper
to catch just a generic exception you're
supposed to catch the most exception
you're actually expecting generic except
catching generic exceptions is catching
generic exceptions that's just a cover
your behind kind of thing I'm sorry I
rather than actually trying to catch
ioexception zai believe this should be I
owe exception I was just trying to be
comprehensive because you know this way
any exception that happens will be
caught miesha lee cake will realize
system without printing anything is also
really bad i mean we should be writing
to the lager in the case where the
exception was raised yeah night in case
they're scepter was really good issue
I'd call that definitely a major both of
them I know if my colleagues agree with
that or not so we need to catch specific
and I have a generic catch that follows
is that were saying but we just catch
the ones we were actually expecting
what about the ones that we don't expect
we're not we won't get any information
about those always well you know if we
were using either they have a catch-all
at the end that we could always tell
you're not with these either stuff I
think we're using Java and so we'll have
to deal with that again I think we
should make that also part of the coding
standards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
