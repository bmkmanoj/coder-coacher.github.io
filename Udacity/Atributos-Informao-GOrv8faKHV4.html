take away from this discussion is that
features and information are two
different things
what you really want out of your data is
information you want to be able to draw
conclusions and have insights and that's
not strictly speaking the same thing as
having lots of features in the data so
the feature is the actual number or
characteristic of a particular data
point that's attempting to access
information but it's not exactly the
same as information itself so for
example it's a little bit like the
difference between the quantity of
something in the quality if you have
lots of features you might have a lot of
quantity of data the quality of those
features is the information content so
in general what you want is the bare
minimum number of features that it takes
to give you as much information as
possible if there's a feature present
that isn't giving you information you
want to get rid of it because it can
cause all of those problems that we were
talking about in the last video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
