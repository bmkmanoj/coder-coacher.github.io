another category of reports that come
out of your genome and those are called
inherited conditions and those include
things like cystic fibrosis and bloom
syndrome and sickle cell anemia oh well
I i know i'm not a carrier for sickle
cell anemia but that makes sense because
i have a mainly European background and
sickle cell anemia isn't prevalent of
those with European descent however in
sub-saharan Africa it is more prevalent
and you guys may remember Kagura who's
from Kenya a cookery is anyone in your
family ever been affected by sickle cell
anemia no no one in my family has been
affected by sickle cell anemia but I am
aware of people around me who padded
okay well when we go take a look at your
results to see if it by any chance
you're a carrier sounds good okay great
alright so now that we've logged into
your profile cookery we need to go up to
my results and look for the inherited
condition section and what is it safe
where you could gory let's find it
scroll down until you find the sickle
cell anemia report yeah is that it this
is it here what does it say it says
variant absent your answer what does
that mean Joanna so that means that you
do not carry one of the variants that's
linked to sickle cell anemia so now
we're looking at the report itself and
there's some background information that
scroll down to find your actual results
and then we see it doesn't mean it says
you do not have the S version of the hbb
gene which is linked to sickle cell
anemia okay so it says here that a
person with one copy of the S version
typically does not have sickle cell
anemia but can pass the mutation to
offspring so does that mean that the SL
eel is dominant or recessive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
