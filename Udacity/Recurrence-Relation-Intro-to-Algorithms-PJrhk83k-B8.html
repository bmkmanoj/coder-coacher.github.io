with a template for a recursively
generated graph if the template says if
we want one node we just return a single
node for other values make a g1 and the
g2 that are half the size and then we
make login connections between g1 and g2
by picking a random point and connecting
it with a random node another random
node and connecting it with the random
node etc and then we turn so this has
the recurrence relationship that when we
have one node we have 0 edges and if we
have n nodes we get 2 times the number
of nodes we have for a graph of half the
size plus big theta of log in and so
what we want you to do is to solve this
recurrence but we're gonna do this one a
little differently than some of our
previous homework assignments instead of
a multiple-choice question we want you
to explain how to actually solve this so
below there's a forum link and at that
link you'll see this question restated
what we want you to do is write up your
answer post in response to the forum get
the link for your answer and then insert
it here I'll give an example to make
this more clear so here's the question
on the forum and you should write up
your answer some possible answers might
be that T of n is theta log in theta n
log n theta of n theta of N squared
there's any other function and then you
should explain why you've answered like
this or just submit your answer
hit the link button copy of the link now
