into bugs and these little critters are
dead set on breaking your app and much
like cockroaches in Florida there's just
no avoiding them there's going to be
times in this development process where
your code isn't going to work and you're
you're not going to have any idea why
and you're going to get incredibly
frustrated and you might even want to
throw your computer out the window don't
do that seriously one tiny bug is not
worth thousands of dollars when I'm in
these situations I find the best thing
is to just walk away I mean not forever
just for like a few hours or maybe even
a day but I go do something else they
watch TV or I grab a drink with a friend
or go for a run or something to clear my
mind and take a mental break and I find
that when I come back it's a lot easier
to both find and solve the problem that
I was having before now that's not the
only way to deal with these types of
situations let's go check back in with
our pros and see their advice for
dealing with bugs and other issues in
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
