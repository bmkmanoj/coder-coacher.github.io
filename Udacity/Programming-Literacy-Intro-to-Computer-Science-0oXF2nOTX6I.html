different in world where almost everyone
who's programming literate so this is a
cool question and obviously I feel that
it would be great to have such a world
that's why we're trying to encourage as
many people as possible to take this
class I hope you'll encourage any non
programming literate people that you
know to take the next version of this
class starting in April there are lots
of things that understanding programming
even at just a basic level and I think
many of you are beyond the basic level
now if you've made it this far in CS 101
but in terms of the things that you
interact with and the things that you
see in the world almost all of them are
controlled by programs these days and
people who understand programming can
relate to those things in a better way
than people would do and some of this
can be started fairly obvious things
when you interact with a website and you
can tell well they've got some bug in it
because the programmer didn't think
about both branches of the NIF test and
if you're a programmer at least
understand about programming um that you
maybe have a better sense of what's
going on but you also can get a lot more
annoyed by it because you know well this
is something any programmer who knows
what they're doing should have tested
for and understand what's going on and
its really annoying that you have to
deal with their mistake other things you
probably have a better understand of how
complicated is and how hard it is to get
things right that you might be a little
more forgiving when things break and
have better ideas about well this is
probably why he's breaking let's try to
use this tool or use this product in
some slightly different way so that's
one of the reasons the other reason I
think is there are lots of things that
people encounter every day that if you
know a little bit about programming
instead of doing a lot of tedious work
as a human you can find a way to
automate that and save yourself a lot of
so there's a good example of this right
here in our office so when recording
these videos we generate hundreds every
week to get the classes out for all
these courses and they're all named kind
of default things by the video camera
you know video XXX one two four whatever
but what we need to do to edit them is
organize them by like date and time of
course and whatnot so one of our video
editors wrote script with just kind of
the programming that you got
a little bit previously to do this
automatically whenever we record videos
we just give it to her and she sorts out
automatically and saves the video
editors hours of time okay that's great
and I think people once you get a little
experience with her you'll see things
like that every day that you're seeing
people um could be yourself but it'll
less often be yourself spending their
time doing tedious things that are not
fun for humans that you could write a
few lines of Python code to solve and so
I hope at the end of this class and I
think by this point of the class many of
you really should be at the level where
instead of just solving the problems
that we're giving you in the homeworks
you're finding real problems in your
life and in your friends lives that you
can solve by writing a little bit of
code so I hope everyone will be doing
that and spreading the value of
programming literacy beyond the beyond
just yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
