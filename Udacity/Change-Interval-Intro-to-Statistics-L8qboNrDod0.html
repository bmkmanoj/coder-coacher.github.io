example and which we be applying
statistical techniques for problems of
important significance in stock trading
so here is a stock price for a specific
day in 2010 and the company were
discussing is Apple which on the day
started trading just above $250 but in
the afternoon the stock when all of a
sudden down to 200 dollars back to the
original price as a statistician we are
concerned about this because if you make
trained decisions based on what's
happening we might lose millions or
billions of dollars this is a one in a
decade abnormal behavior and as a
statistician we might care about writing
software that finds these kind behaviors
so we stopped trading we'd all fall into
the trap of selling our stock at a
unfortunate rate just because something
really really strange is happening and
that's a real example of which people
lost millions if not billions of dollars
so in a typical trading day Apple stock
traded about 70,000 times giving us 70
thousands of data points of prices
during the day what we be looking at is
the percentage change between adjacent
trades which we call delta T and let's
defined as the difference between two
consecutive trading points XT plus 1
minus XT normalized by XT so normally if
XT and XT plus 1 is the same this will
be 0 if there's a big difference then
this is a larger value and we know for
the day in question what the mean and
the standard deviation is for this
percentage change the mean is as small
as 0.0007 for negative in percent so we
leave off the percent is even 100 times
smaller and this is the value for the
standard deviation zero point zero one
three four four percent my first
question for you is to compute the
confidence interval assuming that we can
use a confidence interval to detect
outliers in the data if you assume a
symmetrical confidence interval with
five percent confidence in our magic
factor the percentile is 1.96 compute
for me in percent the confidence
interval for the variable delta T</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
