technology can you reflect any on what
change its meant to people as they're
confronted with developing a new
application do they think about the
architecting of it now any differently
than they did in the past certainly when
we build new instances of the forecaster
right it changes dramatically how we
think about configuring that because now
there's a lot more structure in place
based on the existence of layer box
itself and these assembly specifications
to allow us to to plan for a new
configuration of this capability and and
to divvy up the parts when when
executing it in terms of new
capabilities I think it's been a mixed
bag in the sense of I think that people
often find it very difficult to come up
with the right abstractions initially so
even with layer blocks and with this
this approach kind of in the in the bag
of tools we often don't immediately
think when we have a new problem to
solve that it's going to be a product
line right or there's that it's that
this is a the right way to solve it and
I don't know what to do about that
perhaps if if if we got better at kind
of a priori feature analysis it would be
more obvious or perhaps maybe you have
to to build one or two products you know
in a product line to recognize that you
have a product line there to begin with
it's I'm not really sure I think it's
still kind of an open question but
that's been our experience today the
other thing I'd like to ask you is for
the benefit of the students who might
want to become software architects do
you have any reflection on the
relationship between kind of the
academic knowledge that you learn about
software design software architecture
and what what you have to confront in
the real world would doing software
architecture so let me think of a few
things that it's all over the map I've
found that in the in the last seven
years I've used just about every
that I've learned in a software
engineering course that at the time
seemed very abstract and perhaps I
thought I'd never use this I do let me
try to become create about things I've
found that are definitely useful skills
so maybe the biggest one for me is well
too one is data modeling be it data
modeling using ER or arm or UML or
whatever getting really good at modeling
the at a conceptual level the structure
of data in a system if you're going to
build any kind of system like the ones
I'm just mentioning that is a really
critical skill and even though it's
taught pretty well in database courses
and a lot of people take database
courses you'd be amazed at just how rare
it is to be really good at that so
getting facility and data modeling and
not applying it just a database design
but to to any kind of information design
problem at all is I found it extremely
useful and to really pay dividends I've
also found it really useful to to get
really comfortable with many different
models of software composition because
you just never know when one might be
useful and they often are so I when when
I was a student at georgia tech i spent
a lot of time learning how to use
process algebra and you know CSP fsp
low-dose that there's a whole family of
these action languages that were very
interesting to me and we covered them in
classes and we learn how to use them and
they had very nice compositional
capabilities that they were very elegant
and very clean and very well studied but
it wasn't really clear how to use them
you know in something you there was not
a compiler that you wouldn't write
programs in this language to use to
build a big piece of system but over
time I found that they come back a lot
in fact we've started using them in
logic box to as the basis for building a
batch automation framework where you've
got this problem of designing workflows
and you have to compose them and you
need to compose them using a small
number of very clearly defined operators
and doing a clean
being able to reason about it so things
like that have been very useful petri
nets which I studied many many years ago
and also seemed like a nice elegant way
to think about concurrency and data
flows and workflows again it's not
immediately obvious how to just take
that and use it but you'll find that
they'll inspire designs that you'll see
in the future and there'll be just the
right thing when you run into some some
architectural problem what are some
others any kind of algebraic approach to
thinking about software composition I
think that maybe is the underlying theme
if you can um if you can understand nice
clean elegant models of software
composition what are their properties
when are they useful how can you use
them to inspire designs you'll find that
a lot of infrastructure work that you do
tends to be better by having been
inspired by these these ideas that have
been worked out by a lot of very smart
people over many years rather than
trying to come up with it yourself and I
guess maybe the last thing I'd say is a
segue from that and that is this this is
not something that we tend to do very
well generally as software developers
but knowing a body of related work and
when you start a new problem try to
relate your problem to a problem that's
already been seen because chances are
someone has solved it or solve some very
intimate that you can heavily borrow
from I think that's huge and I think
that that's maybe the biggest piece of
advice I would give to a budding
software architecture so so what I'm
hearing is the world is filled with with
all kinds of complex problems and the
more weapons you can bring it appear to
to to solving them the more likely yard
to be able to get a handle on that
complexity Andy Andy what will occur
this this has been a wonderful wonderful
story you have to tell about this and
I'm glad that you were able to apply
some of your your you know academic
background to solving it and I just want
to thank you very much for for conveying
that story to the to the class now
you're very welcome and thanks for the
opportunity to tell the story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
