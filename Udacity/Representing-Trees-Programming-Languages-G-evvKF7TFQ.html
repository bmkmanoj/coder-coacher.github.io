trees should work in theory let's talk
about how we might implement them in
Python looking just at the top note of
this tree it has three important parts
the content the number or name that I'm
storing there and then the left and the
right children coming out however we can
also see that some nodes have no
children may not have a left or a right
child let's use a very simple and direct
approach for encoding these trees or
representing them in Python will use
tuples will have a 32 pole where the
three parts correspond exactly to my
value the current content the left child
and the right child some nodes have no
children will use none in Python to
represent that so this seven node would
look like this a seven with no left
child and no right child in this
complete tree will be a much bigger
nested tuple at the top level it's one
tuple with three parts a big left child
5 my current value and a big right child
and the left child and the right child
also follow exactly the same layout and
we had suggested earlier that in
computer science this is often called a
recursive data structure my tree this
five is made up of or contains smaller
instances of itself smaller instances
that follow the same sort of pattern so
now let's get some concrete practice
coding this up in Python let's try to
write a procedure insert that takes one
of these trees and a new element and
returns a new tree including that
element just like you did in the quiz so
I'll just set things up insert takes a
tree in an element and this is going to
be a recursive procedure all the cool
procedures are recursive and the base
case is actually inserting into the
empty tree if you don't give me anything
to work with I'll just make a new
singleton tree containing only this
element that looks like this a singleton
tree just a single branch has no left
child no right child and the element
right in the center if the tree is not
none then it has a left child a current
element and a right
mild and what we want to do is compare
the element to be inserted against the
element we found here and that will tell
us whether we should insert it into the
left or insert it into the right I'm
going to do this in two steps if the
element to be inserted is less than or
equal to what we're currently looking at
then we're going to call ourselves
recursively going down into the left so
i'm going to call insert on the left
child and try to insert the same element
into it and that's going to return a new
tree a new minor typo left child I'll
just build up a new tree that has the
new left child the same element that was
here already and the old right child
unchanged we never even have to look in
the right child we can ignore that half
of the tree that's a phenomenal cosmic
boost to speed this is an efficient data
structure when done well otherwise we're
going to do mostly the same thing on the
right so here's a quiz for you what
should go in this blank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
