how we actually get a breast tumor the
epidemiological data shows that if you
have a normal bracket one there's about
a twelve percent risk of having breast
cancer whereas if you have this 5380 to
insertion of cytosine in the bracket one
coding region you end up with about a
sixty percent risk of breast cancer now
what's actually happening here Braca one
when there's a fully functional protein
is able to repair DNA damage right we
said its normal function is to actually
maintain genetic stability in a Cell and
it helps to fix certain kinds of
mutations this insertion of a cytosine
causes a frameshift which does change a
lot of amino acids but it also probably
is going to end up with a stop codon
earlier than expected which will
truncate or shorten the protein and its
overall function is going to be
disrupted because it can't carry out its
function of fixing these mutations
inside the cell those mutations can
persist cause other problems and
eventually turn into a tumor so now our
risk is elevated to about sixty percent
so how does a bracket one protein
normally repair mutations that it finds
in breast tissue cells well you'll
remember from lesson six we learned that
there are induced mutations that can
come from many places including x-ray
energy can actually Nick the DNA
backbone and literally cut a DNA strand
in half like this remember this is bad
news bears this is like separating a
chromosome this is not good a cell needs
to fix this quickly Braca one is a
critical protein that's able to get
these two broken strands of DNA back
together again of course it has the help
of a lot of other proteins as well but
as long as Braco one is functioning
efficiently with all the other proteins
then we can actually fix this mutation
and we get our DNA strand glued back
together so although there are other
backup repair mechanisms without a fully
functioning Braca one the DNA has a
higher chance of going unrepaired and
eventually enough mutations occur that
could cause the cells to grow out of
control and form of tumor thus your risk
for breast cancer with the brca1
mutation is much higher so based on this
function for
Waka one what would you expect this 5380
to insertion of cytosine the frameshift
mutation to be dominant or recessive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
