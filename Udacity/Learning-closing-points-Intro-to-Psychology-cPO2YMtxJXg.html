reflexive responses such as salivation
eyeblink and startled responses
unconditioned stimuli automatically
elicit unconditioned responses after
pairing a neutral stimulus with an
unconditioned stimulus classical
conditioning occurs and the neutral
stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus
elicits a conditioned response
remember Pavlov and his dogs operant
conditioning was described by BF Skinner
and he said that we operate on our
environment and behaviors are selected
due to their consequences positive and
negative reinforcement produce an
increase in the future frequency of a
behavior whereas positive and negative
punishment produce a decrease in the
future frequency of a behavior
unconditioned reinforcers like food sex
and water and unconditioned Punishers
like pain are effective with no prior
learning history however conditioned
reinforcers like money or grades and
conditioned Punishers like harsh words
are effective because of a pairing
process social learning involves
learning by watching the consequences of
somebody else's behavior if we see
somebody being rewarded for doing
something we may be more likely to do
that as well if we want to be rewarded
also the same is true for consequences
that are negative remember the Bobo doll
experiments these are examples of social
learning our learning is a function of
all these processes classical
conditioning operant conditioning and
social learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
