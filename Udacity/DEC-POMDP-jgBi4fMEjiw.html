the expansion of what it stands for
decentralized partially observable
Markov decision and then I kind of ran
out of space
yeah the P doesn't matter but you know
but you know it's a palm DP
decentralized palm DP and so so the
quantities that define the deck palm DP
are very similar to the quantities that
define upon DP we've got a set of states
transitions rewards observations and
observation function the major
difference is that actions are actually
taken simultaneously by a finite set of
agents there isn't just one driver
there's actually a whole you know too
many MCS really not enough mics well
done there's a set of agents who
actually get have some say over how the
transitions works so we're gonna say
capital I is that finite set of agents
actions available to an agent is a sub
the lie for agent I and the transition
function is is a function of the joint
actions taken by all the agents
simultaneously so instead of just going
from a state to a next state through an
action this is actually you could think
of it as a vector with one action for
each of the agents in our set okay so it
really is very similar kind of kind of
quantity but but we break up where the
actions are happening they have to be
happen happened jointly and the agents
themselves their observations about the
environment are also distributed in a
sense the age you know agent I gets to
gets to see something that's a function
of the agent and the state of the world
mm-hmm
alright so this is a model this in this
model that all the agents are acting
cooperatively because there's one shared
reward function that everybody gets if
we actually split the reward function so
there's a different one for each of the
agents we get yet another model that I'm
not going to talk about caught a
partially observable stochastic game or
pause mmm pause pause I'm positive that
would be interesting yeah yeah so we
could posit this discussion at this
point and have a side discussion more
puns the P stands for puns so this makes
sense and sounds great as a formalism
goes but I'm kind of a I'm struck when
you brought up the stochastic games
thing I was thinking the whole time this
sounds
game theory stuff oh yeah yeah right
it's sort of clearly game theory when we
have separate reward functions because
every agent has its own personal
interests but this is right so the deck
pom DP setup is a kind of common
interest game might be a word for it the
notion that there's agents acting
independently but they're all acting for
the same reward so we could model this
is game theory or it's just like some
different way of thinking about it it's
partway between game theory and pom DPS
yeah it has elements of both and in fact
I guess it's subsumes both so you can
represent any pom DP as the deck pom BP
was just one agent and you can represent
any common interest game as the deck pom
DP with you know complete observability
or maybe no states that sort of thing
