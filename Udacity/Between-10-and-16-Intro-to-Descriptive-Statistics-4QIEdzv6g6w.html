10 and 16 fall in the distribution 10 is
three points less than the mean and 16
is three points greater than the mean so
if this is the mean 13 this is 10 and
here's 16 we're looking for the area in
between those two how might we figure
this out well what we'll do is we'll
find the area under 16 and then we'll
subtract the area less than 10 so what's
the area less than 16 first let's
convert 16 to a z-score 16-13 / 4.8 so
this is 0 point 6 25 since 10 is
equidistant from 13 as 16 is then the
z-score for 10 is going to be negative
point 6 25 you can go ahead and
calculate that if you want sometimes
that helps things make more sense so
let's find the area less than a z-score
of point 6 25 will find 0.6 in the
vertical column and we'll have to round
to the hundredths place since that says
detailed as the z-table gets so we'll
around 20 point 63 so that's this column
and we should get points 7 3 5 7 and
then we'll subtract the area less than
10 which has a z-score of negative point
6 25 so here's negative point 6 and
here's the column 4.03 so the area less
than negative point 6 3 is 0 point two
six four three notice that since these
are the same values just ones positive
and one is negative then the area less
than point 6 25 plus the area less than
point negative 6 25 adds to one so
basically this area here plus this area
here equals one that's because the area
here is equal to the area here so if you
add point seven three five seven and
point two six four three you should get
one so that's just a property of the
symmetry of the normal distribution so
if we subtract them we get point four
seven one four and that's the area here
in between
10 and 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
