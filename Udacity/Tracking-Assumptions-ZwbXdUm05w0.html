use this model of motion to make these
predictions and there are two goals
right goal number one is that we can do
less work because of this because we
have some idea of where the object is
going to be we can restrict our search
goal number two is we should be able to
actually improve our estimates because
we're using both predictions based upon
dynamics and our measurements now to do
this we're going to make certain
assumptions okay and the assumptions
basically come down to the notion that
this is some form of continuous motion
we're going to assume that objects don't
disappear and reappear instantly
somewhere else for those of you child
psychology that's a whole Piaget thing
kids don't come to that belief until I
don't know it's like year and a half or
something like that so like kids who are
really little if you take a toy truck
and you've got a screen here and you put
the toy truck behind the screen and then
you lift up the screen and the truck's
not there anymore they're not surprised
things disappear in their universe all
the time or it becomes a carrot they're
not surprised either then all of a
sudden they get to a certain age when
the truck comes back if you pick it up
and it's a carrot they're like whoa all
right and that requires a certain change
in a mental model okay i don't know why
i mention that it's just really cool
it's true by the way not the piaget is
all true but that's true about children
anyway so we're going to make our
assumption in our tracking that that the
things don't just appear disappear we're
also making an assumption that the
camera doesn't move instantaneously you
know because that would be the same
thing right if I instantly went from
here to here right a big change things
will have violated my apparent
continuous motion so that's basically
that there's this gradual change in pose
between the camera and the scene and the
object</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
