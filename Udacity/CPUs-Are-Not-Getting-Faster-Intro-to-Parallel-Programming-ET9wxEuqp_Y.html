little bit so ten years ago when if I
wanted a faster computer than what I
would do was wait six months and then
the clock speed of the CPU is I could
buy would be thirty percent higher than
it was and I'd go down to the local
store and buy a new faster processor and
and that was largely determined by just
a faster clock that I'd go from one to
two to three gigahertz that's not
happening anymore
how come yes that's interesting so a lot
of people refer to that scaling and CPU
performance as Moore's law which is a
little bit of a misnomer Moore's law
really predicts a growth rate in the
number of devices you can fabricate on a
chip and Moore's law is actually alive
and well we can still every generation
of technology fabricate more devices on
a semiconductor chip that's still
growing exponentially what stopped
around 2005 was what's called Dennard
scaling which was scaling the voltages
that we operate our chips at as we
scaled the dimensions that we make the
transistors Matt and this stopped
because a weakened current in the
devices and without going to technically
into it what that meant is that now when
we get a new generation of chip let's
say we reduce the line widths by from
say unit to 0.7 of whatever that unit
was and the recent jump is from 28
nanometers to 20 nanometers when we do
that we now get twice as many devices in
the same amount of area in the old days
we would scale the voltage by 0.7 and
since the power goes as CV squared C
would go by 0.7 the voltage would go by
0.7 squared we wind up with the I should
say energy goes to C V squared we would
wind up with the energy of switching a
device being about a third of what it
was before the square root of eight and
and so we'd get this 3x improvement in
sort of a perf per watt of a basic unit
and then you could take that and use it
in various ways and one of the ways we
used it was to crank clock rate up so so
now that's not happening anymore now
that we're holding voltage constant
we're getting a little bit of energy
gain from the you know point seven in
capacitance but even that we're not
really getting the whole point settled
we're getting maybe half of that so we
get there perhaps in a generation of
technology a you know 50
percent improvement in in the basic
underlying technology so that's why you
can't take the same old serial processor
and just have it go faster anymore
you're not going to get any of the
frequency improvement frequencies have
largely flattened out you get more
parallelism but it's not it's no longer
that you know factor of three each
generation that you used to get it's now
you know perhaps you know you know
fifteen percent or so before you start
applying architecture and circuit
innovations if you just relied on
process that's all you would get even
though each one of those transistors is
a little smaller and sucks up a little
less power that's not nearly enough to
change the fact that you're making these
bigger and more parallel every
generation that's right well the better
way to think about it is suppose you got
the whole point seven on capacitance in
that scaling that means you now sort of
our thirty percent less energy so you
can now put thirty percent more units on
you would only grow thirty percent more
parallelism in an in a power constrained
environment on that same guy and you
could take that thirty percent either in
clock rate or in in more units although
it's harder to take in clock rate
because that's scaling is less is less
linear now you don't get the whole
thirty percent you may get half of that
for various reasons but that's what
you're getting to play with each each
generation until you start innovating
and that's why it's actually kind of fun
to be a computer architect these days
because that's where the value is it
used to be largely in process and so
companies that had our proprietary
process had had kind of an advantage and
they still have a little bit of an
advantage but that advantage has really
shrunk since process matters less these
days and what you do with the process
the architecture and circuits and and
programming systems matters a lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
