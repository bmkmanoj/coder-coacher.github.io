learned that there are four major ABO
blood groups we have blood group a B a B
and O now we saw the breakdown of these
blood type groups in the US population
but what's really intriguing is that
this describes what we see on the
surface of the red blood cells when you
go to the clinic they'll tell you what
what's on your blood cell do you have a
type B type a and B on your cell or no
type at all
o type but you have two alleles for the
ABO gene two possibility you could be
two A's or two B's or an A and a B or
maybe you're an A and an O right and
depending on those combinations together
that will result in which blood type you
are I want you to tell me what the
possible allele combinations are for
each of these different blood type
groups I'll help you out with the first
one and give you an example - B blood
type a we could have 2a alleles or we
could have an A allele and an O allele
because the O allele wouldn't produce
anything right we get nothing but the a
olio would put the a antigen or the a
carbohydrate on the surface of our red
blood cells because the a allele codes
for the ABO protein that will make and
put the a carbohydrate on the surface of
red blood cells so these are the only
two possible allele combinations we
could have I want you to fill that in
for these other three options here and
see if you can come up with the correct
allelic combinations separate each
combination with a comma and also
remember that the order of the alleles
doesn't matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
