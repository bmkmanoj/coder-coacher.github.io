and in this first question we're going
to go over how to reason about the state
of a chart when parsing a token in a
given grammar so right here I have a
grammar that identifies javascript
function calls let's say I have a
function pow which computes the power of
a number to another number it doesn't
really matter so the idea is that this
function computes five to the six but
what we care about is the tokens right
here and to show that this string is in
this grammar we're going to walk through
it so here I've written our first
starting role which goes to ID some
parentheses and then optional arguments
so the ID in this case is pal and then
we have two parentheses and the optional
arguments in the case for example is
five and six we don't have to have
anything here as the title implies it's
optional I could go right to the empty
string but we do have arguments in this
case we're going to have some kind of
expression or an expression followed by
karma with more arguments and in this
case we have to so the optional
arguments goes to arguments it's not
empty so it's going to go to this rule
and then from arguments we're going to
go to this role where expression is
going to be five we have the comma that
matches our comma the rest of the role
it's going to be ours which goes to
since this is our last argument is just
going to go straight to expression which
is six and we were able to match this
string to the grammar using the set of
replacement rules given so I just went
through that to demonstrate how this
grammar matches javascript function
calls but that's not really what the
question is asking the question is
asking about the chart and we're going
to see what happens when we parse a
certain set of tokens so instead of at
writing the actual string i just have
the tokens that matter and for the sake
of parsing that's all we care about this
can be matched by what I had before but
all we care about is the tokens now when
we parse this what we want to ask is
what is in chart to the third entry in
our chart and so we're given the set of
rules that may be in the chart and I'm
just going to go through them real quick
so here's your choices and we're trying
to figure out as a reminder what's in
the second entry in our chart when we
part
this list of tokens in this grammar
since we're asking a question we should
remember question marks so there's
really two ways to solve this the first
is you work out the sharp by hand and
that's what we're going to do because
it's easy to kind of explain what's
going on an alternative which is equally
valid is to take the code that we wrote
in lecture and modify it to print the
chart at every given state this is
probably what you want to do if you were
asked this question more than once but
like I said for the sake of going of the
answer we're going to work it out by
hand okay here's your input here's our
grammar and we want to know what's in
charge zero anything in yet so we're
just going to be at the beginning of
this start substitution rule and we
introduce this in chart state 0 so now
we're in short one and we've read in one
token ID and we're just going to shift
on this role this ID is the first token
in this role this comes from 0 as well
so now the moment of truth chart to
let's see what we can do so we're going
to see the token that's the left for NC
and we're going to shift so here there's
two things that are possible one is that
optional arguments is empty we don't
know yet because we haven't seen the
rest of the input token list in that
case we're going to be passed optional
arguments there's also the case where
are you optional arguments isn't empty
which is actually what's going on with
our input list so let's write both those
out here we've moved past option
arguments presumably because it's empty
by this role right here then we have the
other choice we're optional arguments is
not empty and we're going to be
processing it so regarding this first
ran out role in our chart we have the
option arguments being empty so we need
to make sure to add that we introduce
this in charge state to we have the
other case where option arguments is not
empty and we're going to go through arch
now so I've written out both artists
rules and since we haven't read in this
next token we don't have anything to go
further on in either roll so at the
beginning of each rule and presumably
the next charge date we will shift over
with the new regular within
expression so now we have everything we
need to answer the question we're just
going to check off the choices that were
in our chart stay too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
