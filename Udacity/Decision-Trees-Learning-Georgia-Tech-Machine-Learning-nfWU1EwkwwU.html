try to write down exactly what it is
that you did and going through 20
questions to get your answer to discover
Michael Jackson was a person I was
thinking about so what was the very
first thing you did I tried to imagine a
bunch of possible answers that you could
be could have in mind and I tried to
think of a question that would help
separate them into two roughly equal
chunks okay so what's a way of putting
that in the language that we've been
using for supervised learning and
classification so far oh I see so if I
had known in advance here's here's 200
things that you might ask me about and
what their what their attribute values
are what would be a question that would
split that set in half right so instead
of just imagining a bunch of things if I
actually had a list which I do in the
case of a training set all right so the
first thing you did is you pick the best
attributes you could think of and by the
way you said something very particular
here you've actually defined what best
is you said that best is the same thing
as splitting things roughly in half so
let's revisit that in a moment okay so
the first thing you did is you pick the
best attribute you asked the question
about it and then depending upon the
answer you went and pick another
attribute right that seemed fair yeah
okay so we think about decision tree is
a way of talking about that is that you
follow the path of the answer and then
lather rinse and repeat
you went back and pick the best
attribute ask the question follow the
answer path so on and so on and you kept
doing that until what until I narrowed
the space of possibilities to in this
case just one item right so until you
got to the answer right and that is an
algorithm so you pick the best attribute
and you actually define what best
attribute was you wanted to pick one
that would somehow eliminate at least
half of the things that you might worry
about and keep the other half in play
you asked the specific
question you follow the path to that and
then you went back and you picked
another attribute and so on and so forth
until you got an answer that you wanted
to that's an algorithm and that's an
algorithm that we might use to actually
build a decision tree and the only
difference between what you did and what
you would do with learning a decision
tree is that since you don't know in
advance what the answer actually is
going to be because you don't know what
specific object I might be thinking of
you have to actually follow all possible
paths at each time and think of all
possible best next attributes until you
completely can answer any question that
makes sense
I see so right so instead of just
playing the game interactively I kind of
imagined all possible ways to go and
build that whole flowchart the whole
tree right so let's see if we can do
that with some pictures and I actually
want to decide whether I really believe
your definition of best okay
sure all right so let's do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
