functions graft over here on this
coordinate plane and here i have y
equals x to the fourth graft as well i'd
like you to take a second and compare
the overall behavior of x to the fourth
to x squared and now that all three of
these graphs actually go through the
origin which makes sense because zero
taken to any power is just equal to zero
so we plug in 0 for X and any of them
the Y value is going to be zero as well
however both of the graphs that have
even powers have that property that I
talked about in the previous answer
video either end of the graph is going
to point in the same direction or either
going to have a sort of U shape overall
or sort of upside-down U shape the you
for X to the fourth just happens to be a
bit steeper than it does for x squared
so let's see if this pattern continues
as we move even higher in degree with
our polynomial functions yet again I've
added more graphs one of these is the
graph of y equals x to the fifth and one
of them is the graph of y equals x to
the sixth so thinking about the patterns
that you noticed over here with our
first three graphs that we are
considering what do you think the
overall behavior of this fifth degree
function would look like versus the
sixth degree function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
