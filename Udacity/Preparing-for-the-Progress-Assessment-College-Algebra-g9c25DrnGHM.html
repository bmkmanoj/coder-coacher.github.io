up let's talk about how to review the
topics we've covered this far our
journey with Grant began way back with
talking about variables and expressions
which we then combined into equations to
help him start figuring out a plan for
his glasses wiper business first we
dealt with linear equations and
inequalities how to graph them and how
to solve them once we encountered
situations where grant needed parabolas
and their corresponding quadratic
equations we figured out how to handle
those as well along the way we've worked
with every category of real number that
we talked about at the very start of the
course as well as a new classification
of number complex numbers which have
both real and imaginary components
you've learned a ton about algebra in
the course so far and you may be
wondering how do I study for all of this
material and how do I take a test on the
audacity site well we've come up with a
few tips to help you out go back and
look at practice questions and problem
sets for lessons 1 through 16 I also
recommend watching my review sessions
and redoing the problems that come after
them make sure that you're comfortable
using math quill since you'll have to
input some answers on the test using it
if you look at the math quill overview
page on the wiki and you can go back to
quizzes in the units that use math quill
and practice typing things in there also
make sure you're comfortable working
things out on paper as well as typing
them best of luck we know you're going
to do great after this first midterm
will be moving on to a second case study
a new context for learning about algebra
we're sad that our time with Grant is
over but he's going to be just fine
handling his classes fight for business
not we've taught him so much about math
and now we get to study something new
and exciting architecture this is going
to help us learn about function
specifically higher order polynomial
functions and rational functions and
give us a lot of pretty things to look
at and understand mathematically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
