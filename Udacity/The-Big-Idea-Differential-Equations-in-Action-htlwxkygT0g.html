behind anti-lock braking systems looking
at this curve it's obviously best to
have a moderate amount of weird slip say
Oh point2 so the wheels must not be
rolling perfectly it's also not good if
the fields do not roll at all if they
are locked a wheel slip up about Oh
point2 would make most sense this is the
objective we have to have some type of
technology that makes sure the wheel
slip stays around Oh point2 so that we
apply the maximum amount of friction
this ensures that the braking distance
is as short as possible but it also
ensures the maximum amount of steer
ability the larger the friction is the
better we can steer the car while it is
breaking you may ask yourself ok all
this is good and well but why don't we
simply build a break that applies this
amount of friction and then we're done
with it no electronics no sensors no
actuators whatsoever the problem is that
this curve looks different on the
different circumstances with a higher
speed it may look like that when there's
water on the road it may look like that
and so on so we do not know in advance
which amount of friction would be best
what we do know that the slippage of 0
point to almost always makes sense
footnote / you slip of open to actually
does not make sense on snow and on sand
if you're on snow and on sand locking
the wheels as quickly as possible is the
best option</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
