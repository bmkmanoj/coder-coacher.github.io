different ways to monetize your app from
premium to freemium options but
sometimes it can be difficult to decide
on a strategy wouldn't it be nice to get
paid just based on how much people like
your game yep and amazon has actually
created a monetization model that tries
to do justice it's called amazon
underground cool tell me more about it
how can I gain make money off of
likeability well it's hard to measure
likeability but we can get an idea of
that based on how often a game is played
so amazon underground pays game
developers based on how much time
players spend in their game that sounds
pretty interesting so every player would
help to monetize your game exactly
amazon underground has a great selection
of premium apps and games of free and
all in-app purchases are free too for
example you mentioned playing fruit
ninja before and in the underground
version you can get all the stars and
golden apples you want for free they're
still packaged in a store like in the
original game format but their price is
zero so no other monetization models are
used that sounds really easy but how
much money can a developer expect to
make off of this model well underground
has a per-minute payment rate which
translates to 12 cents and our this can
add up especially if you have a lot of
players what an interesting way to
monetize this is something to keep in
mind when you're designing your game
different platforms may have built and
monetization strategies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
