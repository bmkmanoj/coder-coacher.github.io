problems and with algorithms so we
should say a little bit more about each
one of the two so a problem normally
consists of three parts the first one is
very simple it's just a name that we
give to the problem so that when we talk
about it we know how to reference it and
in this case we're going to find a
better name for that soon but in this
case we'll just call the problem that
Alice was working on Alice's problem for
each problem we also need to say
something about the input that we're
expecting for it so in this case here
it's a network of communication centers
and of course we also need to say
something about the output that we are
expecting so in this case here it would
be the minimum number of monitoring
devices to cover all cables or
connections of course the most useful
output would be to know not only the
minimum number of monitoring devices but
where we should actually put them but
you're soon going to see that it doesn't
really make much of a difference most of
the time if we are just asking for the
minimum number or if we're actually
asking for the communication centers
where we need to put those devices now
what Alice devised to solve this problem
was a possible algorithm now there's no
really accepted definition of what an
algorithm actually is but for us it's
enough to say that whenever we talk
about an algorithm we'll be talking
about the description of a computer
program that is able to solve the
problem that we're given now the
question that we want to answer for
Alice's problem since the algorithm that
she has found is not very good is if the
problem that she's working on is a hard
problem or an easy problem and what we
mean by that is if it's possible to find
a more efficient algorithm for this
problem if that is the case then we
would call this problem an easy problem
or we will soon have a more precise
definition of that actually and if it's
not possible to find a better algorithm
for the problem then this would be
considered a hard problem now the
hardness of a problem tells you how fast
and with how many resources you can
solve the problem but of course that
would require you to find the best
possible
for that problem and best is not a very
scientific term so we'll have to say a
little bit more about the analysis of
algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
