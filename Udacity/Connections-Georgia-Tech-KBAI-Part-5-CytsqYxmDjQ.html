we've actually been talking about kinds
of metacognition throughout this course
even if we didn't call it that at the
time we were talking about agents
reflecting on their own knowledge and
correcting it when they're introduced to
a mistake earlier in this lesson we also
talked about the possibility that an
agent would reflect on the learning
process that'll let it to the incorrect
knowledge and correct that learning
process as well back during partial
order planning we talked about agents
that could balance multiple plans and
resolve conflicts between those plans
this could be seen as a form of
metacognition as well the agent plans
out a plan for achieving one goal I'll
plan for achieving the other goal and
then thinks about its own plans for
those two goals then it detects the
conflict between those plans and
resolves that conflict accordingly then
it detects a conflict between those two
plans and creates a new plan to avoid
that conflict here the agent is
reasoning over its own planning process
we saw this in production systems as
well we had an agent that reached an
impasse it had two different pitches
suggested and it couldn't decide between
the two that spawned a new learning goal
to find a rule to choose between those
pitches it didn't select today or
learning strategy of chunking went to
its memory found a case and chunked a
rule that would help it resolve that
impasse in this case the agent used that
impasse to set up a new learning goal it
then selected a strategy strategy
selection to achieve that learning goal
we can also see metacognition inversion
spaces our agent has a notion of
specific and general models and it also
has a notion of convergence the agent is
consistently thinking about its own
specific and general model and looking
for opportunities to converge them down
into one model of the concept and
finally we can very clearly see
metacognition in our lesson on diagnosis
we talked about how the results of our
treatment become new data for our
iterative process of diagnosis if our
treatment didn't spawn desirable results
it also spawns data for the metal layer
not only do we still want to diagnose
the current malfunction but we also want
to diagnose why we weren't able to
diagnose it correctly in the first place
so now we're diagnosing the problem with
our diagnosis process so as we can see
metacognition has actually been implicit
in several of the topics we've talked
about in this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
