hashable object suggests that set is
mutable we haven't yet found a way to
mutate sets we could find it by looking
at the documentation but we're
programmers we usually prefer to do
experiments than to play around with
reading documentation so let's think
about the other kinds of experiments we
should do and i'm going to show you one
useful thing that you can do in the Terp
retur and i'm going to show you one
interesting thing you can do in the
interpreter to help with those
experiments so I've created a set here
and now I'm going to use the durer
operation we can apply der to any object
and what we get as a result of der is a
list of all the names in that objects
namespace so we can think of these as
all the things that you can do with s
each of these names after s followed by
dot is something we could do with us and
you see in idle the Python interpreter
I'm doing now it actually gives us a
list of those as choices when we type s
done so we could try any of these
operations and see what they do let's
start with ad and we can see ad was
listed here in the directory and another
thing we can see and you won't see this
if you use the in browser ID when we
start to type ad we actually see
documentation for what it does pop up
this is the way things work in idle the
default Python interpreter if you
download that from python org different
environments for running Python will do
different things but this is really
handy that it says well add does what we
might expect it adds an element to the
set let's add the element for we note
that ad did not return something there's
no result here we can confirm that using
print let's add five to the set as well
the result that comes back is none so
there's no result from ad but what it
did was add the object to the set so we
can see the value of the set now
includes four and five let's look a
little more at the different operations
that we have on the set they're all
these double underscore ones at the
start
these are called special method names
often known as magic methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
