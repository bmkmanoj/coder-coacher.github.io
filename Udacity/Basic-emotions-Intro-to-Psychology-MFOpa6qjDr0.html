emotions that are shared by all humans
in all cultures no matter where you are
in the world then we have other emotions
that are more unique to the human
condition these are called
self-conscious emotions basic emotions
are important for life tasks such as
protecting ourselves from danger or
achieving a goal the basic emotions are
fear disgust anger happiness sadness
contempt and surprise notice that all of
these except happiness and arguably
sometimes surprise our negative emotions
that is they involve unpleasant
subjective feelings
there are many distinct negative
emotions for example anger is very
different from disgust which is very
different from fear or sadness they all
involve different feelings and come from
different things on the other hand
happiness is happiness it is only just a
little bit different than joy the other
set of emotions the self-conscious
emotions occur when we live up to or
don't live up to the expectations we set
ourselves the expectations of others or
the rules set by society these emotions
require us to be able to reflect on our
own behaviors the self-conscious
emotions are shame guilt humiliation
embarrassment and pride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
