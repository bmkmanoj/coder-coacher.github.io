I've said nothing about function
approximation over States I'm talking
about abstraction over this set of
actions that you have well you did talk
a little bit about States when you said
that all the states and say the the
northeast room end up being sort of
equivalent right equivalent with respect
to the action that you want to take yes
yeah right which is its own kind of
approximation its own kind of abstract
all of these are different kinds of
abstraction really okay and will allow
us to do scale so let me just add one
more thing to this before we move on to
the next slide and what I want to point
out is that this isn't just a way for
you to think about this problem or to
sort of in a compact and efficient way
explain how you would accomplish a
particular goal it actually has other
computational benefits so if we think in
this sort of southeast room here about
how value propagation works right you
took a bunch of actions in here you got
to this good space then you start
backing up values right so I know this
is worth you know a lot because one is
the biggest number in the universe
without loss of generality assume one is
the largest number and then I'm gonna
learn that being in this state and
taking this particular action is also
good I'll just draw a little dot here
the big size saying that's really good
and a slightly smaller dot and a
slightly smaller dog and so the value of
the states around here are nice and big
because I can easily get from here to
the goal state and as I move farther
away the value gets to be you know a
little bit less and then a little bit
less and a little bit less and it sort
of propagates out into the other rooms
and the way that you propagate this
information is actually kind of slow
right you have to get to the state and
sort of back it up a little bit your
horizon is such that the value seems
relatively small and you kind of keep
going and you have to visit this often
very often actually to back up the
information to tell you sort of what the
value of the states are what the Q
values of state and action pairs are and
that's fine that's how we do our that's
how we learn in MDPs but because I have
this abstract action I have this go-to
doorway I can actually from here
from this particular state at the
doorway back up information all the way
to here wherever it is I executed that
particular action in sort of one step so
I learn a lot about the value of being
in this state immediately from having
taken that and gotten here so as soon as
information from my little +1 box here
gets me to here
I can back that information all the way
up to where I initially executed to go
to the door ax and similarly now that
I've got information here I can back it
all the way up to the value of being in
this state and so I can back up
information and value much more quickly
without having to back it up sort of one
little state at a time so there's a lot
of advantages here sort of computational
and otherwise that will hopefully allow
us to learn faster cool and I think
that's helping me understand why it's
temporal abstraction right so state
abstraction is treating a whole bunch of
states sort of equivalently this is
actually treating a whole bunch of time
steps equivalently right that we write
just kind of allied over them right and
now you'll notice that it will have this
side effect of allowing us to treat a
bunch of states similarly because we
know that for one way of thinking about
similarity between states is how their
features are similar to one another
that's what that's what you talked about
another way to think about similarity
among states is to think about whether
you should take the same action when
you're in them and so every single state
in this room is the same in the sense
that the optimal action is the same go
