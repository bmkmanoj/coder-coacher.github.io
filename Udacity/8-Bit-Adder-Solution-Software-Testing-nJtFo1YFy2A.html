to this programming quiz we're trying to
get one hundred percent branch coverage
for an eight bit adder and so the way I
solve this is using exhaustive testing
the inside is is that 8-bit inputs
characterize the full range of values
from 0 to 255 and so what I can do is
write a function test exhaustive which
lets I loop over the range 0 to 255 J
loop over the range 0 to 255 and then
define am I add function which is going
to invoke the eight bit adder with those
inputs then what we're going to do is
print the output and assert that the
result is equal to the actual I plus J
output and this goes a little bit beyond
what I asked you to do for the quiz but
it's a good idea to make sure that the
code is right so now this might add
function is kind of where the magic
happens and so what my ad does is takes
an integer a and splits that into the
bits splits it into eight bits that
represent the same value as the integer
do the same thing for B then we're going
to call the add eight bits function with
the bits of a in the bits of be
resulting in a set of bits representing
the somme then we can glue those back
into an integer and that's going to be
returned to check in our assertion so
let's look at the split and glue
functions so split is pretty simple it
just takes an integer and if n bitwise
and with one is true then the low order
bit must have been set and so will
return a true value for the lower bit
position then we'll go to comparing with
2 4 8 16 32 64 and 128 together these
tests serve to split the input integer
into a sequence of true and false values
that together represent that integer now
the glue function does exactly the
opposite thing it takes a series of
boolean values and glues them into an
integer and the way do we do this is by
keeping a running total so if B 0 that
is to say if the low-order bit of the
input is set we increment our running
total by Juan if the next bit is set we
increment it by 2 if the third bit is
set we increment it by 4 then 8 16 32 64
128 and 256 and so together just lets us
reconstruct an integer value from its
set of bids and so when we call these
things together we can verify that the
code actually implements an adder and
incidentally because we're testing it on
all possible values we're going to get
full branch coverage and so let's just
make sure that that's the case ok so we
just ran the code now let's look at the
coverage up so here
looking at the coverage output and we
can see is that of the 85 statements
present in the adder all 85 of them ran
so none of them are missing and there
were zero partially executed comparison
statements that is to say zero
comparison statements which only went
one way so if we look through the code
we can see that indeed the coverage tool
believes that it's all covered so now
let's look at an alternative solution so
instead of four exhaustive tests we
could have written a much smaller test
that get one hundred percent branch
coverage and this is based on the
observation that if we look at the
cascading series of tests in the branch
coverage basically all that matters are
whether the input bits are 0 r 1 and so
if we call the adder with all 0 bits we
call it with all 1 bits and then we need
one more test case we can get one
hundred percent branch coverage this way
so let's just make sure that that's
indeed the case I'm going to run at ER
again this time it's not printing out
anything and let's go back to the web
page this time we have 81 statements and
they all ran and we have 0 missing
statements and 0 partially executed
statements and so as you can see the
coverage tool believes that just these
three really simple test cases were
sufficient to get one hundred percent
branch coverage of our adder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
