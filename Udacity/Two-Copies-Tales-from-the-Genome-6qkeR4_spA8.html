the girl the heart condition for example
neither one of her parents have the same
condition so how can they be responsible
if they don't share the same trait well
one of the big discoveries that I picked
up on is that living organisms have two
copies of every gene and though these
copies can be different from each other
only one manifests itself as a trait in
a certain generation let's use our deck
of playing cards as an example let's
imagine that each parent has to playing
cards each a six of hearts which
correlates with a normal functioning
heart and an ace which can cause the
abnormal heart condition even though one
of the copies and the pair causes the
heart condition it's hidden as long as
the other copy has normal function so
the parent appears to have normal heart
function even though they have one
normal copy and one abnormal copy when
the parents have a child each parent
randomly passes on one of the cards as
long as the child ends up with at least
one number card she'll have normal heart
function but if she ends up with two
aces she'll suffer from that abnormal
heart condition so see if you can figure
out how many total possible combinations
there are if these two parents have a
child and how many combinations would
result in the heart condition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
