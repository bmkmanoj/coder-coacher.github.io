request we need to specify some
additional details that are essential
before establishing the network
connection so far the HTTP URL
connection object only contains the
destination we want for this request we
still need to define the action that the
server should perform on the request
this is expressed using one of the HTTP
verbs we described earlier such as GATT
or post the next step is to make sure
you set the desired HTTP method which
allows you to be explicit about what
exactly you want to do with HTTP
connection there are a few common HTTP
method types or actions that you should
be aware of when we're getting
information to be returned to us the
best method to use is get there's
several other methods to use an HTTP
well get is the most commonly used
option post is also frequently used when
you need to update some information on a
server such as when your update a blog
post or you're entering billing
information or shopping online in other
words a get request is typically reading
information from the server and sending
it back to the client while a post
request is generally contains
information to be written to the server
check out the lesson notes for links on
where you can learn more about the
various other HTTP methods for example
when you enter a URL into a web browser
a get request containing the destination
URL is generated and sent to the server
this request also contains a header
section which includes metadata about
the request its includes things like
what types of languages and encodings
the client can accept and information
about the client such the operating
system and the screen dimensions mobile
apps do the exact same thing when
they're requesting information from a
server so how do you know what request
method to set well you can check the
documentation for the given API they're
using to confirm it each API endpoint
should be explicitly documented with the
HTTP action required it should be
consistent with the get and post
behavior we explained earlier in cases
where no action is
if I'd get is typically assumed for
example let's go back to the Twitter
public API there are many endpoints
provided to fetch information about
users tweets friends or account
information Twitter specifies upfront
whether any of these endpoints are get
or post requests let's click on this API
endpoint which lets us get the most
recent tweets posted by a user if I
scroll down a bit I can find the
resource URL where we can make the HTTP
request and get is the HTTP request
method type because we're reading the
existing tweets from the Twitter server
there are many other examples where we
may get requests to get the list of
direct messages or lists of friends from
a user on the other hand if we want to
write new data to the Twitter server we
need to use a post request the API
endpoint allows us to point to a new
tweet we have to make a connection to a
new URL and specify the post method type
remember that if you make a post request
you need to send the new data along as
well in this case the message text for a
new tweet post is used when you're
writing to the server which means you're
creating the leading or updating an
entity this will make the new
information available to other clients
when they perform a get request for the
latest tweets here's another quick
example the Instagram API these
endpoints allow you to get information
about a user or the images or video
files that they recently posted or liked
all of these requests are reading
information from the server so they are
all get requests on the other hand the
Instagram comments API allows you to get
or modify the comments on post here you
can see the request method type is get
post or delete sometimes you'll see
delete as its own action whereas post
will be for creating a comment delete is
for deleting a comment sometimes all
this behavior is combined in the general
post request that handles any type of
modification on the server data it just
depends on how the API was built for a
list of all the API requests
methods see the link below but for the
purposes of this course we just want you
to become comfortable with the
distinction between get versus post or
reading from versus writing to the web
server</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
