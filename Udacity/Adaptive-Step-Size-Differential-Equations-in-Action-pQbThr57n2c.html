in the middle of the unit so your task
for this quiz is going to be to
implement adaptive step sizes we've
already provided hawaiians method for
you so you just have to determine the
next value of the step size H there's
one important change to the framework
however you see we're dealing with
single vectors here we're no longer
filling arrays of vectors so the reason
that we just are using single vectors is
because we don't know upfront how many
steps the simulation is going to have
the number of steps is going to depend
on the values of age that are being
computed so we're not storing a history
of X and V any more because we don't
know how many entries that history would
have to contain so when we plot the
result we're not going to be plotting a
Col curve we're going to be plotting
just a single dot at each different
location now you can see that in
addition to the step size H right here
we've also created a variable for you
called H nu inside this while loop we
want H to store the current step size
and then we'll compute the next step
size as H nu at the end of each step we
want to add H to the time that has
passed which is what's happening right
here and then we want to set H equal to
H nu which signals that we moved on to
the next step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
