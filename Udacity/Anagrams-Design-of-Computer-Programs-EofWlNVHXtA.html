anagram is a rearrangement of letters in
a word or phrase to form new words or
phrases so for example an anagram of the
phrase anagrams could be we start
pulling out letters and we could say and
and then maybe arm and then we're left
with geas or let's we could write that
essay G so this phrase is an anagram of
that one because it uses all and no more
of the letters it's ok to have extra
spaces in between the words here there
could have been extra spaces between the
words here could have been a multi-word
phrase spaces don't matter just that you
use up all the letters and so your task
going to be to write the function
anagrams which takes as input a phrase
which is a string like the string
anagrams or it could be a string with
multiple words separated by spaces and
then an optional argument saying what's
the shortest word you're going to accept
in the answer so here we allow two
letter words and up if we wanted we
could say will only allow three letter
words and up and we're so long and this
is going to return a set of phrases
which maybe multi-word phrases like that
now will be generating all possibilities
from the words in the dictionary so
these words are all in the dictionary
but notice that for these three words
they could appear in any of six possible
orders 3 factorial possible orders and
it'd be kind of boring and repetitious
to see all of those so we're only going
to show out of each of those six
possibilities or n possibility or n
factorial possibilities for an N word
phrase only show the one that's in
alphabetical order so here the word and
is alphabetically before the word arm
which is alphabetically before the word
sack so that's the representative we've
shown out of the six possibilities so I
want you to generate that set and you
can use things that we've had before
like the set of words and prefixes that
we've already defined and you might find
it useful
well to reuse functions such as fine
words here's the skeleton of the
function with its signature is going to
return a set of words and hear some
examples of calling anagrams checking to
see some of the results are remember of
those set and here we've listed the
complete set against our small
dictionary of words for anagrams of the
words pythonic I notice here that we
have hypno tick but not hypnotic because
if not a cap and not to be in our
dictionary even though hypnotic is an
anagram of pythonic go ahead and write
your code here and feel free to copy and
paste whatever previous code you need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
