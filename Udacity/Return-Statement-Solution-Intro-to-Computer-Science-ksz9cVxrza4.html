things we want the outputs to be the
value of URL and the value of end quote
so we know both the string that was
found that's the target of the link as
well as the value of end quote and we
can do that by just returning those two
values we're gonna have returning URL
followed by a comma followed by end
quote and so that means that the two
outputs from our procedure are the two
values of URL and the value of end quote
so congratulations you've defined your
first procedure
this deserves a big smiley face
procedures are really important ideas in
computer science we're gonna find lots
more procedures both today and through
the rest of the course and almost
everything we do in terms of building
programs is about building procedures
those are the main things that we use to
break down problems into things that we
can solve we're gonna have some more
quizzes about procedures soon but first
I want to give you an idea of how rich
inputs and outputs can be when we do
computation and we'll do that by looking
at what happens when you build a
self-driving car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
