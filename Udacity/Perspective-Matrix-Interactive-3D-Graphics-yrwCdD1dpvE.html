from the 3js parameters the numbers in
the upper left 3x3 are scale factors
similar to how the orthographic
projection works though the Z scale is a
little different there's also a
translation factor for Z however the big
differences here are that there's a
negative 1 in the last row and the lower
right corner now has a 0 I'm not going
to derive this projection formula here
most good 3d graphics texts run through
this process also be aware that for some
formulations the near and far values are
negative since you're traveling down the
negative z axis the one headache of
keeping things in a right handed system
is this whole plus z axis points at the
viewer problem I'm using positive near
and far values in this matrix because
that's how 3gs specifies things and
thank heavens for that in fact these two
values must be positive numbers for the
perspective transform you can see things
would get weird if the near value for
example was somewhere behind the camera
for orthographic projection we can use
whatever numbers we like for near and
far even negative values since we're
really selecting just a box in space for
perspective we're doing something more
elaborate with transforming space so
these values must be positive the
interesting thing is how this
perspective matrix works with
coordinates let's take a nice simple
case field of view 90 degrees aspect
ratio 1 near 1 and far 11 this gives us
this matrix let's use this matrix on
some test points and see what we get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
