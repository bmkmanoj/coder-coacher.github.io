dwarfism describes an individual of
particularly short stature as a result
of slow or deficient bone growth now the
most common type of dwarfism occurs in
roughly one out of every ten thousand
people let's take a look at a fictional
family with an african-american
background this is Bobby and here's a
pedigree of Bobby's family with regards
to the trait of dwarfism here you see
the Bobby is unaffected by dwarfism and
neither his mom or his dad or his sister
are affected by dwarfism either however
he has a paternal grandmother a paternal
uncle and two first cousins male and
female that are affected by the trade of
dwarfism before we explore the genetic
reason behind this trait I want you to
first tell me the inheritance pattern
that you see for dwarfism in this
pedigree based on the pedigree you see
here and what you've already learned
about inheritance patterns and dominance
I want you to tell me first what you
think the most likely inheritance
pattern is for dwarfism is it autosomal
sex-linked or maternal and tell me the
dominance does it look dominant or
recessive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
