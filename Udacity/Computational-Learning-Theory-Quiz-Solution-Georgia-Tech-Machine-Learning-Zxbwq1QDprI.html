let's see what you've come up with okay
so I would choose for the second one
support vector machines and the reason
why is because there seems to be a
single line that seems to be in the
middle between where the plus and the
minus R so it looks like it's trying to
maximize the margin yeah though those
aren't training points I'm just labeling
the region's oh never mind
well then I totally misunderstood to do
I stand by it
yeah I think I think that's a perfectly
fine answer because this a basic support
vector machine is going to find a linear
separator and so the output the
classifier that comes out of it is going
to separate any kind of region into
pluses and minuses with some line
separating them out that's also true of
perceptrons it's also true of certain
kinds of you know simple neural nets so
all of those seem like they'd be
reasonable answers for the middle one
okay well then given that I'm gonna say
the third one is a nearest neighbors
method ah good and like what nearest
neighbor do you think k nearest neighbor
I was thinking one nearest neighbor yeah
I was to actually believe it or not one
nearest neighbor so we I don't think we
got a chance to draw one of these
diagrams when we were talking about
nearest neighbors but this is called a
room for an O a diagram right because
what what happening is it's breaking up
the plane into the regions that are
closest to some particular points and
give it a set of points it breaks up the
plane to things closest to that and in
this particular case our we had we
probably had three points and one was
labeled plus and another one was labeled
plus one was labeled - and so it broke
the space up into these sections that
way so this should provide diagrams can
be very aesthetically pleasing I don't
think I drew this one particularly well
I think it's perfect my eyes are close I
think it's perfect
given that that I'm gonna say the first
one is decision trees very good because
decision trees split things you know if
you're talking about in this in a two
dimensional space it's going to split at
the top node in one dimension and here
it looks like that's this split then
maybe looks like on the left side that's
a minus on the right side there's
another split on the left side of that
it's a plus on the right side there's
another split and two pluses and minuses
you can
these sort of interesting nested
rectangles they also can be very pretty
right big Mondrian --is-- yeah very good
so this is not what we're going to talk
about today okay good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
