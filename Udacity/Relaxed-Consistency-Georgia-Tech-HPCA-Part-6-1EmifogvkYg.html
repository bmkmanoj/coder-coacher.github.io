create better solutions for sequential
consistency which programmers naturally
might expect is to actually relax the
consistency that is we tell the
programmers that they cannot really
expect sequential consistency but we can
still tell them that they can expect
something and these relaxed consistency
models that are not really sequential
consistency but they're not just like
anything goes
usually differ in terms of what types of
ordering do they enforce there are
really four types of ordering there is
ordering between rights to different
locations
there are orderings between rights to
some locations and reads of other
locations there is ordering between
reads and subsequent writes in program
order between reads and other reads in
program order sequential consistency
says that basically program execution
must obey all four types of ordering at
all times if we actually reorder
something we have to fix any situation
where that would result in a different
outcome than program order execution so
we are allowed to reorder things but we
have to always hide that from anybody
being able to see it in relaxed
consistency models some of these types
of ordering need not be obeyed at all
times usually the first type of ordering
that will not be obeyed is the read read
so if we maintain the ordering between
writes and between writes and reads but
just allow reads to proceed out of order
then we say that we have a less relaxed
model then if we allow reordering of
other types so if we told the
programmers that you have to write
programs without assuming that reads are
done in correct order then the real
question is but how do we then write
correct programs to begin with so for
example how do we do flag
synchronization if we cannot expect that
after waiting on a flag we will be able
to read the new value of the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
