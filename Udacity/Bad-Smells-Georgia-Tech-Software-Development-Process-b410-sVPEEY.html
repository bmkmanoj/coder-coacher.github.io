smells well we mentioned earlier that
refactoring is typically applied when
there is something that does not look
right does not feel right in the code
and that's exactly what belt smells are
bad smells or code smells if you wish
are symptoms in the code of a program
that might indicate deeper problems so
there might be parts of my system
classes in my systems they just don't
smell right and it feels like there's
much there might be something wrong with
them and if you're an experienced
developer just like Brad you will be
able to figure out there is something
wrong with these classes you will be
able to smell and there's something
wrong and you'll do something about it
and I want to mention one more just to
make sure that we're on the same page
here that these bad smells are usually
not bugs and don't prevent the problem
from functioning they however indicate
weaknesses in the design of the system
that might cause problems during
maintenance in other words they might
make the code less maintainable harder
to understand and so on just like
refactorings there's also many possible
different bad smells so what I'm
providing here is just a possible list
of some very common bad smells and you
can find plenty of information on this
online so what I want to do next is just
the cover before finishing the lesson a
few of those to show you some examples
of smells and what you can do about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
