instructor for CS 212 design of computer
programs now I'm assuming that you have
some background you took CS 101 or the
equivalent elsewhere so you understand
the basics of statements expressions and
data types in Python or some other
language
now what this class will be about is the
design process how to take what you
already know and put them together in
order to solve a problem we'll talk
about some of the attributes of good
programs correctness efficiency
generality and so on and we'll give you
a process for thinking about design how
to go from the uncertain stage of not
knowing what the problem really is and
working your way all the way through to
a good solution we'll also give you a
set of tools that you can use along the
way now I had a lot of fun choosing the
examples for this class and working them
out and I think you'll have a lot of fun
too and when you're done you'll have a
real sense of accomplishment so I hope
to see you in class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
