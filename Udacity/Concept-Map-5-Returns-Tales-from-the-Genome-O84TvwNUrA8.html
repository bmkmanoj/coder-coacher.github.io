biological relatives share traits and
DNA now biological relatives and traits
can be organized using a particular kind
of graphical representation called a
pedigree and we use them a lot in this
lesson there are three main types of
inheritance patterns that we learned
about there's the autosomal inheritance
pattern there's the sex-linked
inheritance pattern and there's the
maternal inheritance pattern now the
autosomal inheritance pattern is
characterized by alleles located on
autosomes the sex-linked inheritance
pattern is characterized by alleles on
sex chromosomes and the maternal
inheritance pattern is characterized by
alleles on the mitochondrial chromosome
you can learn about autosomes sex
chromosomes in the mitochondrial
chromosome to refresh yourself if you
need it back in lesson 2 now let's come
back and focus on traits and alleles
traits result from combinations of
alleles now where do these arise from
but our phenotype represents traits it's
the composite of observable traits and
our genotype is the specific composition
of alleles our genotype determines our
phenotype now for our genotype we can
have alleles that are homozygous meaning
we have two of the same allele or we can
be heterozygous two different alleles
now there are two main types of alleles
that we learned about in this lesson we
have recessive alleles that are masked
by dominant alleles and we can look at
this from the other perspective two
dominant alleles mask recessive alleles
now the DNA that is shared by biological
relatives must duplicate in every cell
before cell division and there are two
types of cell division we talked about
there's mitosis which produces all non
gametes and meiosis which produces the
gametes our sex cells now non gametes
have 46 chromosomes whereas gametes only
have 23 chromosomes half as many meiosis
increases genetic variability through
chromosome recombination and independent
assortment but overall genetic
variability can be diminished by
inbreeding but this genetic variability
that can be achieved through chromosome
in combination independent assortment
mixes and matches alleles and we first
learned about alleles in lessons three
and four but we're about to learn a lot
more about alleles and where they
originated from through mutations in
lesson 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
