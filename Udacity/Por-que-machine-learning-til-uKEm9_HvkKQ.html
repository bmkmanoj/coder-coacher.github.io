that's that that's a great question it
you know I think it touches on this this
sort of classic question or this
long-running discussion on what is the
difference between statistics and
machine learning there's there's a lot
of great papers there's one classic
paper I forget the name exactly but
something along the lines of the two
cultures talking about why these two
different approaches develops so I think
if you look at machine learning it grew
out of more of a computer science
direction and it grew out of a lot of
areas where people had very practical
hands-on questions right how can we
build the best recommendation system how
can we make the best predictions or
classifiers for a given problem and
machine learning has developed a lot of
really really good techniques for doing
that for doing things that work very
well in practice and so I think that's
there are there are a lot of
applications where that's really what
you're getting at particularly when you
have the opportunity to build a product
that will you know take some action
based on based on some algorithms those
are areas where machine learning is
really at the cutting edge of coming up
with the most effective ways of making
decisions in real time based on data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
