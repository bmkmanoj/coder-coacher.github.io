real users and there are lots of
different tips and tricks for how to do
that you can use user research and even
if you don't have like a user researcher
in house you can go to Starbucks and put
up a little sign don't tell starbucks
you're doing this though or any coffee
shop and then like bring users by show
them you know just something that you're
working on right it could be the actual
you I it could be a prototype using
something like envision where you just
hook up a bunch of screens together and
it taps it kind of feels real we even
done like storyboards it looks like a
little comic strip almost so that's one
way to do it when you're still trying to
figure out whether the idea is good or
not another type of testing that that we
do at polyvore is called fake door
testing I have a much longer talk about
it but it's essentially you don't know
if a particular feature will work or not
and you don't want to invest the time to
build it so you faked that the feature
is there so you put a button there that
has whatever it is that you were going
to build and Sam people click on it if
it doesn't work you know it says sorry
coming soon but at least you'll know how
many people would have wanted to use it
and I can give you a signal as to
whether you should build it or not let
me give you an example in the early days
of polyvore we thought maybe what we
should do is actually sell clothing
we're testing a new business model so we
we actually built out part of a feature
where you could buy multiple items from
polyvore and get a sliding discount and
then we wanted to see if people wanted
to use that or not and you can make
people enter their credit card
information and not actually ship them
stuff so we would do is once they
ordered we would go and order that stuff
ourselves on like Amazon whoever needed
to get come from and then ship it to our
office and pack it up and then ship it
back to them and so we were able to
build this in like a month test it for a
few months and then figure out very
quickly like no that is not a good
business model for us but if we try to
really build it out and build all the
relations who would have taken much much
longer than I to return for me one
civilian yeah we did lose a little bit
of money from that but it was totally
worth the fast learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
