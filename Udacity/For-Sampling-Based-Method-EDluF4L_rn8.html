going to use here and this is taken
directly from the Ross at all paper we
have a couple things first of all
there's the actual state and they use L
for location but L is not maybe not just
be the position it might also be the
scale rotation etc and then they've got
an observation that's called F and you
know why is called F because what they
were actually tracking were faces but
just think of it as the observation
we're actually talking about them as
being zzzz previously so the goal is to
predict the target location based upon
our last belief about where it was and
our current new measurements and in fact
what we need to be able to evaluate is
this probability of the location given
my last belief plus my new measurement
now we've done this before right we said
that this equation was made up of two
components and we'll just copy them back
up here the two components are the will
do the purple one first that's just our
dynamics model that says if I know where
the thing was at time t minus 1 what's
my belief about where it might be at
time T now in their work here they used
the fancy word for it is Brownian motion
for those of you remember that's little
particles just vibrating around doing
whatever they want another way of
thinking about it is they don't have a
velocity model they basically say if
something is here in the next frame it's
going to be somewhere around here and
maybe rotate it a little bit and it
doesn't remember anything about velocity
so it's just based upon position but the
new part that's kind of cool here is
this observation model this observation
model is the probability of the
observation given the the state given
the location and what they're going to
do there is they're going to use that
eigen basis approximation so what that
means is I'm going to say if I can
reconstruct this patch well from my
basis set that's going to be a high
probability and if I can't reconstruct
it well that's going to be a low
probability that's fundamentally the
observation model that they're going to
use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
