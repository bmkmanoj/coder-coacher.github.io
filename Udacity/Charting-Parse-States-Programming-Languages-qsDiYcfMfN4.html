Fibonacci we're going to apply
memoization to our attempts to parse a
grammar when we were trying to compute
Fibonacci the nth position in the chart
correspondent to the nth Fibonacci
number let's I am trying to parse a
string made out of a big list of tokens
token one token to token n all the way
up to token last we're going to try to
figure out the string one token at a
time so the nth position in the chart is
going to be all the par States we could
be in after seeing the first n tokens
the first end words in the input this
means that instead of our chart
returning a single number our chart is
going to return a set or a list an
entire collection here's a much simpler
grammar to try out this concept on e
goes to E Plus E or e goes to int we use
int like we use numb or number
represents integer right so here the
language of our grammar includes things
like in + int n plus in pleasant and
suppose in fact that the input is in
Pleasant I'm going to dry out a chart
showing n and chart of n suppose we
haven't seen any of the input yet where
could we be well conceptually my finger
is going to have to be very far to the
left I could be looking for a plus e or
I could be looking for int but
regardless i haven't seen any of it left
there's nothing in my past and the whole
world is in the future the reason I
can't be sure yet is that I've only seen
zero tokens of the input so even though
we the viewers at home the studio
audience know that eventually we're
going to be using this top rule our
chart hasn't seen enough of the input
yet to make that determination well
after seeing only one token we've seen
the int one possible state I could be in
as well I'm trying to reduce an
expression to an integer you gave me an
integer I'm done if I think the input is
going to go on a little longer I might
expect to see a plus in an e coming up
later so this is a second state that I
could be in if I've seen the int and the
plus then among other things my world
probably
looks like this I've got an Ian a-plus
in my past I'm looking for an e in my
future there might be a few other
elements in this state and we might
continue the chart a bit farther to the
right but this is the basic idea it's
just like our chart for Fibonacci but
instead of holding a single number it
holds a list or a sequence of parsing
states and each parsing state is a rule
in our grammar augmented with a single
red dot somewhere on the right hand side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
