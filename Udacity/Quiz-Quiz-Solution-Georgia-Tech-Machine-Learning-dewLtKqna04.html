so let's actually go through that
exercise and just derive how we do that
because it's not so bad in two
dimensions and it generalizes to higher
dimensions as well okay so it turns out
that we can use calculus to do this I am
NOT going to step through the two
variable example for reasons that I am
embarrassed to say but I am going to
show you a different example so imagine
that what we're trying to do is that
we've got a bunch of data points and
we're trying to find the best constant
function right so the best function that
has the form the value of the function
for any given X is always the same
constant C all right so if our data
looks like this we've got a bunch of X's
and a bunch of wise then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna say for any
given value of C any given constant we
can have an error what's the error going
to be the error is going to be the sum
over all the data points of the squared
difference between that constant we
chose and what the actual Y I value is
so that's running these differences here
yes Charles can I ask you a question
sure why are we doing sum of squared
errors ah there's many different error
functions and sometimes call a related
concept called a loss function there's
lots of different ones that could work
you could do the absolute error you
could do the squared error you can do
various kinds of squashed errors where
you know the errors count different
depending on how much deviation there is
it turns out that this one is
particularly well behaved because of
this reason that I'm explaining now that
that because this error function is
smooth as a function of the constant C
we can use calculus to actually find the
minimum error value but there's lots of
other things that could work and they'd
actually do find utility in various
different machine learning settings okay
so just now using the chain rule if we
want to find how does this error
function output change as a function of
the input C we can take the derivative
of this sum you know bring the two over
times this times the derivative of the
inside which is negative 1 in this case
and now this gives us a nice smooth
function saying what the the change in
the error is as a function of C and if
want to find the minimum what do we have
to do to this quantity you set it equal
to zero because that's what I remember
from calculus that's right so in
particular if the error you know the
error function is this nice smooth thing
the derivative is is negative and then
zero and then positive when it hits zero
that's when the thing has bottomed out
all right so now we just need to solve
this this equation for C so we have one
equation in one unknown alright so that
gets us this but this quantity it's just
the constant added to itself n times so
it's n times C we move that to the other
side we get n times C n is the number of
data points as your call is the sum of
the Y's we divide through by n and what
do we see so what is it Charles the best
constant is the average of all your wife
rate it's the mean the mean comes back
right so in the case of finding the best
constant here we just have to average
the Y the Y's together and that gives us
the thing that minimizes the squared
error so squared error is this really
nice thing because it tends to bring
things like mean back into the picture
it's really very convenient and it
generalizes to higher higher order
functions here not higher order
functions but more variables like like
lines sorry lines that have some non
constant slope by doing the same kind of
process and things actually work out
really nicely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
