infer the underlying clinical processes
that patients receive as they traverse
the complex service areas of a hospital
more importantly can we identify
differences in these processes and the
impact these have on outcomes and costs
this analysis is common in other
industries and is referred to as process
mining however these industries
typically have mechanized processes
where automated sensors routinely
inaccurately provide digital timestamp
data this is not yet the case in
healthcare which is still a largely
manual industry and one where care steps
may be documented digitally but either
incompletely inaccurately or after the
fact nevertheless there are situations
where process mining appears to be
feasible this is research from the
Netherlands where process mining
originated in the late 1990s it examined
the care of ischemic stroke patients
patients with a clot in the arteries of
their brain in two hospitals shown here
the results clearly indicate significant
differences with one hospital or the
left here emphasizing the use of
treatments aimed at protecting brain
cells to limit the damage from the
ischemia this is the more
state-of-the-art approach this is early
work but here at Georgia Tech we feel
that process mining is a potentially
important technology for re-engineering
a healthcare delivery system to make it
safer more cost-effective and ultimately
a more valuable and responsible
component of our society which of these
are limitations of the Dutch ischemic
stroke study check all that apply</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
