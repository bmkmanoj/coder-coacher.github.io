the design sprayer process design is
fundamentally about solving problems and
a design sprint formalizes that process
and it makes it so that anyone
regardless of their background
regardless of whether they've done
design before can come into the room
follow a step-by-step problem-solving
process and come up with a great
solution to a tough challenge yeah it
just sounded like exactly what I was
looking for a step-by-step logical
almost like cold repeatable approach to
designing products it's now used by
every big company in the world that
works on great products everyone from
Facebook slack Blue Bottle coffee
Spotify I'm really excited about this
course because I think it's the most
comprehensive program you can do because
it's not just here the exercises it's
also here are the behind the scenes and
kind of watkins exercises really mean
after years of running them in every
possible type of company Jonathan and
his entire team at AJ and smart are
fantastic instructors and I really think
that you'll love the way that they teach
this process join us today and
experience how the design spam process
will change the way that you solve
problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
