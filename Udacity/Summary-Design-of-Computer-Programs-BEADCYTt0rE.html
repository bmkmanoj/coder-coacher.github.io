group function so what group does is it
takes a list of items and then returns a
list of counts of items and the odd item
itself so it just goes through the set
of items and returns pairs of the count
and the set and then sorts them in
reversed order so that the highest comes
first and now this returns a list of
pairs and we would like to turn that
into a pair of list and the unzip
function does that and it's a little bit
tricky you have to look up the zip
function and apply it to the D
structured list of the pairs but rest
assured that that just pulls out
converts a pair a list of pairs into a
pair of lists and then we call that up
here in order to get the right answer
now I'm always thinking about
refactoring also I was thinking of when
are you done and when there's a time not
to refactor anymore but I was having so
much fun with this I just wanted to try
one more possibility and that's to say
rather than have a long case statement
of the different results can we just
have them in a lookup table and so what
I did is I took all seven of the
partitions of the numbers of the number
five and put them into a table called
count rankings and then had the
corresponding poker ranking 0 for a high
card one for a pair two for two pair and
so on and now instead of having a
statement here that's a long case
statement for all of the nine
possibilities I can just say that the
result is the maximum of taking the
counts looking them up in this table and
that'll give you a value for anything
having to do with pairs or three or four
of a kind and to take the maximum of
that and this expression here which says
four times straight plus 5 times flush
now that might seem a little confusing
but what that's doing is it's using
automatic conversion of boolean's into
integers and saying if straight is true
that corresponds to one and a false that
corresponds to 0 so if straight alone is
true that'll give you a four and that's
the right ranking for straight if five
alone is true
that'll give you a five and that's the
right ranking for flush and a straight
and flush is true that'll give you a
nine and what we had to do here that was
in the previous results a straight flush
was supposed to be eight but it's okay
if it's nine all you have to do is take
five of a kind and bump that up to ten
and now we get the right rankings by
taking the maximum of that we still have
to return the ranks to break the ties
but now in one line we did what took
nine lines before and you can decide is
this what you like it's nice and concise
or do you like the previous approach
because it was more explicit and that's
a question of taste it's up to you which
one you prefer now let's look at our
lessons learned so we always start by
understanding the problem look at the
specification see if it makes sense if
it doesn't make sense
talk to people try to figure it out
consider different ways of trying to
make sense of it then define the pieces
of the problem for our problem we had
cards and hands and ranks and suits and
so on figure out everything there is to
represent in the problem as much as you
can try to reuse the pieces that you
have we use the Mac funk function we use
the random shuffle function those were
sort of standard pieces that we already
knew about make sure you're right tests
you don't know what you've done you
don't know what your program does unless
you can specify it both in terms of the
pieces that you're defining and in terms
of the test that tells you what is it
that this program does and then explore
the design space we have many dimensions
for the design space we have to deal
with correctness with efficiency with
elegance and with features decide where
in the design space you want to be keep
moving in the right direction and use
good taste to know when to stop so
hopefully we've learned something from
this now let's take a look at some
homework problems to really reinforce
these lessons learned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
