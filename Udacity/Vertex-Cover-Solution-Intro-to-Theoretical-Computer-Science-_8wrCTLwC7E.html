can do a vertex cover with just three
vertices so here's one example you could
select this one which would cover all of
those edges here then we could select
this one covering all those edges and
finally we could select the one down
here so all edges are covered selecting
just three vertices and there's
alternative solutions but none that
contains less than three vertices now
what about over here here we can find a
very small vertex cover using just two
vertices this vertex here we just don't
even need to care about because it has
no edges that it's connected to we can
select this one here covers all of those
edges and we can select for example this
one here or not only for example because
this is actually the only possible
smallest solution so now we did this
exercise to see if vertex cover could
have any relation to clique or
independent set so let's have a look
back at which vertices were contained in
the largest possible clique in this
network and those were four vertices it
was this one here this one here this one
and this one not any really apparent
relation between the two problem this
one over here however is more
interesting because in the largest
possible independent set we had those
four here so it could seem like vertex
cover those two green vertices here is
exactly the opposite of independent set
so if you have found the largest
possible independent set then you have
found the smallest possible vertex cover
and indeed it's actually not that
difficult to see that this is always the
case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
