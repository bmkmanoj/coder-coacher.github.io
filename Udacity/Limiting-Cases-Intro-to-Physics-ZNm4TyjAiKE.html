physics is to create fun problems for
yourself for no other reason than just
to see if you can solve them and to see
how a system might behave here we've
created a problem for ourselves this
problem involves two masses connected by
a string over a pulley this mess is on a
plane which is inclined at some angle
alpha let's call acceleration positive
when this mass goes up and this one goes
down into the right goes the other way
acceleration would be negative now I'm
not going to ask you to solve for the
acceleration of this system maybe you
could do it maybe not but what I want
you to do is not solve yet still answer
this question and the purpose of this
question is to build your physics
intuition now the way you're going to
solve this question is by filling in
these four boxes the blue boxes you'll
fill in with either one or two to
indicate whether the appropriate mass in
that section of the equation is mass one
or mass to the purple boxes you'll fill
in with a plus sign or a minus sign now
what I want you to do is to really think
about this problem and think in your
head maybe test some limiting cases so
for example what happens if m2 is huge
and m1 is really small maybe 0 what
happens if m1 is really big and m2 is
close to 0 what do you expect the
acceleration to look like in those cases
and to your best solution in these boxes
so for example if you thought this was
the answer you'd enter a 1 a plus sign a
two and a plus sign go ahead give this
some thought and see if you can
accurately fill in those boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
