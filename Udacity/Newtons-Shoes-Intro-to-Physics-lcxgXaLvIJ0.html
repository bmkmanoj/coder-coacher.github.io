work is so important let's take a minute
to try to put ourselves in new and shoes
and imagine what his life was like so
here we are leaning against an apple
tree reading one of our favorite books
and all around us things are happening
apples are falling off trees rocks are
rolling down melons and as nature
unfolds around it we probably never
really stop to ask what's happening we
just take it for granted if we want to
think about something profound maybe we
look at the moon or the stars or the Sun
surely the motions of these perfect
celestial bodies are somehow more
perfect or different than the motions of
commonplace items like apples and rocks
now with a benefit of hindsight I'm
going to ask you a question what do the
motions of stars and apples have in
common do they have nothing in common at
all are they totally distinct and
separate or are these motions completely
identical or are they somehow different
but governed by the same set of laws
which means that the same rules which
affect how an Apple falls to the ground
also affect how the Earth orbits the Sun
or the moon orbits the earth I haven't
taught you this yet so I don't expect
you to know the answer but I do want to
get you thinking choose what you think
is the best answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
