problems have efficient algorithms
there's some that actually require an
exponential amount of running time for
example it an algorithm might have a
bound of big theta of 2 to the N so as n
gets larger this is getting larger and
larger and larger very very quickly so
this is considered not efficient we're
not going to talk in this course about
any of the problems that have provable
lower bounds that are exponential that
is to say that there can be no
polynomial time solution to them there's
one in the literature which is a
generalization of checkers that that you
can learn more about if you take a
course in complexity but what I would
like to talk about is this sort of funny
gap between the problems that we know
have efficient solutions that have
polynomial running time and the problems
that we know do not have efficient
solutions they have the the fastest
algorithms that could run for them have
to take at least exponential time but in
between here there's a gap there's
actually some very very important
problems that we don't know whether they
have a polynomial time solution or if
they require exponential time they're
just kind of hovering in this in this
no-man's land the great unknown there's
lots of different kinds of classes of
problems that live in this gap but what
I'm going to focus on for this unit is a
class of problems known as the
np-complete problems they're not the
only problems that fall in here but
they're a very important class and have
probably the best studied class of
problems that actually fall in this gap
where we just don't know if they're
polynomial or exponential running time
and it's very frustrating that we don't
know where these problems lie but we do
know something and that is for all the
np-complete problems either they're all
easy and they fit in the polynomial
running time class or they're all hard
then they fit in the exponential time
running class we don't know which it is
but we do know that they all hang
together and so sometimes it's very
useful if you're studying a problem to
discover whether it belongs to this this
funny class of np-complete problems that
fit in the gap so that's what we're
going to take a look at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
