how to install Python and then install
Google App Engine so that you can get
going on the homework that's really the
main point of this homework to get you
up and running so that for the rest of
the homeworks you actually have a good
handle on how to start and we can just
go over how to actually start building
some real-world web applications so okay
let's let's start out so here I'm at
WWDC org go ahead and go there and then
you'll get this link and go down to
download Python now and the good thing
is that if you're on Mac or Linux then
you probably already have Python
installed you shouldn't need to get
anything if you do then you can go ahead
and install it from here so down here
what you want to click on is if you're
installing Windows then either a 64-bit
system down here or 32-bit you simply
click on there and install like you
would normally on a Windows system same
thing with the Mac system on Linux you
can install a source tarball but
honestly you probably already have it
and there's an easier way to do that
with your package manager I'll have a
list of instructions for some of the
more common package managers for linux
up in the forums so we're not going to
go over that right now but go ahead and
open it for example right there and then
install it as you normally would it
shouldn't take more than a few minutes
and after that and once we have Python
installed we have everything we need for
Google App Engine so let's go ahead and
install that now Google App Engine is
right here if you don't want to type all
of this in just Google App Engine and it
should be the first option on the search
results page so before we go ahead and
sign up we're going to install the
software development environment and
it's pretty easy to use for the most
parts
we're gonna go over here to downloads
we're gonna want the Python version of
it
so either the windows the Mac or the
Linux depending on what platform you're
on don't worry about the MapReduce
bundle that's not something we need to
worry about right now so go ahead and
open up whichever one is appropriate for
your system all of them are super simple
to install once you've got it installed
we're gonna open up Google App Engine
and it opens into the screen right here
okay now what we need to do is open up a
new application so go to file new
application and then that should open up
this right here we'll go ahead and
install it under let's say hello -
Udacity create and there we go okay so
there are a couple things to look at now
we can open up the the files that this
automatically creates so go to the path
which you see right here and there's
really only one file you need to worry
about and that's main dot PI there are a
few other files in that directory we're
not going to worry about them right now
we'll explain it later there's not much
to it really here's your main file for
your web application hello Udacity so
open main dot PI and it's fairly really
a pretty short file and now you need to
change this to print out hello Udacity
we can run this you see that it's
running on port 8080 one Steve talked
about ports early in the course so we're
going to do is open up localhost 8080
one and you see hello world now you're
going to have to change this to print
out hello Udacity but the hard part the
part we're really interested in is
actually installing this so you're ready
for other homework assignments later on
when we're building some well some web
applications with some actual content
now we've got it running on our
local system but obviously well
hopefully we can't see your local system
so we need to actually sign up for
Google App Engine so let's go back to
the main page that we were at before and
sign up for an account with them it's
very simple and once you have all of
your information there then all you have
to do to put this up online is deploy it
to your account and password sign in and
it will automatically load all these
things and then once you're done you
should be able to go to the Google App
Engine website and check out your web
app now I haven't loaded this on yet but
once you do you should get the same
results from there that you do from your
localhost and that's about it
all you have to do is change this to
hello Udacity and then load up the URL
whatever this happens to be this is
hello Udacity in my in mine in yours it
would be whatever this is and put that
in for the homework assignment and you
should be good to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
