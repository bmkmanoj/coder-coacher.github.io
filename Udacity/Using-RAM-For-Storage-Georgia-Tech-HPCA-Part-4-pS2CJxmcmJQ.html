really benefit from Moore's law they
don't get much faster and also although
their capacity is improving their speed
is very very very slow so one question
will be Rams especially DRAM are
benefiting from Moore's law in terms of
capacity so their capacity is growing
about as fast as the capacity of hard
drives but they are way faster than hard
drives hard drive access times are about
let's say 10 milliseconds whereas Ram
access times are well under a
microsecond so we're talking about at
least three orders of magnitude speed
difference so the reason we normally do
not use memory for storage is that the
hard drives are about a hundred times
cheaper per gigabyte
however theorem has many times better
latency than hard drives so people came
up with this idea of solid-state disk
SSD which really is not a disk at all
it's just solid state meaning electronic
storage but because it's intended as
disk replacement they call it disk one
approach to build a solid-state disk
would be to use DRAM and a controller
that will refresh it and then have a
battery so that we can keep the dieren
content refreshed and not lose it this
is very fast it's actually very reliable
more reliable than the hard drives but
it is extremely expensive and it is not
good for archiving data because
eventually the battery will run out and
then we lose our content whereas a hard
drive can be stored for a really long
time today there is another option which
is flash memory so flash is fabricated
in similar technology to the one that is
used for making theorems and processors
and it uses transistors to store data so
it benefits from Moore's law it consumes
very little power because unlike a disk
that spends all the time even when
you're not using it flash while it's
idle consumes very very little power and
also
it doesn't need to move any heads or
anything it's still very fast way faster
than disks although it is slower than
the RAM and it has smaller capacity than
disks because for flash we're still
expressing their sizes in gigabytes
whereas disks easily go into the
terabytes and one good thing about flash
as compared to the DRAM and battery is
that flash keeps the data alive without
power so you can store something in a
flash forget about it for several years
and you will probably still be able to
read it
whereas here your battery will almost
certainly be dry after a couple of years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
