persona is different than a web or
desktop user persona so I think that a
lot of you might have started out in web
or desktop so maybe we should start
there yeah as well what are the
attributes off this web or desktop
persona well the first thing is that
they're always going to be plugged into
power yeah they generally have a
constant internet connection that's
usually fast and generally they have a
pretty big screen and they have some
sort of physical keyboard and a mouse or
a touchpad and they're seated with their
full attention usually on their laptop
or their desktop yeah this is so
different than a mobile user because
unlike mobile for web and desktop
applications let's say you're writing a
document or you're working in a
presentation chances are you're fully
immersed in the content that you're
creating on your machine and another
difference actually between web and
desktop apps and mobile apps is that
when you close a desktop app they tend
to go away like you close a tab on your
browser but mobile apps tend to run in
the background quite a bit they're
sensing your location they've all kinds
of sensors that are providing inputs and
applications are doing something with it
in the background</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
