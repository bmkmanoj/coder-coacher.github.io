actually look at my paternal line and
see sort of how far back in time and
geography we can go with this but if you
don't have a y-chromosome then how could
you ever look at your paternal lineage
and many women are interested in exactly
that same thing you know we don't have Y
chromosomes so but there is a way to
trace your paternal line even if you
don't have a Y chromosome and that is to
find someone who has your father's Y
chromosome my father passed away years
ago so he wasn't available for testing
but my uncle kindly agreed to get tested
and so I was able to learn about my
paternal line through him and other
possibilities if I had had a brother if
my paternal grandfather had been alive
so there are a number of relatives who
can help a woman trace her paternal line
okay Matt so we see here that you and
your dad have a paternal lineage called
i won actually I one star and we see
from the map that is very very frequent
in Northern Europe particularly in
Scandinavia and I don't know if you are
aware of any Scandinavian ancestry on
your dad's side but that's this is
suggesting if you go far enough back on
your dad's side you might find that you
have an ancestor who lives in
Scandinavia now this fits with the
autosomal ancestry pattern that we saw
from me right where it said I had a
strong northern year that's right yes
yes yes so this is just reinforcing that
information as it says over here that
age is 28 thousand years what does that
mean exactly so this lineage like all
the the haplogroups are defined by a
particular mutation that happened a long
time ago and in this case 28,000 years
ago a mutation happened on the Y
chromosome and it's the defining and
then everybody who inherited that
particular Y chromosome also inherited
that mutation and so the last twenty
eight thousand years men and their sons
have carried that to your mutation end
and you were part of that kind of clan
of nails with this particular lineage
but this means that in this region here
somewhere in this region is where that
mutation happened about 12 years ago we
don't know for sure where it happened
but because its most frequent in this
general region now we we speculate that
it was probably in that in that general
area near very far north in Europe now
let's take a look at actually let's go
back to Roy yes King working and his
father working senior both have a
lineage that is fairly common in in
Jewish men and that fits with Roy's
understanding that his father's father
was Jewish so we're really seeing his
grandfather right there in the DNA of
the Y chromosome so to go a little
deeper let's click on the history tab
and move away from the map and this is
an overall you know story about the
history of this lineage j2 and and it
mentions the branches of this J to have
a group spreading with a Jewish Diaspora
from the middle east across Europe so
this is just what is and this all this
information comes from studies of people
who currently carry the j2 lineage
around the world and so many scientists
have conducted studies and they've
published papers and then this story is
drawn from those publications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
