with XML let's spend a few minutes
talking syntax even if you are familiar
it might make sense to follow along with
this little review so in XML elements
are the basic building blocks of an XML
document now an XML element is composed
of an open tag and a close tag now this
is some data drawn from the New York
Times developer API encourage you to
have a look at this site we are going to
look at some data from the most popular
API these are for example articles that
are most frequently emailed among
readers of the New York Times ok so
let's take a look at a couple of
examples here so the first thing we
might notice about this particular
document is that we have some tags for
num results or some elements that have
to do with a number of results so this
is actually a result set from having
done a query to the most popular API and
we've got a here that tells us how many
results were identified by our query and
then the list of results follows now
this happens to be a single result here
and we can see that this result begins
right here with this open tag and closes
right here with this close tag okay now
just as a couple of other examples of
the data within this particular result
we can take a look at the byline note
that it's got an open and close tag as
well and some of the other elements here
if you know the title for example this
happens to be an article about bedbugs
ok so this provides an example using
some really nicely name tags we know
what these mean now there's another
aspect of XML that we need to concern
ourselves with especially given some of
the exercises that we're gonna have
later on and those have to do with
attributes for xml elements now this
document provides a number of very nice
examples of elements in xml but what we
don't have here are any examples of
attributes for any of these elements
being used so what I'd like to do here
is talk about essentially the two types
of data that we're going to look at that
have been encoded in XML one is this
more document oriented type of XML which
is really the type of data that XML was
originally designed to encode but then
we can also take a look at something
like this ok now this is actually data
from the open street
project this is a a pretty close zoomed
in view from OpenStreetMap of West
Belmont Avenue particularly the ten
hundred block and you can see right here
there's a Giordano's restaurant here
tear down this is the famous piece of
chain in Chicago so this is data that is
essentially from a layer on top of that
particular map this is data that is
human created so users of OpenStreetMap
have actually added this data on top of
the map data and what I want to point
out here is that this is very much not
document oriented this is just data okay
and a lot of times when you see XML used
in this way you'll see that attributes
are heavily used so in this particular
example this is the node that represents
the Giordano's restaurant we can see
that there are a number of attributes
specified for this particular element
prominent among them are the latitude
and longitude attributes that this
particular annotation applies to so
essentially what this data element
provides is a mapping from geographic
coordinates to more common street
address coordinates okay so this is a
good example of attributes in XML and
there's one other thing that I want to
point out here and that is this type of
tag here now in this particular data
they're doing something that I probably
wouldn't do but is the type of thing
that you're going to see as a data
scientist and likely already have
essentially they've just got a bunch of
key value pairs that are encoded in
something called a tag element and in
this case none of these tag elements
have a close tag instead they use this
special XML syntax where you can simply
create what are called empty tags that
is tags that don't have any content all
of the data for this type of tag is
contained directly within its attributes
so the most emailed example here
provides us a nice example of document
oriented XML with lots of content inside
the elements and this particular example
from the OpenStreetMap project provides
us with the other end of the spectrum
which is very data oriented XML where
all or almost all of the data is
contained within attributes for the
individual elements and in these types
of cases you often have mostly or at
least many empty
within the XML data that you're looking
at</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
