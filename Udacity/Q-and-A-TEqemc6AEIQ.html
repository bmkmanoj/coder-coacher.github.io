test them right now nothing is on the
page there is nothing to add on with it
um so what I would do right now is um to
actually try loading up your game and
then put in console dot log statements
start out with console dot log inside
your enemy dot update function console
dot log inside your player function just
because we are already calling them so
as you can see enemy is going to render
all of this but then after j/s is where
it actually runs the code and loads the
resources and I'm thinking that you're
saying there are no enemies or bugs
inside your canvas that is being
rendered so what you can do is if you
don't know how to start writing the
update function just put in console dot
log or what you can do is you can just
call your enemy render function create
an object here um like how I showed you
how to create our enemy equals new enemy
off and then you can put in the x and y
values of the enemy to just render it on
the screen it does not have to move it
does not have to do any functionality so
try creating one class for one object of
the enemy and try calling the render
function on it um that should be very
helpful console.log is very useful so
use a lot of print statements around um
since I know that inside engine jas you
will be calling enemy dot update and
enemy dot render function here you will
obviously need these functions defined
inside your arm how can your as much in
a file I wanted to make a green bug
because I went into Photoshop and
altered the hue but i get this error
failed to execute draw image on canvas
rendering context 2d the provided value
is not of type HTML image element or
HTML
video element or HTML canvas element
okay um so as long as you save it in a
PNG format and put it inside your images
repository it shouldn't have a problem
um I have known a lot of students
actually putting in different colors to
the bug boy blue yellow green um and it
all all that they have to do is
photoshopped images save it inside your
images repository and then added to your
resources so wherever um I can show it
to you inside one of your JS files um I
believe it is your engine touch a case
file make sure that you are not I'm so
right here you can see that you are
loading all these images and you have
only enemy bug PMG you can name it
yellow bug blue bug whatever color you
said it in but make sure you add it into
the load function and make sure it is
inside your images repository as long as
you're doing that it should work I'm
trying to go to 4 p-3 to detect
collision but when I make a range from
the enemy dot X by creating VAR enemy
x-men equal to animate of X minus 50 i
get an undefined because my enemy done X
was only 34 thus I got a negative number
please let me know how to avoid this
okay well good question Kim this this
part of the project is very tricky now
it surprises me a little bit that you
get an undefined error because these are
integers and subtracting them should
just results in the worst case in as a
negative number which might be off of
your canvas but what I do have is a
great link and so this page as you can
check it out it talks about access to
line bounding box and what you can do
for to test your collisions I don't
think if to worry about circle collision
but just this top one here access a line
bounding box should be enough to get you
started the other thing to think about
too is you
and think about collision as in the
reverse sense so you can think about you
could write a function to say what are
you not colliding and then say what are
you not not colliding that that can
actually be easier math in fact some
time so if that's at all helpful give
that a whirl if you are having questions
about your specific code and this
website doesn't help and the different
way of thinking about it in terms of
doing the opposite of not collide it
doesn't help please place your question
to the discussions and either us or one
of the students can try to help look at
your exact code to see to see what's
going on there p3 is there anything we
should set up for when game mins or user
close window to clear memory allocations
no so this is the beauty of JavaScript
it has automatic garbage collection and
this is a concept in more low-level
programming languages such as C C++ or
even Java is that like the language
itself javascript automatically uh
clears to memory for you like if you
have an object and if that object is not
being referenced by anything else then
the computer to jump the language itself
the javascript is smart enough to know
that okay there's nothing that's
referencing this object anymore in my
memory I'm just going to automatically
clear and you don't need to deal with
garbage collection unlike a low-level
programming language like C C++ what
goes in the index.html file it appears
you have the canvas drawn the engine jjs
file this is a place to build a custom
background thanks so the index dot HTML
file you shouldn't have to add anything
to it um if you wanted to maybe let's
say you wanted to have like a title you
could but if you're too if the custom
background you're referring to if you
want to custom background for your game
kind of like a backdrop then yeah you
could you could edit the CSS and put
like a background image on your body tag
but if you're the background you refer
two is like a game level then you would
need to edit that in engine that Jas
yeah I mean there shouldn't you
shouldn't have to touch the HTML or CSS
files not to pass yeah I don't you want
to do something yeah cool then you'll
have to play with them a little bit I'm
trying to figure out the width and
height of players and bugs the images
are 101 by 171 pixels but that is not
how tall and white the bug in players
are is there a way to figure this out
I'm working on collision and trying to
define the rectangles so actually this
is a really good question and it was
something that I initially had a little
bit of trouble with I like put my player
on the board and he ended up like kind
of oddly sort of off the board a little
bit and I kind of played around with the
measurements until they got they down
there and then I realized like my bugs
were hitting my player if these like
weird angles and I was like all right I
just got to figure out babies are so do
you have a tip for figuring out sort of
the size of the players and the bugs um
I'll tell you the reason it's weird like
that is because it kind of looks like a
top-down game mm-hmm but it's really not
if you look at the very bottom row it's
a square but then it has that you see
the VA square right so what happens is
when those squares are drawn there the
top layer is drawn and then the the top
rows drawn then the second row was drawn
sort of on top of that bottom piece a
little bit and so they're oddly stacked
um I would say that the the player and
the bugs should be sized as to the top
of those images and not the what the
pool like actual images kind of ignore
that bottom little piece there what I
did in my implementation was I actually
kind of defined an object that said like
row 1 is this y coordinate row 2 is this
y coordinate and then I used that object
of okay my player is on Row 1 and my
bugs are on Row 1 so that's now I can
actually like work on collision and
stuff it is it is weird the matter math
can get odd I for some reason 7
threes in my head I think I think that
was my head 73 pixels was my number um I
don't know what mine ended up being I
think mine ended up being like 30 or 80
or something I don't remember yeah it
was one of those things that I mean it
really did just take trial in her yeah
to get it right but if I guess that's
kind of part of making a game kind of
shuffling things a little bit too late
they fit together yeah so I mean what I
ventually did was I created like a step
size variable for the player and so I
said like any time I press up he's going
to move vertically this much space and
then I would just constantly i would
adjust that I would set that to like 60
pixels and then I reload the game and
press up up up and if it looked like he
was staying in the center of the blocks
it boxes all the way up then I had the
right number um if he was going too far
not far enough that I just did that
number and then I did the same thing
with y step for next steps you know
horizontal and just tweaked it and
played with it it didn't take long well
yeah I mean once I just because I did
the same thing as used I was trying
because I was just handed these images
and so I mean I I did the same thing as
you would try to define you know think
about it logically and define it and it
really did for me just become a practice
of all right just define a number and
figure and tweak it and figure it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
