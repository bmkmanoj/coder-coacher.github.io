like you to do is get a basic web app
online this is going to be the
foundation for what we're doing in the
rest of this class so step one will be
install Google App Engine will include
documentation and the course notes for
how to do this and you can also use
Google's own you know own instructions
online and we want to install the Python
version put online a basic app that all
it has to do is print out the words
hello Udacity nothing fancy just
basically get this thing online and when
you've got that working submit the URL
here I'll show you what it looks like on
on my browser or my version of it here
we are this is a this is what I've
installed you can see it's running on
appspot comm which is Google App engines
domain by default and all it does this
has a simple web page that prints out
hello Udacity this is the entire
homework if you get this working you
have succeeded for some of you this
should only take 15 minutes or so but I
realized that installing you know
installing Web Apps and packages and
things like this can sometimes be
troublesome so once we've got this
working we'll have a good foundation to
build on for the rest of the course okay
good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
