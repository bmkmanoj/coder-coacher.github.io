just want to remind you about I
mentioned them earlier but a common
startup error on day one is let's price
on cost we know how much it takes to
build our product we'll just add a
markup that is a profit and and
therefore we have a price web how hard
can that be this is typically not a
strategic way to price you might end up
here but boy there's a lot more moves on
the table what you really want to think
about is not just your internal
economics but the customer insight that
you actually have so I want you to think
about yes
pricing on cost is maybe the first place
we start but are we leaving a ton of
money on the table because the
alternative to pricing on cost is
pricing on value as we said earlier you
now know your customer segments
perception of the value of your value
prop is it about time saved new
efficiency created remember we talked
earlier about pains and gains for this
customer segment what is it that they
value why are you saving them a ton of
money now customers don't necessarily
feel that they want to pay this way but
smart marketeers and smart startup
executives can convince customers that
instead of paying on cost they really
ought to be thinking about that your
company is unique and providing the most
value not just the cheapest product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
