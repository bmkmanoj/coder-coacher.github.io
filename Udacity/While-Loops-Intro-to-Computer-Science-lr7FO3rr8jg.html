but we are going to introduce one and
that's going to make writing the code we
need for our search engine much more
convenient it's also going to be very
useful for lots and lots of procedures
that we'll want to write and the
construct we're going to introduce is
called the loop it's a way to do things
over and over again the kind of loop
that we're going to introduce first is
called a while loop the syntax for the
while loop is this we have the keyword
while followed by a test expression
followed by a colon and then inside we
have a block and the block is a sequence
of instructions this is very similar to
the if statement so as a reminder here's
what the if statement looks like we had
an if followed by a test expression
followed by a colon and then an indented
block which is a list of statements that
execute whenever the test expression
evaluates to a true value with if the
block executes either 0 or 1 times
depending on whether the test expression
is true with while the block can execute
any number of times it keeps going as
long as the test expression is true so
with an if statement if the test
expression is true we go to the block
run the block and then continue if the
test expression was false we go right to
the next expression with awhile we also
start by checking the test expression if
it's true we go to the block but now
instead of going to the next statement
after the block we go back we try the
test expression again if it's true we go
back to the block we always go back to
the test expression if it's true we do
the block again we go back to the test
expression if it's true again we do the
block again we go back to the test
expression and we can keep going around
as many times as we need as long as the
test expression is true
we'll keep executing the block and keep
trying the test expression again at some
point maybe the test expression is false
once the test expression is false we go
to the next extra instruction so this
means a while loop can execute the block
either 0 times if the test expression
was false at the beginning one time it
was true the first time but false after
that 2 times 3 times any number of times
it could keep going forever
there's no requirement
that guarantees the test expression
eventually becomes false so here's an
example while loop we start by
initializing the variable I and will
give it the value 0 then we have the
while the test expression says I is less
than 10 so that means as long as this
evaluates to true we'll evaluate the
block and what the block does is print I
and then add 1 to I so here's what
happens when this executes
so initially the value of I is 0 I is
less than 10 so that means we'll enter
the loop so that means the test
expression is true so we'll enter the
block we'll print I so we'll see the
value 0 printed and then we'll do the
assignment so that will change the value
of i we add 1 to I so that's going to be
making the value of I now we're first to
1 so if it was an F we'd be done now but
because it's a while we keep going we go
back test again if I is less than 10 now
the value of I is 1 which also is less
than 10 so we continue go to the block
again we're going to print I this time
we'll see the value of 1 then we go to
the next statement increase the value of
I by 1 that's going to make the value of
I 2 now I refers to the number 2 because
it's a while we keep going we go back to
the test expression is less than 10
still less than 10 because now it's 2
we're going to print the 2 we're going
to add 1 that will make the value of I 3
and we're going to keep going
we do the test again nine is still less
than 10 so we're going to print by again
we will print the value nine then we add
one so that's going to add one to nine
we'll get 10 and so that's the new value
of I and we go back again and now we do
is less than 10 and now I has the value
10 10 is not less than 10 so that will
be false and we're done with the while
loop will continue with whatever
statements here in this case there is
none so at the end of the loop what
we've done we've gone through it 10
times we've printed the numbers from 0
to 9 the new value of I will be 10 if we
do anything here that uses the value of
I will see that the value of I is 10 so
to see that you understand why loops
we'll have a quiz so the question is
what does this program do here's the
program we start by assigning 0 to I we
have a while loop where the test is not
equal to 10 so the test is I is not
equal to 10 then we have I equals I plus
1 so we're assigning to I the value of I
plus 1 and then we're printing I so this
is similar to the example but different
in a couple ways so it's up to you to
see if you can figure out what the
program does
try to figure it out yourself you can
certainly also try running this in the
Python interpreter
the choices are produce an error print
out the numbers from 0 to 9 print out
the numbers from 1 to 9 print out the
numbers from 1 to 10 or the final choice
is it runs forever or at least until our
machine runs out of power so see if you
can figure out what it does you can
definitely try running it but try to
figure out on your own before running it
in the Python interpreter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
