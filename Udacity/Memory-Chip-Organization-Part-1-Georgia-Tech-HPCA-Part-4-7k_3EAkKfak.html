memory looks like now let's see how the
whole chip is organized we said already
that we have these word lines that
activate cells we have a number of word
lines and the thing that decides which
word line gets activated is called a row
decoder what we give to the row decoder
is some bits of the address that tell it
which of the word lines to activate it
can only activate one word line at a
time so this is a real decoder you give
it a number it activates a line that
corresponds to that number in memory we
call this row address there is also a
bit line here and if you remember a
memory cell exists at every intersection
between this bit line and a word line so
what the word line does is it connects
this cell this cell this cell or this
cell to the bit line so by supplying
let's say 2 bits of the address we
choose which of the four bits would be
outputting on this 1 bit line of course
there are more bit lines than just one
and this for example is a 16 bit memory
it's a four by four bit memory four bits
can output to the same bit line and
there are four bits activated by each of
the word lines so when we select the row
four bits get output out of here now bit
lines are very long and as we said the
cell is either a relatively weak SRAM
cell so it will slowly pull the bit line
one way or the other or it is a dealer
and cell that these charges are
relatively small capacitor into this
relatively long bit line if we discharge
a small capacitor into a long bit line
the voltage and the bit line will change
but it will change relatively little it
will not change all the way to the level
that corresponds to a 1 or 2 a 0 if we
have a weak cell we don't want to wait
for that cell to raise the whole bit
line one way or the other this is why
the bit lines are connect
give to a device called sense amplifier
what it does is it senses the small
changes on the bit line and amplifies
them so it's really helping the cell
raise or lower the voltage on the bit
line and it has relatively powerful
circuitry for each bit line so it's
significantly bigger than a single row
of cells but you only need one of these
at the end of the bit line you don't
need one of these at every cell so you
have relatively small and weak cells and
you have this beefy thing here that is
helping them raise or lower the bit line
the signals that are produced by the
sense amplifier which are now correctly
one or zero bits go to a storage element
called row buffer the row buffer stores
the correct values that we read from the
whole row of cells so in this case the
row buffer will contain four bits
because that's how many bits are there
in the row the row buffer feeds the data
it latched to another decoder that is
called the column decoder this decoder
selects the correct bit among these four
let's say using the : address which is
another part of the data address and it
outputs a single bit if we want to build
something that has more than just one
bit of data for each location we will
replicate this so we will have let's say
two of these give them the same row and
column address and now they output a two
bit value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
