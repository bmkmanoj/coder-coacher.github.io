viewcontroller.swift this is the file
that has the record audio function
remember this is the function that gets
called when the user presses the
microphone button in here
I want to write some code that records
the user's voice but before I do that I
want to change the name of this file
right now it's called a generic
viewcontroller.swift since the majority
of what we want to do in this file is
record the user's audio or sound I want
to change the name of this file to
record sounds view controller to do that
requires me to do four main things see
if you can follow along I will change
the name of the file in the navigator I
can call it record sounds view
controller then I will scroll up to the
top of the file and change this comment
I will also change the name of the class
and then finally I will go to storyboard
and in here I will select the first
scene and then drag out utility area and
underneath identity inspector I will
select the new name for this class which
is record sounds view controller okay
let me see if these changes are still
working let me click on this microphone
button and then the stop and try and
play some audio my mom always said life
was like a box of chocolates
alright the movie quote is still playing
that looks good in the next video I will
search for how to record the users voice
in our app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
