with investor with an angel investor
called oven and i gave the pitch of my
life and he was convinced i felt that he
he fell for me and the second in the
second meeting i bought my team members
and he said yeah amazing let's do it and
somewhere in doing the meeting he told
me norm I have a feeling that you have a
feeling that I'm in your pocket you know
what let's stop it right there you go
and get five more investors to give the
same amount of money that i'm going to
give you and then i'll give you my money
what do you say about that I said what
really why I thought I thought that
we're doing this no I want more people
to participate in this song and you know
what I want you to bring in an engine
whistle called Giggy levy and that time
and still Maggie galleri was the most
notable angel investor in Israel and I
and Giggy was like a celebrity for Meg I
don't know him he said the I go do that
go to that that we will test and i went
from that meeting with my team members
some somewhere between humiliated too
disappointed too what's going on I
really thought that we're going to start
operating but no so the next day I just
like this fat how am I going to approach
this person and I was so so I was I was
the okeus of the cookies and I I didn't
know anyone so the best my best chart
was just to facebook message this this
engine so so my best my best chance was
to facebook message this angel investor
and this is a huge nono everybody will
tell you this is so good don't do it
it's it's so a matured so unprofessional
buddy but I did it and he answered right
away three days later we had a meeting
we had an amazing meeting and he decided
to invest and this guy became my mentor
one of my favorite person on earth and
he invested not once not twice four
times in 9 my companies and now he's
following he followed us to the next
company and he's that I'm excited to
talk about him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
