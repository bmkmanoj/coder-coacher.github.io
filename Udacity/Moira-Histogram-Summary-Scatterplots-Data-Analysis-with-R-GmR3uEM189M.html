the relationship between age and friend
count and we did that using conditional
means we'll return to these two
variables later and we'll see their
relationship to a third variable in
lesson 5 but for now let's see how more
used a slightly different approach to
pair a histogram to summarize her raw
data so here's an example of how we
paired raw data with summary data so
here we have these scatter plots where
we're showing people's raw guesses of
their perceived audience size against
their actual audience size and you can
see they all fall below the perfect
accuracy lines people underestimate but
it's still kind of hard to get it the
big picture from these scatter plots and
so we use some histograms to capture
more summary data in this case these two
histograms show how much people over or
underestimated their audience size so
here on the left at the zero mark on the
x-axis that's how many people guess
their audience size perfectly if they
had a lighter color blue those are
people that underestimated their
audience so you can kind of see how many
people underestimated their audience by
about twenty five percent versus fifty
percent versus seventy-five percent and
so on the darker blue are people who
overestimated their audience size and
you can just see from the chart far
fewer people overestimated their
audience size if you look on the right
side of these submarines this is for
people's over-under estimations when you
ask them about the whole month how many
people in general do you think see your
post and you can see that people don't
underestimate quite as badly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
