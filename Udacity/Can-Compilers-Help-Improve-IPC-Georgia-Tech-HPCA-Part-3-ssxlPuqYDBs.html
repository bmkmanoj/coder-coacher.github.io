improve IPC which is the number of
instructions per cycle that the
processor achieves there are really two
things that the compiler can help with
one is the ILP of the program itself may
be limited for example due to dependence
chains which is when we have
instructions that depend on each other
so really if we have a long chain like
this then there would be very limited
ILP in this program because we can
really execute only one instruction at a
time so the compiler as we will see
might help us actually avoid these kinds
of dependence chains and also the
hardware has a limited window into the
program for example there might be
independent instructions so an ideal
processor might be able to achieve good
ILP on that program but because these
independent instructions are far apart a
real processor simply cannot see those
instructions because for example it runs
out of Rob space before it reaches those
instructions that are independent so in
the same example if we have a long chain
like this followed by this instruction
doesn't depend on any of those in the
chain but if the chain is too long we
run out of our OB space before we reach
this instruction so as far as this
processor is concerned this instruction
cannot execute in parallel with those
just because we never see it as we will
see the compiler can help us put these
independent instructions closer to each
other so that the IPC achieved by the
processor is closer to the available ILP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
