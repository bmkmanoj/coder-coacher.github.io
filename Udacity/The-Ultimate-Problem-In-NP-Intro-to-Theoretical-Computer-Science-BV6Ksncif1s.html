be tempted to think that because I just
called it the ultimate problem in NP but
actually when you look at the definition
of an np-complete problem it just means
that any other problem in NP can be
reduced to it so there could be multiple
np-complete problems as long as they
have the same hardness so this here is
not true if you found a polynomial time
algorithm for an np-complete problem
then what that would mean is that there
would also be polynomial time algorithms
for all other problems in NP and the
reason for that is that for an
np-complete problem we have said that
any other problem in NP can be reduced
to it and that can be done in polynomial
time so if you can solve this problem in
polynomial time as well then you
automatically have a polynomial time
algorithm for any problem that you can
find an NP and finally if vertex cover
would be an np-complete problem then
click would be an np-complete problem as
well because we have shown that you can
use polynomial time reductions to get
from vertex cover to clique and vice
versa so from a perspective of
polynomial time versus exponential time
hardness those two problems are
basically equally hard to solve so this
one here is also true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
