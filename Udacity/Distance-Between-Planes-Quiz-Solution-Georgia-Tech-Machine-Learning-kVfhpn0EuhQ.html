there's the answer to the question that
I thought you were asking and then there
was the question that you then at the
end actually asked it seems like at the
end you asked what is the difference
between the two the distance between the
two lines and I feel that like that's
just the like the norm of X 1 minus X 2
but the difference between these
equations is going to be well w
transpose Y now write down what you're
telling me over in the side over here
and then we can put the final answer in
the box okay okay so it's what now W
transpose X 1 minus X 2 equals 2 right
so you used the power of subtraction to
make that work ok very good ok so that's
the difference between those two
equations now how am I going to go from
there to figuring out the distance
between X 1 and X 2 I still feel like
it's just the norm of X 1 minus X 2 ok
but I want you to tell it to me in terms
of W and what I want you to tell to me
in terms of W because the only thing
that we have to play with here is W well
W and B that's what defines our line and
so I want to find the right line the
only thing I get to play with W and B so
I'd like to know something about the
relationship between W and the distance
between x1 and x2 well W transpose times
their difference is - that's true that's
not that's not telling us the distance
though so what is the distance in terms
of W well what if I told you W was a
number what would you do if it was just
a simple scalar and you had this
equation and I wanted to know what x1
minus x2 was what would you do and I
wanted it in terms of W yeah I wanted to
know what X 1 minus X 2 was equal to I
see so if I divide it by W that would be
helpful because then X 1 minus X 2 would
be 2 over W right but you can't do that
because W is a vector and you can't
really divide by a vector at least not
in the world that we're talking about so
how are you going to make that work
would you like a hint sure well here's a
hint we want to move W over from one
side to the other we could start doing
all kinds of tricks with inverses online
with the inverse of the vectors there's
all kinds of things that you could do
but actually the easiest way of doing it
is getting rid of W on one side and the
easiest way of doing that is to divide
both sides by the length of W so rather
than dividing both sides by W we divide
them by the length of W now what is
dividing W by the length of W give you
so right so W divided by the length of W
is a normalized version of W so it's
like something that points in the same
direction as W but sits on the unit
sphere right now that's exactly right in
fact it is a sphere because it's a it's
a hypersphere
I suppose right so we do that and that
effectively is like giving you a value
one like you said it's a unit sphere and
so now we're actually talking about the
difference the disk the difference
between the vector X 1 and the vector X
2 projected on to the unit sphere and
that's equal to 2 over the linklater X 1
minus X 2 s naught is projected onto the
vector W vector the normalized W vector
right the SS on the normalized total
normalized right u vector right so does
that help you ah
I don't know does that actually answer
the question doesn't seem like it does
oh no it does so is that okay all right
so the X 1 minus X 2 dotted with W so W
at W we don't know it could be anything
can it so mm-hmm we've taken X 1 minus X
2 projected onto W so it's like the
length of X 1 minus X 2 but in the W
direction exactly that's exactly right
so the link which by the way is what is
exactly right so what we've just done is
we have found the length of X 1 and X 2
in the W direction what do we know about
W with relationship to the line to be
use the parameters to line yes but in
particular is the case with any
hyperplane W actually represents a
vector that's perpendicular to ha and
since we chose X 1 and X 2 so that they
would in fact their distance or their
difference with in fact be perpendicular
to the line what we've just done is
projected that those the
the difference between those two vectors
onto something that is also
perpendicular to the line and so what
that ends up giving us is in fact its
length so we maximize the length of x1
minus x2 by doing what with W I see so
if the thing on the left is in fact if
we answered the quiz yet by the way are
we still working on that I'm going to
say we're still working on oh man all
right this is a hard quiz so good so the
thing on the left the whole thing on the
left not just where the braces are that
actually turns out to be the distance
between the two hyperplanes
right let's uh let's give that a letter
let's call it m mm-hmm and we're saying
that equals 2 over the norm of W and
that's so if we want to maximize that
the only thing we have to play with is W
and that is made larger and larger as W
gets smaller and smaller
in other words like pushing it towards
the origin right so it's set W to all
zeros and we should be golden
right except if we push all the W is to
zero we might not be able to correctly
classify our points but what this does
tell us is that we have a way of
thinking about the distance of this
vector and where the decision boundary
ought to be we want to find the
parameters of the hyperplane such that
we maximize this distance over here
represented by this equation while still
being consistent with the data which
makes sense because that's actually what
we said in the first place by the way
this thing has a name and it's the
reason why I chose M it's called the
margin and what all of this exercise
tells you is that your goal is define a
decision boundary that maximizes the
margin subject to the constraint that
you actually want to correctly classify
everything and that is represented by
that term now somehow it feels like
having gone through all this we ought to
be able to use it for something and turn
it into some other problem we might be
able to solve might be able to maximize
for so that we can actually find the
best line and it turns out we can do
that have we answered the quiz yet oh
yeah we did which is in fact what I
wanted so the end
is Wow somebody gets that that would be
a very impressive that would be very
impressive or anything similar to this I
would accept and in fact I probably
better will okay good so it turns out
that this whole notion of thinking about
finding the optimal decision boundary is
the same as finding a line that
maximizes the margin and we can take
what we've just learned where we've
decided the goal is to maximize to over
the length of W and turn it into a
problem where we can solve this directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
