people who grow up in the same family
can grow up in different environments
well birth orders one way this can
happen and by birth order we just simply
mean whether your first child or second
child or fourth child or whatever now
birth order really can affect our
personalities in general the evidence
suggests that firstborn children for
example tend to be more conservative
they tend to be more responsible and
they tend to have a higher self esteem
and then latter born children people
second and third and forth and so on
tend to be more rebellious and challenge
the status quo in fact the psychologist
Frank soloway wrote a book called born
to rebel and it was all about birth
order and he studied the history of
science and politics and the reason he
chose these two areas was because they
have revolutions pretty regularly new
ideas come on and he wanted to see who
accepted and who rejected these new
revolutionary ideas and as it turns out
the best predictor of who accepted and
rejected these new ideas was birth order
firstborn children tended to reject new
ideas in science and politics and latter
born children tended to accept them so
birth order really does affect our
personalities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
