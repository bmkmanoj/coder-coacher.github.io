radii great work if you figured each of
them out let's start by focusing on the
center remember the center is at H comma
K and we take the sign that's opposite
and this parenthesis so we know the
x-coordinate here is positive 1 and the
y coordinate of the center is positive 2
this is the H value this is the K value
for the second one will have negative 3
for the x-coordinate of our center this
is our H value and will have positive 3
for the y-coordinate of our center this
is the K value and notice that since
these signs match we just take the
positive 3 4 k whereas here we have to
have negative 3 for the value of H this
third one might have been tricky will
have positive 7 for the x-coordinate of
our center and will have zero for the
y-coordinate of our center there's
nothing or subtracted in parentheses for
this Y so we know the K value is just 0
and finally for the last one we'll have
negative 4 comma 2 for this center we
change the sign here and we change the
sign here now let's focus on the radius
if we take the square root of the number
on the end we get the radius so the
square root of 16 equals for the square
root of 1 equals 1 and the square root
of 49 equals 7 for this last one we'll
take the square root of 8 which really
equals 2 root 2 now you could have just
written square root of 8 and that would
have been correct as well these two are
the same number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
