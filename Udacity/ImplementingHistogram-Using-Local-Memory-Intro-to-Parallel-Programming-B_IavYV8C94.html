Atomics have limited scalability because
the Atomics limit the amount of
parallelism if we have 100 bins and use
Atomics to access them then no matter
how awesome a GPU we might have we're
still only doing a hundred useful things
at a time thus there's interest in
algorithms that might be a little bit
more complex but might scale better so
we'll look at a reduced based method
next so let's say we have a large number
of items to place into our histogram but
relatively few bins now we're going to
consider a pretty small example here for
the sake of discussion just so we can
draw everything that we need to and for
the sake of discussion we're going to
say we have 128 items to place into bins
we have 8 threads that we've launched
take care of these items and we only
have three bins so we're gonna divide
those 128 items among the 8 threads so
each thread will be responsible for 16
items now rather than have only one
single set of 3 bins in memory let's
launch eight threads and give every
thread its own set of bins which we'll
call its local histogram since we don't
have very many bins we can store each
threads bins in that threads registers
which are fast now we have sixteen items
per thread and each thread can
independently accumulate its own local
histogram and its own registers so we
get eight separate local histograms each
of which has accumulated 16 items which
isn't particularly useful what we
actually need is one global histogram
rather than eight local histograms quick
quiz do we need to use Atomics to manage
access to these local per thread
histograms yes or no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
