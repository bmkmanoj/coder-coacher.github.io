really go where no one has gone before
you want to generate an authentic
contribution to some field based on the
information you gather based on the
models that you construct a fit your
data but what that means is that you're
not going to have the same kind of
support you might be used to in doing
this project Udacity coaches won't be
able to help you because you're doing
all new things that they've never seen
before your peer reviewer is similarly
they might be able to give you some idea
about the strengths and weaknesses of
your approach but they don't have expert
knowledge about how to work in a domain
that you're working it and that's
actually the really exciting thing about
this final project you're not just doing
a project for a nano degree program
that's going to be a you know I feather
in your cap you're really doing
something authentic you're generating
authentic conclusions on authentic
analysis about real data out in the
world the project you'll generate here
is something that you should be proud to
walk into someone's office and tell them
about because it really represents your
mastery of machine learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
