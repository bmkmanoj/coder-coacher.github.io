creating our animation with our update
function including things like filtering
our data removing and adding any new
elements need to be placed on the page
as well as dealing with the data binding
key function which determine which
elements to add or remove III has great
support for built-in transitions and all
you need to do to make the transition
smooth is use D threes special built-in
functions one of which is transition
which kicks off a transition and the
second most-used
is the duration in this case we make our
selection we append anything that needs
to be appended and then kick off a
transition that takes 500 milliseconds
and what actually changes during the
transition well that's what comes after
it all of these attributes which move
the circles and set their radius
take 500 milliseconds to complete and
operate on the enter selection and the
circles we are appending so now when
we're adding circles they'll transition
more smoothly but also potentially more
importantly we want the countries to
transition smoothly so following the
exact same syntax we place transition
with a duration of 500 milliseconds
right before we change the fill and the
stroke of countries to update and hide
our show based on the year of the World
Cup I would say this is one reason to
use d3 built-in style functions to add
style to our elements rather than using
CSS so we can have much more flexibility
in how we animate and apply those Styles
as you can see here the countries
transition out and in much smoother than
they did before since we added the
transition to the Styles applied to the
countries as well as the circles as they
come in and get placed at the respective
home country they belong on top of and
now that we've finished our map or at
least the animation of it we can start
to see a little story unfolding can you
find an error
in the graphic we've created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
