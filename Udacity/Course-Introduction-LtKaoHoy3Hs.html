instructor for this short course on
Swift syntax Swift is already having a
huge impact on the iOS development it's
fast concise easy to read and comes with
tools like playgrounds that make it
easier than ever to visualize your code
a welcoming language for beginner and
intermediate programmers Swift makes the
road to building your own iOS apps
considerably less steep fantastic
resources for learning Swift are easy to
find not least among them is Apple's
guide the Swift programming language
which we hope you'll come to rely on as
a reference this course hopes to offer
something that is less common among
other Swift resources practice
throughout the course we'll be working
through examples together and each
lesson will end with a set of exercises
to get you more comfortable with Swift's
idiosyncrasies we'll start out with some
basics of types and operators and
practice manipulating strings and
declaring variables and constants then
we'll move on to what is arguably Swizz
most unique and confounding feature
optional types we'll talk about
collections and control flow including
lots of practice with switch statements
functions and classes enumerations and
structs which are considerably more
powerful and swift than in other
languages protocols and we'll wrap
things up by exploring closure
expressions which can be tricky at first
but wonderfully convenient once you get
the hang of them this course is designed
for programmers who have some prior
object-oriented experience for students
who through work with other languages
are already familiar with most of the
concepts I've just listed so let's get
started with Swift types</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
