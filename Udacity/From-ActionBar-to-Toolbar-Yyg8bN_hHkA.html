widget this generalization of the action
bar pattern gives you much more control
and flexibility tool bars of view in
your hierarchy just like any other
making it easier to interleave with the
rest of your views animate and react to
scroll events many Android apps now have
two or more toolbars as in this example
toolbars are made particularly important
because of the design rule that we
aren't supposed to split a toolbar with
another piece of material this means
that we often need multiple toolbars
fortunately we have a fully functional
version that has been built as part of
the android support library in order to
make use of toolbar we need to first
change our application to use a theme
that doesn't add an action bar on our
behalf I'm going to create a base
toolbar style that gives it a background
color toolbars have transparent
backgrounds by default we'll also make
sure that we're using the light pop of
theme this will be important when we
said the toolbars to the dark theme in
our layout so that we can have light
colored text that will pop against our
dark background I can make all of my
toolbars get this new style by placing a
toolbar style in the app theme then we
just add the toolbar into our layout
note that I'm setting the size to be the
standard action bar size from the
current theme using the question mark at
our notation and I'm setting the theme
to be the overlay theme for dark this
will nicely style us with light text
finally I can make the toolbar behave
like an action bar by setting it into
the activity using set support action
bar once it's there I could apply action
bar styling to it using get support
action bar I could use these functions
to get the icon back but I want to
demonstrate one other cool thing about
tool bar it contains a view group that
you can customize this view group is
like an even more simple frame layout so
we could add our logo back to the
toolbar this way this level of control
become useful as we continue to work
towards our new design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
