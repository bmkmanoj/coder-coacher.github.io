actually true with only one function in
our program will have our top level
global environment and then the
environment for our new function and
we're making its declaration or its
parent pointer go back here to the
global environment that's where it
should go but that's also where the bug
is putting it so we won't be able to
tell the difference now if this weren't
an anonymous function but we're instead
a recursive function like factorial we
might be able to see the bug with only
one but with just one anonymous function
we can't quite see the bug we need at
least three variables in the global
environment to see the bug this isn't
really true one variable in the global
environment one local variable maybe
even know variables in the global
environment should be totally fine the
only time that parent pointer matters is
when we're looking up a variable in a
child environment and we don't find it
locally so we should be able to
construct a test case that has just one
such a variable like the a in the Balder
example we did earlier we won't need
three we can show the bug with only two
functions each separately declared at
the top level if I have another function
function to declared at the top level
its parent pointer should point back to
global and because of the bug it will
point back to global anyway so this
won't let us see the bug we can show the
bug with one function nested inside
another this is the plan let's say we
have function one with function two
nested inside of it the parent pointer
for function one or this pointer should
go back to global the bug will make it
go back to global function two should
point back to function one but the bug
will make it point to global so all I
have to do is put some variable a in
here and have function to refer to it
then in my test case we won't find it
will get an error but in the real world
we should find it and that will allow me
to pin down the defect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
