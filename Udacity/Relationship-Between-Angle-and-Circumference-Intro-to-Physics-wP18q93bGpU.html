the Sun is very straight vertically
Alexandria where they strike at an angle
alpha and this angle alpha is the same
as this angle alpha and we're hoping we
can use that to calculate the
circumference well let's see we know
there's 360 degrees in a full circle
this alpha is going to represent some
fraction of that 360 degrees maybe a
half maybe a quarter we don't know yet
what we do know is that the ratio of
this length I'm going to call this
length D to the full circumference of
the earth must be equal to the ratio of
this angle over 360 degrees now I'll
talk about that more in a second but
let's just write that down the ratio of
this distance D to the full
circumference of the earth is also equal
to the ratio of alpha to 360 degrees a
good way to confirm that this equation
makes sense is let's think of some
limiting cases
what if alpha were 0 so that would be a
really really tiny angle covering
absolutely no distance 0 over 360 equals
0 that would mean this length would have
to be 0 as well good
now what if alpha were a full 360
degrees
what would D have to be for this formula
to make sense check the appropriate box
would D have to be 0 1 or C the
circumference of the earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
