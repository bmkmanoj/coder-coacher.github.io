better for slight differences in your
data and what you're trying to
communicate in practice you can get by
with only a few in navigating this
jungle I like to often start from first
principles chart types are simply a set
of visual encodings applied to data
types and combined with some
relationship between those data for
example a scatterplot is in x-coordinate
and y-coordinate with the shape in this
case a circle as applied to two
continuous variables continuous being
their data type in which the y-value is
dependent on the x value which
corresponds to the relationship between
them and combining all three of these
things you get the chart type of a
scatter plot as you can imagine there
are quite a few combinations of these
three sets a set of the visual encodings
possible the set of data types possible
in a set of relationships between your
data types
I think this flowchart does a fairly
good job of categorizing the different
chart types by utility but I'll also add
that I think if you are missing and I do
have a few qualms about how Andrew
chooses his branches about which chart
to use given which situation when
choosing a chart type I usually either
start with the type and dimension of my
data or what relationships I'm trying to
convey between my different columns for
example I might ask myself how many
dimensions do I have one dimension to
dimension three dimensions and what type
is each continuous categorical am I
trying to compare two variables am I
trying to show how one variable is
distributed let's take that last
question as a starting point let's say I
have one dimensional data then I'm
trying to see the distribution of I
would use either a histogram for
continuous data and I might possibly
want to bin it or a bar chart for
categorical data if I might have some
discrete values along the x axis that
don't have any intrinsic order if I want
to show a comparison of distributions
I'll use either a box plot or small
multiples as they represent
distributions of multiple variables side
by side with each other we will get into
what each of these looks like in just a
second
but I want to mention them as you are
talking about chart types to represent
distributions of data types and
variables to represent a correlation
between two variables where the Y
variable is dependent on the X variable
a scatterplot is the most effective way
and the most commonly known a scatter
plot can be generalized to a bubble
chart putting an additional dimension
and visual encoding to represent in this
case the bubble chart uses size of each
of its circles to represent a third
variable a subtlety of the scatter plot
is that the X variable is usually
assumed to be independent and
uncorrelated with the other X values
what does this mean exactly well let's
consider time series data when dealing
with time every data point is implicitly
dependent on all the data points that
came earlier in time before it in this
situation we want to use a line chart or
a multiple line chart to represent time
series data that one has intrinsic order
and two has data points that are
dependent on what came before them with
line charts the fact that every point is
connected shows a trend in your data and
implies that every data point does have
this inherent connection between them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
