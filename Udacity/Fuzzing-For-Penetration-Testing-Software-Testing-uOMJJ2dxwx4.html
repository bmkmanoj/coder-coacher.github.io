believe it was not too long after about
2000 is that the term fuzzing took on
another connotation and in this
connotation fuzzing basically means
penetration testing and what I mean by
that is fuzzing is used for a very
specific purpose which is finding
security vulnerabilities and
applications and usually the connotation
is is that the fuzzing is being done in
applications that the person doing the
fuzzing didn't write so for example we
might do is find some sort of a machine
on the internet that offers a service
and we'll do random testing over the
Internet of that service with the goal
of finding bugs in the service that are
gonna let us mount an attack such as a
denial of service or some sort of an
exploitable some sort of an exploitable
vulnerability that'll let us in that'll
let us mount an intrusion on that
internet service sort of interesting
thing about this newer connotation of
fuzzing is it's really gotten rather big
so for example plenty of special-purpose
tools are available both commercial and
open source for performing fuzzing over
the network the best of these contain a
lot of kin knowledge about protocols
that would allow a relatively unskilled
user to find bugs in services that are
available over the network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
