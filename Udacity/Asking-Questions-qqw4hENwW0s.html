good questions on the forum these are
just some best practice guidelines to
ensure that you get the best answer that
you're looking for first try searching
for answers before posting your question
on the forum first search to see if
anyone else has asked the same question
you also might try google to see if you
can get an answer that way if that
doesn't work go ahead and start a new
post you also want to be specific when
asking your question and posting your
problem for example if you're having
trouble with a problem set question let
the core staff know what steps you've
taken so they can reproduce the problem
state what you expected to see and what
you got instead finally you might want
to provide details about the Machine
you're using make sure to use concise
and informative subject headlines
include the important details in the
subject header so others can quickly
grasp what your post is going to be
about note that you're limited to 100
characters in a subject line on Piazza
and only the first 30 to 40 characters
are visible in the summary view so make
sure to put the important keywords first
finally be courteous a little courtesy
never hurt anyone if you find the
solution make sure to follow up and
resolve the issue and thank people who
helped you this brings up another point
if you see a question that you yourself
know the answer to feel free to chime in
and help out your classmates now let's
talk a little bit about what not to do
don't post answers to graded assignments
or even ungraded assignments on the
forum without first talking to the
instructor don't ask others to debug
your code without giving details of the
problem that they should be searching
for depending on your class policies
your instructor may restrict you from
posting code at all make sure to ask
your instructor in advance before
posting large sections of code each
class is a little bit different about
the policies around posting code and
other sorts of information when in doubt
please ask your instructor for specific
guidelines about what is allowed to be
posted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
