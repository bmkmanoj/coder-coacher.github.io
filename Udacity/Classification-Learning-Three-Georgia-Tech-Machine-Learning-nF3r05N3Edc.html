set is a set of all of our inputs like
pictures of people paired with a label
which is the correct output so in this
case yes this person is creditworthy
versus another example you can tell them
creditworthy based on my curly hair
purely on the hair versus someone who
has no curly hair and therefore is
obviously not creditworthy and if you
get bunch of bunches of examples of
input and output pairs that's a training
set and that's what's going to be the
basis for you figuring out what is the
correct concept or func I see so instead
of just telling me what tall means
you're going to give me lots of examples
of this is tall this is not tall this is
tall this is tall this is tall this is
not tall and that's the way that you're
explaining what the target concept is
right so if you want to think think
about this in the real world it's as if
we're walking down the street and I'm
pointing out cars to you and non cars to
you rather than trying to give you a
dictionary that defines exactly what a
car is and that is fundamentally
inductive learning as we talked about
before lots and lots of examples lots of
labels now I have to generalize beyond
that so last few things that we we we
talked about last two terms I want to
introduce a candidate and testing set so
what's a candidate well candidate is
just simply the concept that you think
might be the target concept so for
example I might have right now you
already did this we said oh okay I see
clearly I'm creditworthy because I have
curly hair so you've effectively
asserted a particular function that
looks at looks for curly hair and says
if there's curly hair there person's
creditworthy which is certainly how i
think about it and people who are not
curly hair do not have curly hair are in
fact not creditworthy so that's your
target concept and so the question is
given that you have a bunch of examples
and you have a particular candidate or a
candidate concept how do you know
whether you're right or wrong how do you
know whether it's a good candidate or
not
and that's where the testing set comes
in so a testing set looks just like a
training set so here our training set
will have pictures and whether someone
turns out to be creditworthy or
and I will take your candidate concept
and I will determine whether it does a
good job or not by looking at the
testing set so in this case because you
decided curly hair matters
I have draw I've given you two examples
from a training set both of which have
curly hair but only one of which is Dean
creditworthy which means your target
concept probably not right so to do that
test I guess you can go through all the
pictures in the testing set apply the
candidate concept to see whether it says
true or false and then compare that to
what the testing set actually says the
answer is right and that will give you
an error so by the way the true target
cons of the true target concept is
whether you smile or not oh that does
make somebody creditworthy it does in my
world at least I wish it did in my world
okay so by the way an important point is
that the training set and the testing
set should not be the same if you learn
from your training set and I test you
only on your training set then that's
considered cheating in the machine
learning world because then you haven't
really shown the ability to generalize
so typically we want the training set to
include lots of examples that you don't
ask the testing set I'm sorry to include
lots of examples that you don't see in
your training set and that is proof that
you're able to generalize I see so that
and that makes intuitive sense right so
like if you're a teacher and you're
telling me that you give me a bunch of
fact and then you test me exactly that
bunch of fact it doesn't I don't have to
have understood them I just can
regurgitate them back if you really want
to see if I got the right concept you
have to see whether or not I can apply
that concept in new examples yes which
is exactly why our final exams are
written the way that they're written
because you can argue that I've learned
something by doing memorization but the
truth is you haven't you just memorized
here you have to do generalization and
remember from our last discussion
generalization is the whole point of
machine learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
