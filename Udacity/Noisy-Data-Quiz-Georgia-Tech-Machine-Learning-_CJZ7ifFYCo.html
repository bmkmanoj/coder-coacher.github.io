okay sure so in the last example we had
noise free data so I want to think a
little bit about what happens if we have
some noisy data and I'm going to come up
with a really weird noisy model but
hopefully it'll astray --tz-- the point
okay
sure okay so I've got a bunch of
training data X ID sub I and here's how
the true underlying process sort of
works so given some particular X of I
you get a label D sub I which is equal
to K times X of I where K is some number
so I'm one of the counting numbers 1 2 3
4 5 6 7 8 and so on and so forth and the
probability that you actually get any
one of those multiples of X of I is
equal to 1 over 2 to the K now why did I
choose 1 over 2 to the K because it
turns out that the sum of all those 2 to
the K is from 1 to infinity happens to
equal to 1 so it's a true probability
distribution okay
so there's just a neat little geometric
distribution so you understand the set
up so far I think so so before
hypotheses were producing answers then
we looked for them to be exactly in the
data now we're saying the hypothesis
produces an answer and it gets kind of
smooshed around a little bit before it
appears in the table that's the noisy
part right so you you're not going to be
in a case now that if a hypothesis
disagrees with the label that it sees
that in fact that means no it can't
possibly be the right hypothesis because
there's some stochastic process going on
that might corrupt your output label if
you want to think of it as corruption
since it's noisy okay okay yeah okay so
here's a set of data that you've got
here's a bunch of X's that that make up
our training data 1/3 11 12 and 20 for
some reason they're in ascending order
and the labels that go along with them
are 5 6 11 36 and 100 so you notice that
they're all multiples of some sort of
the input X okay all right now I have a
candidate hypothesis H of X which just
returns X that's kind of neat so it's
the identity function so what I want you
to do is to compute the probability
of seeing this particular dataset in a
world where that hypothesis the identity
function is in fact true the identity
function plus this noise process yes and
just one other question quickly this
this noise process is supplied
independently to each of these inputs oh
yes absolutely okay then yeah I think I
think I can do that huh
okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
