question so far I just be passionate
understand what it is you want and why
you're doing this thing because if you
don't if you're chasing something or
following someone else's advice you're
living what they want not what you want
and the best way to succeed that I found
is to follow that thing that is
important to you and knowing what's
important to you is actually a big
challenge a lot of people don't know
there's a few other things I can add to
this so one is like my dream was always
to come to California and work for one
of the largest most influential
companies in the area I've had this
dream since I read micro surfs when I
was like 12 and you know it took 20 odd
years before that actually happened but
it did happen but through the process of
just always focusing on that's my goal
on everything that I'm going to do is
somehow going to get me there all the
businesses that I started although
business partners and relationships I
built in communities that I was involved
in through all the businesses that Iran
I was always looking to come
specifically here on the flip side of
that something i would advise all
entrepreneurs to be aware of especially
in the startup scene is that startups
are seen as a product now they are a
commodity in and of themselves there's
an entire industry that is built up
around selling things to startups and
selling the concept of startups don't
believe the hype do not waste your time
going to stupid conferences for silly
awards that mean nothing to your
business always focus on your core
values and what your business means to
you and why it's valuable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
