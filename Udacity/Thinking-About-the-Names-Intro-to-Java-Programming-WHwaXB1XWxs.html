more detail the first question I asked
myself was which nouns in this problem
description are doing things well the
manager is getting assignments and
marking them with priorities and
assigning them to photographers
photographers are getting the
assignments from the manager and
completing them assignments don't seem
to do too much but we need to keep some
information associated with the
assignments in particular I thought an
assignment would have a priority and
maybe whether it's finished or not they
would also have the original description
perhaps I would even want to store the
finished work in the assignment so maybe
the finished method would take in an
assignment you might also want customer
objects maybe the customers are doing
something interesting when they create
the assignments or maybe the manager
keeps a list of customers and assigns
the priorities based on who the customer
is maybe you would want an object to
represent a priority if you imagine the
priorities as just numbers and higher
numbers mean higher priorities then you
probably wouldn't need a special
priority class but if you wanted
priorities to age overtime and increase
the longer you have the assignment then
you might want to class for priorities
because they would have behavior this
kind of design work can be very
difficult because there are so many ways
you might start but it also becomes a
lot of fun as you get better at it this
process becomes a kind of storytelling
you're using the code to document the
relationships between all of the actors
in the story and creating a model for
how to solve the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
