JavaScript environments and scope along
with a little bit of info on native
North American peoples as the text of
the problem suggests we're gonna solve
it by working out the nested environment
diagrams so let's start with the global
environment in the global environment we
define a function Apache and the first
thing we do is call it with the inputs
nine and ten so this is going to create
a new environment for that function call
of Apache the inputs were nine which
corresponds to Iroquois the second was
10 which corresponds to Ottawa we then
set Seneca to 1 and we declare inset
Creek to 2 when we print out Seneca
we're going to look at the lowest
environment which is Apache we see
Senecas 1 Iroquois is 9 Ottawa is 10 we
now declare a function cherokee and we
call it with the inputs 777 and 888
since we're going into a new function we
create a new environment 777 gets
assigned to seneca which is a local
variable and creek gets a value of 888
we print out Seneca which at the closest
scope is 777 we then it print out
Iroquois it's not in the scope of
Cherokee so we go up to Apache and
Iroquois defined as 9 we now print out
Ottawa Ottawa is not defined here in
Cherokee but this defines an Apache as
10 and lastly we're going to print out
Creek same deal not to find in shark ory
but is in Apache now we do some
modifications we set Seneca to 33 we set
Creek to 44 we said Iroquois to 55 and
it's not in Cherokee so we're changing
the value of Iroquois in the Apache
environment then we set Ottawa we leave
this function and now we're printing out
Seneca since we've left the Cherokee
function this environment no longer
applies and we're simply looking at
what's in Apache the value of Seneca is
one the power of Iroquois is 55 value of
Ottawa is 66 the value of Creek is 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
