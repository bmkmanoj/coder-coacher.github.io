optional let's try to use Z in an
operation let's take a look at this
error here the compiler is telling us
that Z needs to be unwrapped you can't
use a present that's still wrapped now
to unwrap Z we could just follow the
suggestion from the compiler and place
an exclamation mark after Z like this
but when unwrapping optionals we want to
be as careful as possible
so we're going to learn the safest way
to unwrap a variable here we can see
that this 1 2 3 string will convert to
an INT with no problem but what if we
weren't so sure here is a scenario in
which he might actually evaluate to nil
i've created an array with 2 items and
an index that is randomly either 0 or 1
when i get this string from the array i
can't be sure whether it can be
converted to an int value I don't know
whether Z will be nil or not how do we
unwrap Z safely so that we can use it in
further operations swift uses the if let
construction to carefully unwrapped
optionals
take the time to really study this
expression it'll come up frequently in
your swift projects this is the
expression that unwrapped Z and places
the int into a plain old int variable in
this case we named it int value but
there's not a strict naming convention
this unwrapping and initializing event
value is also a boolean expression
controlling this if it serves two
purposes and it will only evaluate to
true if the optional has an int value if
the optional store is nil then the whole
expression will evaluate to false inside
the block the variable int value has
been initialized as an int and can
safely be used and we can use an else
block for the nil case to see both cases
you can rerun the playground just go up
to the editors menu and click execute
playground you can see the results over
here in the side bar just click on this
little eyeball and I'll run it again and
again
sometimes I get a value and sometimes I
don't
in this example I chose variable names
to make the code easier to read but a
convention adopted by many developers is
to name the unwrapped variable to match
the wrapped variable like this this can
be a little confusing at first but
you'll get used to it after you see it a
few times you don't have to adopt this
convention but you may find that it
saves time this way you don't have to
come up with a new name for every
unwrapped variable safely unwrapping
optionals like this is a fundamental
Swift skill and one can't have too much
practice let's walk through another
example with uiimageview
here I've created a uiimageview which
has a UI image property this UI image
property is a UI image optional in this
example we'd like to access the size
property of this UI image optional if I
try to access the image property
directly to get the size the compiler
complains since there's no guarantee
that this image property contains a
value we'll need to unwrap it carefully
so we use if let to declare a variable
and initialize it with the unwrapped
image property if the image has a value
we can access its size if the image is
nil
we're still covered let's say we hadn't
set the image yet in that case the else
block gets executed and here we can see
the image hasn't been set and if we do
go ahead and set the image to something
here we can see its size and now that
it's unwrapped we can also expand the
image from within playground</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
