services generally follows this pattern
first you'll create a Google API client
and on that client you'll specify the
services that you want to use the
desired API and in this case it's
location services now the activity that
hosts this client will need to be
extended for the appropriate callbacks
and listeners the first of these is
Google API client connection callbacks
these allow you to code against events
in the API client itself such as
connecting or disconnecting from the
services the next is the Google API
client on connection failed listener
this can alert you when the connection
drops so that you can handle failures to
connect to Google's API so gracefully
specifically for location services
you'll also need the location listener
and as its name suggests it listens to
location updates so that you can respond
to them in your application you then
connect your client and wait for the
unconnected callback now for this app
you're going to have code that makes a
request for your current location you
put that in the unconnected callback and
this sets up another callback called on
location changed and when the unlock a
shin change called backfires it will
contain your location information so
that you can capture details such as the
latitude and update your UI accordingly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
