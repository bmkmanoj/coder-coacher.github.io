also known as what not to do when you're
chased by a bear so recall the question
we ended the last unit with which is
what was up with these magic methods and
we saw two of them and knit and stir
when they're missing when we didn't
define them in the class it seemed like
they were still there that would make
them pretty magical they're not really
that magical so let me show you what's
going on so let me show you that they're
actually there so I'm going to define a
totally empty class no attributes no
definitions at all and i'm going to
create an instance of that class and we
saw that that instance has n str
attribute and it's a method and we can
invoke that STR method and we get to
strength not a very interesting one but
we do get a string back and we can see
using der which is an operation that
takes any object and give us the list of
attributes defined for that object that
there's actually a whole bunch of
attributes defined for this empty class
already and we see that these include
the stir attribute which turns it into a
string as well as the knit attribute
which initializes it what's going on
here is what we call inheritance which
is the way to reuse definitions from
other classes when we define new classes
will get to inheritance soon as well as
the mystery of where these extra magic
methods came from before getting to
inherent so I want to cover three other
aspects of Python that you may not have
seen before and we haven't get covered
in this class that's format strings
named arguments and default parameters
if you already feel comfortable with
those things feel free to skip ahead to
where I start talking about inheritance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
