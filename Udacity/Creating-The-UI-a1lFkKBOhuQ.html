application we had three buttons across
the top of the screen and we had the map
fragment itself underneath them
now the basic UI that Android studio
created for us had a single textview so
delete that and replace it with the
layout code that's in the instructor
notes this is made up of a linear layout
which is set to be in vertical
orientation and within this linear
layout and then have another linear
layout at the top which contains the
three buttons and as you can see my
three buttons are button map button
satellite and button hybrid and then
underneath this linear layout for the
buttons is the fragment itself
containing the map fragment similar to
what we've been doing earlier on so if a
linear layout putting the buttons on top
and the map underneath and then the
second linear layout within the first
has the buttons horizontally stacked
side-by-side as you can see here so now
if I run the application you'll see I
have the basic map with three buttons
they won't do anything yet because I
haven't written the code behind them try
it out yourself see what happens and
check your error log for details
typically if you have problems it's the
API key hasn't been set up properly and
after we wire of the buttons we'll take
a look at how to do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
