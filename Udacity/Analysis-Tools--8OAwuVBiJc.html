you can find those this Oh wast org
website so remember we're talking about
source code analysis tools here so we
are making an assumption that code that
you write you have the source code and
you want to make sure that it doesn't
have those vulnerabilities so you're
going to run it so you obviously have
the source code you run it through these
tools a lot of times if the code is not
written by you is coming from somebody
else you may only have the binary and
then you know some of those tools that
require source code or do source code
analysis obviously won't be helpful so
discovering those vulnerabilities and by
enrages reverse engineering and all the
other skills come in but attackers for
example would take a binary code and try
to discover vulnerabilities in it and we
do that one of the lab courses we teach
here people put that hackers mindset
given a piece of binary how do you find
out if it has let's say some potential
overflow kind of a vulnerability or not
but if you have source code you writing
the code and you want to do the wave and
secure coding and so on if you work for
a company part of their software
development process may include reviews
and passing those code through these
kind of tools and so on it's a problem
that we all recognize we all recognize
the importance of writing secure code
and these analysis tools can help you
identify potential vulnerabilities
mistakes that you may have made that
could result in to these kind of things
that we've been talking about so
spending a little time with these is a
good idea and that's going to help you
write more secure code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
