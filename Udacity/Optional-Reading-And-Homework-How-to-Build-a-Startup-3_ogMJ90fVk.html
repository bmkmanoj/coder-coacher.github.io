lectures of course you can just hit the
play button but actually would be
helpful if you actually do some reading
and as I said earlier there's optional
reading and you'll see this going
forward after each lecture in the
startup owners manual pages 1 through 50
or in the strategy volume if it's an
e-book and in business model generation
pages 14 to 49 completely optional but
what's available for free is if you want
to get a feel of the core strategy how
we're trying to teach this and how we
teach this in real life
you could go to Steve Blank comm
category slash lean launchpad or just
click on the link you could also look at
other students presentations and we have
our students make two-minute QuickTime
videos which are summaries of their
presentations as well and you can see
those that Steve Blank comm slash slides
but if you want to actively engage in
the class your first real homework is
download that Osterwalder canvas and
using yellow stickies take a shot at
actually filling out all your hypotheses
on the business model canvas it's ok if
you're just guessing because the whole
class is about how do you turn those
guesses into facts so get ready download
the canvas put on those yellow stickies
and then looking at those boxes start
figuring out who would you call on and
who would you contact to start testing
those hypotheses and take a look for the
first week at your value proposition and
customer segment box who would you want
to talk to to validate whether your idea
about what features are important and
who would you talk to to validate that
these are the customers you want to go
after and we're just getting you ready
for the work you're going to do after
the next lecture see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
