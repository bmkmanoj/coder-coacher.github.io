the equations but I thought it would be
helpful to actually implement it and
kind of mess around a little bit so do
you want to see what happens I would
love to see what happen tomorrow
so I generated some data here which
comes actually from two different
Gaussian clusters one that's centered
over here ish and one that's centered
over here is just not to be too specific
about it but you can sort of see that
there's two clouds of points right one
in the upper left and one of the lower
right you can see it the one in the
lower right looks like a clown I think
it's a little bit more of a superhero
but that's not the point the point is
that it's just a bunch of random points
that's the point it's a random point but
it is a point so your point is that the
points are randomly pointed yeah I just
want to point that out it ran I see your
point and so what I want to do now is
run eeehm the first thing I need to do
is pick the initial centers right so I
need to pick the Meuse that we think
these were generated by and so a common
thing for people to do is just to take
two of the points from the data set at
random so I took two points at random
and I'll mark them with an X and now
what I'm going to do is run an iteration
of VM and what that means is I'm going
to first do expectation which is going
to assign every one of these points to
one of these two clusters and I'll color
them as to which cluster they belong to
and then I will move the center's
re-estimate the means based on that soft
assignment make sense all right now so
what you can see is something kind of
interesting happened because these
centers started off in the same cluster
together many of them were assigned to
one cluster which was the one that was a
little bit more above and then very few
of them ended up getting assigned to the
lower cluster because very few points
were essentially closer to that one than
the other one I colored the lower ones
red and the upper ones blue and there's
this sort of band of ones in the middle
that had intermediate probabilities they
weren't really very deeply one cluster
or the other they were near 0.5 yeah
exactly specifically between including
0.42 including point 6 oh okay that make
sense all right and so those are the
green ones and then based on the cluster
assignments re estimated the means so
this X now is you know the mean of the
red points and the green points because
these are actually shared and this X is
kind of the rest and you can see it
doesn't really capture yet what the true
clustering is because a huge number of
the
right cluster points are blue they're
kind of grouped in with the upper left
cluster but we can run another iteration
of VM and now things have shifted right
so now it looks like this lower right
cluster has claimed a good amount of the
points in the lower right and the blue
ones of the blue ones there's just a few
little green scattered between them at
the boundary and you'll always expect
some of that to happen now the center's
have moved and now they're starting to
take on their clusters but we can just
run this a couple more iterations until
we see the X is not really moving
anymore all right it seems to have
settled out and you can see it really
did pull out the lower right cluster as
a cluster the upper left cluster as a
cluster and just a few points at the
boundary where it said well I can sort
of believe that that's part of the red
cluster I could sort of believe it's
also part of the blue cluster I really
can't decide and you know what that's
probably right - I mean if they could go
either way yeah exactly I can sort of
hallucinate this green point here as
being part of the upper cluster just
kind of on the fringe but you know it
works just as well as being part of the
lower cluster actually my comb kind of
curious can you use your magical
computer powers to you know click on one
of those green points and see what the
probability is I could yeah so for this
one in particular it's 55 percent in the
first cluster and 45 percent in the
other cluster so it really is it's
hovering near that boundary it makes it
what about that red point all the way to
the right the ones involved by itself
excellent choice so it is actually 0.99
nine nine nine nine six in one cluster
and one minus that in the other cluster
this one is pretty certain coming from
the second cluster let's see two things
that came out of this one is e/m is much
nicer in that it's not forced to make a
decision about where those green points
go and that's good so that's sort of
soft clustering does that and that's a
good thing because then I had that
problem that we had before but one of
the consequences of that and this is not
a bad thing but it's a thing is that
even points that pretty clearly belong
to one cluster another given that we're
staring at them they do have a really
high probability 0.9999 996 but they all
have some nonzero probability of ending
up belonging to the other cluster and is
that do you think that's a good thing or
a bad thing I think it's a good thing I
think it makes sense because gaussians
have infinite extent and even if a point
is very very far away from the center it
has some chance of having
generated by that gouget and so this
just tells us what that chance is it is
very very unlikely but it is still has
nonzero probability mass in some sense
it's acknowledging truth right which is
that you can't be sure which of the two
clusters this came from even if I tell
you where those clusters are yeah okay I
agree with that okay this is cool so M
is nice so to even work for anything
other than calcium's it does it actually
can be applied in lots of different
settings let's flip over and talk a
little bit about some properties V M
