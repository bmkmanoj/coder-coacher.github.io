method does to this equation x after the
first step will be the initial value of
x plus the time step times the rate of
change at the initial time plus the rate
of change at time zero what's the rate
of change at time zero it's minus K X of
zero we can factor out X of zero and end
up with this expression that's the
result after the first time step the
initial value gets multiplied by 1 minus
step size times the constant that
appears in the test equation now let's
do the second step it's X at the end of
the previous step plus h times the rate
of change at that time or actually our
estimate of that weight of change at
that time which would be minus K X of H
again we can factor out and we can plug
in the value of x of H from the first
step so we end up with 1 minus HK times
now comes X of H 1 minus H K times X of
0 which is if we combine these two 1
minus H K squared X of 0 and you see how
this is going to proceed if we go to a 3
H this will become 4 H power 4 and so on
the question was whether or not X is
going to approach 0 this boats down to
whether or not 1 minus HK to the nth
power approaches 0 as n tends to
infinity so what happens to the enth
power of 1 minus H K we are interested
in how large h the step size can be if
the step size H gets large the
expression inside the parentheses
becomes negative you're subtracting from
one if you're subtracting more than 1
the inner term here gets negative so the
question is what happens to powers of
negative numbers to some huge power as
an example what happens if the inner
expression equals -2 and we take the
first second third fourth and so on
power minus 2 to the first power is
minus 2 minus 2 to the second power
squared is 4 the third power cubed is
minus 8
fourth power is 16 and so on which means
that this expression the nth power would
explode this is precisely not what we
want for a stable solution so let's try
a different number so what would happen
if the inner expression was minus 0.9
and he took powers of minus 0.9 the
first power is surprise minus 0.9 the
second power is 0.8 1 the third power is
minus 0.7 something the fourth power is
0.6 something each time we're losing 10%
in magnitude but you see that the sign
keeps changing minus plus minus plus so
this indeed decays to zero but in a
strange fashion it oscillates you may
remember this behavior from the sei our
model that we simulated before if this
expression would equal minus 0.99 we
would still see decay with a sort of
oscillation if it would equal minus 0.99
this would still work but become very
very slow so the threshold would be that
1 minus HK this inner expression equals
minus 1 the threshold it's 2 over K so
the condition is that H is smaller than
2 over K for this power to decay to zero
and for the forward Euler method to be
stable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
