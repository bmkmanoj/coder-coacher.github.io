distribute the parentheses on the
outside to the exponents on the inside
of the parentheses we can also do this
with fractions if we think all the way
back to unit one we saw 13 x 13 times
one-third we knew that result was 127th
we found this answer by multiplying
one-third by itself three times there
was actually another way we could have
thought about this I know the exponent
on this base one is a 1 and the exponent
on this base of 3 is also a 1 we can
distribute this exponent of 3 or
multiply it to each of the exponents on
the inside of the parentheses so a base
of one and an exponent of 1 times 3 and
a base of 3 with an exponent of 1 times
3 this is really one cubed and this is
really 3 cubed or 1/27 if we can get to
this step more quickly than we can get
to our answer 1 cubed is 1 and 3 cubed
is 27 here we have a negative sign and
we're going to square it so we know our
answer should be positive so I'm going
to have negative 5 squared and x squared
so altogether we have 25 divided by x
squared this last case of variables
works just like this first example we'll
have a to the fifth divided by B to the
fifth we just multiply the exponents on
the inside of the parentheses by the
exponent on the outside we raised a
power to a power</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
