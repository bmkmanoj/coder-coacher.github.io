still a half but I guess we really
should take into consideration those
probabilities so the number of
mismatches they have but the actual
number of errors the expected number of
errors is like well a 20th plus a 20th
so like a tenth so it's 90% correct 10%
error right that's exactly right so
what's important to see here is that
even though you may get many examples
wrong in some sense some examples are
more important than others
because some are very rare and if you
think of error or the sort of mistakes
that you're making not as the number of
distinct mistakes that you can make but
rather the amount of time you will be
wrong or the amount of time you will
make a mistake and you can begin to see
that it's important to think about the
underlying distribution of examples that
you see you buy that yep okay so that
notion of error turns out to be very
important for boosting because in the
end boosting is going to use this trick
of distributions in order to define what
hardest is since we're gonna have
learning algorithms that do a pretty
good job of learning on a bunch of
examples we're going to pass along to
them a distribution over the examples
which is another way of saying which
examples are important to learn verses
which examples are not as important to
learn and that's where the hardest
notion is going to come in so every time
we see a bunch of examples we're gonna
try to make the harder ones more
important to get right
than the ones that we already know how
to solve and now I'll describe in a
minute exactly how that's done but isn't
it the case that this distribution
doesn't really matter you should just
get them all right sure but now it's a
question of how you're gonna get them
all right which brings me to my second
definition I want to make and that
second definition is a weak learner so
there's this idea of a learning
algorithm which is what we mean by a
learner here as being weak and that
definition is actually fairly
straightforward
I'm social a stored in fact that you can
sort of forget that it's really
important and all a weak learner is is a
learner that no matter what the
distribution is over your data will do
better than chance when it tries to
learn labels on that data so what does
does better than chance actually mean
well what it means is that no matter
what the distribution over the data is
you're always gonna have an error rate
that's less than 1/2
so what that means sort of as a
formalism is written down here below
that for all D that is to say no matter
what the distribution is your learning
algorithm will have an expected error
that is the probability that it will
disagree with the true actual concept if
you draw a single sample that's less
than or equal to one half minus Epsilon
now epsilon is a term that you end up
seeing a lot in mathematical proofs and
particularly ones involving machine
learning and epsilon just means a really
really small number somewhere between a
little bigger than zero and certainly
much smaller than one so here what this
means technically is that you're bounded
away from one half which another way of
thinking about that is you always get
some information from the learner the
learner is always able to learn
something chance would be the case where
your probability is one half and you
actually learn nothing at all which kind
of ties us back into the notion of
information gain way back when with
decision trees so that all makes sense
Michael I'm not sure that I get this
right let's maybe we can do a quiz and
just kind of nail down some of the
questions that I've gotten ok sure oh
you got an idea for a quiz sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
