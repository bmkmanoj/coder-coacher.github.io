here and let's refresh the page so that
we know that we're starting from scratch
and now let's set up that object again
we need a break point here so that
Chrome will pause when we try to call on
from the console great now we can call
on to get the ball rolling there will be
several function calls in quick
succession the important thing to notice
is that new information is being passed
along with each call first internal on
is called and adds this object internal
on adds an events property to the object
which is the result of the call to
events API events API is called and
passes the on API function the existing
events if there are any or an empty
object the event name the callback and
some other contextual data let's step
into events API events API checks if the
event name is an object a string of
multiple space separated events or a
single name our event is log so we end
up down here the empty list of events
name and call back our past two on API
when we started by calling on down here
in the console everything up to this
point has been verifying information and
adding new things that are getting
passed along we finally reach the bottom
of the stack pay attention to what's
going on in this function since this is
our first time through events name
doesn't exist yet so an empty array is
created both events name and handlers
points to this same array we didn't pass
any options so these are just undefined
handlers is the new array that was just
created and an object containing the
callback function is added to it if we
look at the current scope will see that
there's an events object with a log
property that's an array of one object
that object has the call back inside it
the rest of the process is returning
this event object lastly and most
importantly remember that this events
object is stored as a property on the
original object and that's it so back
bones on method adds an events object to
the object each key is the name of an
event to listen for and each value is a
list of callbacks to run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
