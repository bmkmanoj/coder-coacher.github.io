gives you direct access to the most
prominent UI element on the user's most
personal device the API is simple enough
to build watch faces quickly and
flexible enough to allow personalization
given the depth and flexibility of the
Android platform you can create
something for the user that's both
beautiful and packed with unique
features now here's a few design
guidelines that will set the right
context for making these design
decisions first android wear comes in
multiple form factors so you want to
make sure the watch faces work great on
both round and square watches next there
are two primary States for Android wear
interactive mode is in full color and
motion with fluid animation this is
typically when the user is giving
focused attention to their watch ambient
mode is a low-power state and it should
use a limited color palette that's only
updated once a minute and finally make
sure to take special screens into
account on low bit screens pixels in
ambient mode are either off or on which
means you only want to use black and
white with no anti-aliasing you're also
going to want to use burnin protection
techniques with OLED screens like
avoiding large blocks of opaque pixels
in fact we recommend that around ninety
five percent of the screen in ambient
mode remain black once you've finalized
your design the best way to start
developing is either to start with a
sample or a template in Android studio
there are three main methods which are
going to want to know about first the
oncreate method you'll take care of your
initialization tasks such as loading
resources or initializing paint objects
for later use in this method you can
scale these objects using the on surface
changed method this method has the
screen size passed in as one of its
parameters if you have a bitmap
background or watch hands this is a
great place to scale them to the right
size at the core of the watch face API
is the ondraw method that allows you to
draw whatever design you can think of to
the canvas at a high enough frame rate
to deliver fluid animation now this is
going to come through it full fidelity
while the watch is in interactive mode
and at other times when the watch is in
ambient mode you're able to draw more
discrete version of the watch while also
saving power
additional preferences can be set to
arrange the system UI elements
appropriately for your design once those
basics are covered the limits are your
imagination you can go further with
additions like I don't know a moon phase
the current weather or even fitness
stats or watchmakers call these items
complications but with Android wear
they're hardly complicated once you have
the data just draw it on the canvas as
you did the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
