tell the participants that it was a
study on obedience to Authority instead
he told them it was a study of memory
and here you can see the original
advertisement that Milgram used when the
participant arrived there were always
two other people present one was Milgram
who was the experimenter and then there
was another person in Milgram had these
two people draw slips to determine
whether they were going to be a teacher
or they were going to be a learner
unbeknownst to the participant the
person who was with Milgram was actually
Confederate meaning that person was
working for Milgram therefore when they
chose slips Milgram had arranged it that
the real participant was always the
teacher and the learner was a
Confederate or a person who was working
with Milgram now remember the
participant thought this was a study on
memory so Milgram told the participant
that he was going to read a series of
words and that the other participant the
learner who was a Confederate would have
to remember those words every time the
learner would get a word incorrect the
teacher was to deliver a shock the
learner was to memorize those word lists
and provide correct answers and during
the study Milgram who was the
experimenter observed the teacher and
provided instruction so here the teacher
thought that he was to read words and
deliver shocks but in fact Milgram was
testing that participants level of
obedience as well as his willingness to
inflict pain to the learner now remember
the learner was a Confederate working
for Milgram and he did not receive any
actual shocks and he actually didn't
even respond to the word lists all the
responses were pre-programmed and
finally Milgram served as the authority
figure in this study and he was
positioned next to the teacher while the
teacher was reading the words and
supposedly delivering the shocks so we
had the teacher the learner in Milgram
now let's go into a little more details
on the specific methods of the
experiment the teacher and learner were
to be tested
separate rooms but before the learner
left the teacher actually was hooked up
to the shock machine and received a very
small shock and this was to let the
teacher know that the shock generator
actually worked and also so the teacher
was aware of the type of shocks that the
learner would experience
Milgram instructed the teacher to
provide a shock for every incorrect
response and they would start at the low
end of the shock generator and with each
consecutive incorrect response the
teacher had to provide a shock and that
went up on the shock generator to 450
volts so here's the experimental
arrangement here we had the teacher who
is sitting in front of the voltage
machine and noticed that the learner is
in a separate room remember the learners
the Confederate and when the study began
he actually just left the room all of
the responses were pre-programmed notice
too that Milgram was sitting near the
teacher as he was observing that person</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
