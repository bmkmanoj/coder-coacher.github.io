large number of reasoning methods here
are some of them we could have waited a
lot more here for example pan refinement
or logic or scripts typically when you
and I program in a agent we pick a
method and we program that method into
the agent one unanswered question is how
might an agent know about all of these
methods and then autonomously select the
right method for a given problem this is
the problem of strategy selection and
metacognition helps with strategy
selection given a problem and given that
all of these methods are available to
the agent to potentially address the
problem metacognition is select between
these methods using several criteria
first each of this message requires some
knowledge of the world for example case
based reasoning requires knowledge of
cases constraint propagation requires
knowledge of constraint and so on
metacognition is select one particular
method depending on what knowledge is
exactly available for addressing that
specific input problem if for that
specific input problem cases are not
available then clearly the method a case
based reasoning cannot be used if on the
other hand constraints are available
that constraint propagation might be a
useful method second if the knowledge
required by multiple methods is
available that metacognition must select
between the competing methods under the
criteria for selecting between these
methods might be computational
efficiency for a given class of problems
some of these methods might be
computationally more efficient than
other methods as an example if the
problem is very close to a previously
encountered case then a case based
reasoning might be computationally a
very good method to use on the other
half the new problem is very different
from a previously encountered case in
case based reasoning may not be a
computationally efficient method we have
come across this issue of computational
efficiency earlier in the class for
example when we were discussing generate
and test the problem is simple then it
is potentially possible to write a
generator that will produce good
solutions to it on the other hand for
very complex problem the process of
generating good solutions may be
computationally inefficient similarly if
there is a single goal then the method
of means and Sun analysis might be a
good choice on the other hand of their
multiple goals that are interacting with
each other that means and services can
run into all kind of cul-de-sacs and
have poor computational efficiency
third criteria that metacognition can
use to select between these various
methods is quality of solutions some
method come with guarantees or quality
of solutions for example logic is a
method provides some guarantees of the
correctness of solutions thus if this is
the problem for which computational
efficiency is not important where the
quality of solutions is critical we
might want to use the method of logic
because it provides some guarantees of
the quality although it might be
computationally inefficient the same
kind of analysis holds for selecting
between different learning methods once
again given a problem the agent may have
multiple learning methods for addressing
that particular problem what message
should be learning agent choose it
depends partly on the nature of the
problem some methods are applicable to
that problem and some methods may not be
applicable to their power second for
example in this learning task if the
examples are coming one at a time we
might use incremental concept learning
on the other hand if all the examples
are given together then we might use
decision tree learning or identification
green learning another criteria for
deciding between these methods could be
computational efficiency yet under the
criteria could have to do with quality
of solutions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
