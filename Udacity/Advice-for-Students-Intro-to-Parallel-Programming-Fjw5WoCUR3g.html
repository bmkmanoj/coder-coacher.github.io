question what advice do you have for
students that are taking this course and
learning parallel programming maybe for
the first time I think parallel
programming requires you to think about
your program program in a different way
and the thing that I see most when I go
out and I spent a lot of my time talking
to people who are trying to use not just
GPUs but clustered computer systems and
multi-core systems never I just you know
I spend a lot of my job is finding out
the problems people are facing a lot of
the problems boil down to not MPI is
hard or or clusters as hard or
networking as hard it actually boils
down to parallel programming it's hard
and it's hard because a lot of them are
thinking in terms of I know how to write
a serial program I assume parallel
programming must be the same but often
you need to think about your problem in
a different way you need to think about
how do I break my problem up into
independent pieces because the way that
you get your parallel problem solved is
to have lots of independent pieces which
only come together either in small
subsets or infrequently because I'm down
low and always kill you in the end and
so you've got to find a way around that
and and if you start out thinking of
your problem in parallel terms instead
of in serial terms you can you will end
up with a much better solution to your
problem sort of analogous to how if
you're trying to think it solve a
problem in C++ maybe this doesn't
actually applied it to the simplest me
cuz I'm not sure if you're trying to say
if you're trying to solve your problem
in C++ don't start thinking about it and
see because although you can express C
and C++ your solution in C++ will be a
very different design to how you to
solve it and see same goes for parallel
serial programming so it's not this is
not just cooter advice in general this
is apparel programming advice in general
sit down and think about your problem in
terms of where can i extract the
independent work rather than how do i do
the work now how do i multiply it by 10
Steven thanks so much for coming in
today we appreciate your time it's a
pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
