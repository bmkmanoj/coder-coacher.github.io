of these graphs would be graph number
three is the strongest correlation graph
number one is the next strongest
correlation graph number four has the
next strongest correlation and the
second graph has the weakest correlation
now think about this with me for just a
second think about why this says what
we're going to do is we're going to
measure a couple of points in our graph
take a look at our strongest correlating
graph you see if we go over to any given
point we come down at about the same
place on the horizontal axis on the
x-axis the y-axis and the x axis values
are roughly the same for each point
they're pretty close together they're a
match and now notice it in our weakest
correlated graph then if we go to any
given point wow we're kind of all over
the place right and we have a relatively
high height for twin to hear but that
point goes down to a relatively low
height for twin one so that wasn't a
very high match we do the same thing
here we had a lower height for twin two
and a really high height for twin one at
that point so these are not correlating
very well and this is the graphical
representation of that if you have any
trouble you should definitely check out
the Udacity course on statistics co
taught by Katie carminic and also go to
the discussion forms for this video and
see if you can get some advice or help
from your classmates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
