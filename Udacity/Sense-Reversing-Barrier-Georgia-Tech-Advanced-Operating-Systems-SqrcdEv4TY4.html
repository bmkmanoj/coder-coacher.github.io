like this when a thread arrives at a
barrier what it is going to do is it is
decrement the count exactly like like in
the counting barrier it's going to
decrement the count but after it
decrements the count what it is going to
do is it is gonna spin on sense reversal
remember that you know the sense flag is
going to be true for this barrier and
once everybody is progressed to the next
barrier the defense flag will become
false and therefore let's say that we
are executing the the true barrier in
other words all the threads are
executing somewhere here the sense flag
is true and so if t1 comes along it
decrements the count and it's not going
to worry about whether the count has
become 0 or not all that it is gonna
wade on is for the sense to reverse so
it's it's saying well my sense is we are
on the true barrier I'll stay here until
the sense becomes false I'll know then
then that we've moved on to the next
barrier point that's the idea behind
behind what all the processors will do
except the last one one of the last one
do well you guessed it the last one in
addition to resetting the counter end
which was happening in the counting
barrier it is also going to reverse a
sense flag so last processor comes along
and finds that the count has become 0
it'll reset it to end no problem with
that and then it is going to reverse the
sense flag it used to be true here it
already set it to false and all the
other guys are waiting on the sense
reversal so decrementing the count
itself when changing the count value
that doesn't do anything to these
threads only when the sense flag is
reversed all these guys come out of the
spin loop and they can go on so you can
see now that we have only one spinning
episode per critical section or one
spinning episode per barrier what we're
doing is we decrement the count and spin
nonsense reversal last guy decrements
the count when count goes to zero resets
it to N and then it is going to reverse
a sentence and that is the signal for
all the waiting processes to say well we
can now go on to the next phase of the
computation so we've gotten rid of one
of the spinning episodes that used to be
there in the
pure counting version of the centralized
barrier well the centralized barrier is
simple and intuitive as to what's going
on and of course with the sense
reversing barrier we got rid of two
spinning episodes and got it down to two
one all of these are good things but the
problem is that you have a sink shared
variable for all the processes and so if
you have a large-scale multiprocessor
and if you're running a large-scale
scientific applications with lots of
parallel threads and they have to do a
barrier causes a lot of contention on
the interconnection network because it
was hot spot for this shared variable
and remember what our good friend that
Chuck Thacker said that sharing means
the multiprocessor is more scalable and
that is something that we want to carry
forward in thinking about how to get rid
of this sharing that's happening among a
large number of processors in order to
build a more scalable version of a
barrier synchronization algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
