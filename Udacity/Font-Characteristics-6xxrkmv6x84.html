of fonts a bit think of this as a crash
course on the anatomy of type a super
fast primer on basic typography as we
mentioned earlier Roboto is the standard
font included in Android it is a sans
serif font sans serif means without
seraphs serifs are the little wings
attached to the strokes of a letter like
these here that hang off the letter r
serif fonts are common in printed works
like books and are generally considered
more comfortable for long-form reading
on the other hand sans serif fonts are
more common on the web and can be well
suited to short bursts of text like in
user interfaces they're also generally a
safer choice when you're dealing with a
range of screen densities a serif font
can be a great complement to Roboto if
used sparingly for things like title
headings and large type now due to
issues like anti-aliasing which would
make small serifs appear kind of blurry
it wouldn't be advisable to use a serif
font for really really small text let's
also briefly talk about font metrics
we're only going to talk about the
English alphabet for now when trying to
describe the anatomy of text you can
easily go down a long long long rabbit
hole anyway
let's first start with the base line the
base line is essentially the optical
bottom point of all text that doesn't
extend below like the lowercase Y here
next is the x height which refers to the
height of the lowercase X in the font
basically the height of most lowercase
letters like the letter e here fonts
with a relatively large x height tend to
be more legible and better suited for
body text after that is the cap height
which is the height of most uppercase
letters like the capital T here and next
you have ascenders and their cousin
descenders these are parts of the
lowercase letters that extend way above
the cap height or below the base line so
the H has an ascender here and the Y has
a descender and finally you have the
letting that's the spacing between
vertical lines of text on Android you
can control the letting but provide
line spacing multiplier or line spacing
extra for a textview now there's a lot
more to font Anatomy than just this like
I said we just talked about the English
alphabet check the instructors notes for
links where you can learn more about
font anatomy and other cool font
typography type stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
