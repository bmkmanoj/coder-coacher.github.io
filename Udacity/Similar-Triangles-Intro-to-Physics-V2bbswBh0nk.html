trigonometry now if you've already
mastered trig you don't have to watch
this next part
but you may be entertained and if you
haven't mastered trig well you're in for
a treat because this is one of the
branches of mathematics that we use all
the time in physics and it's really
fascinating so let's start by looking at
a right triangle isn't that nice with
it's right angle marked by a square and
it's three sides okay so what can we
learn from this triangle well let's
first make a copy of it here is a copy
identical in every way same angles and
same sides we call that congruent and
that just means we have the same sides
in the same angles if this has a length
of seven this has a length of seven this
has length of 12 this is a length of 12
and likewise for the angles what if this
triangle were a little bigger what if I
were to expand it proportionally so as
it grows it grows the same way in each
direction same amount in each direction
well clearly this is not identical to
this triangle these two are not
congruent but they are similar in some
way so let's come up with a name to
describe two triangles that are similar
in such a way in fact let's call them
similar these are similar triangles and
they're so vital to doing physics now
each of these triangles has three angles
this one I've labeled one two and three
this one four five and six do they have
anything in common
are they equal is this statement true
the angle one equals four angle two
equals five and go three equals angle
six check whichever of these statements
are true about these two triangles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
