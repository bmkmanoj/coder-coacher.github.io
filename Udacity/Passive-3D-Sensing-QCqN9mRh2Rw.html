sensing some of which we've already seen
so passive 3d sensing what do we mean by
that that means you don't use any active
illumination that is you take the world
as it's given to you and you somehow
sense that and maybe you exploit some
known geometry of the properties or
something about the scene so have we
actually done something that recovers
geometry of the scene well of course we
have right we've done stereo in fact
those of you who are participating in
the class for credit have actually
matched stereo images so here's an
example of some stereo rigs these are
sort of amateur ones you know I love
this one right build the wooden block
screw two cameras on capture picture
here's something a little more
sophisticated where you've got some
high-end video cameras mounted on a
rigid bar that you can control the
Virgin's angle but of course if any of
you gone to the movies lately you've
probably paid a lot of extra money in
order to be able to entertain your two
eyes separately or more precisely to see
movies in 3d stereo and here's the types
of rigs that they use somebody to notice
that's a Spielberg on the right in the
middle i think that's james cameron and
he was behind the making of avatar
avatar was one of the first movies where
3d was fundamental to sort of the
experience of the movie and there had
been a lot of 3d movies before it's
obviously one sense but in this non film
critics view of the universe it was a
seamless blending of sort of what you
think of his normal imagery but done in
3d along with computer graphics and so
the 3d experience wasn't despite wasn't
just sort of the experience of 3d it was
actually crafted as part of the movie
least this is my part of view of the
universe and it's when it really made it
and the technology come around quite a
bit with polarized light to really be
able to give you a compelling 3d
experience there are other ways also of
getting depth from natural image one
cool one we actually talked a little bit
about this when we were talking about a
focus pull right is that the way a lens
works focal plane is actually in focus
and then some other and the when things
that are further away or in front are
not in focus so you can go from focus to
depth all right in fact here's this cute
animation of this scene right where you
can see that their varying the focal
plane and by varying the focal plane you
can figure out the depth of different
parts of the scene alright so that's all
passive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
