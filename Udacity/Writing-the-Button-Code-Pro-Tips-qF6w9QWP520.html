probably not going to work because I
haven't set up the API key the next
thing that you should do is to go to the
Google console and then based on the
name of the app like in this clay case
you can see my app is at calm google dev
plan that al Moroni got maps at three
underscore two I need to set that up
within the API console so if you
remember in the earlier lesson when we
created public API access
we had an API key and we had Android
applications that were allowed to use
that API key and these were defined by
the sha-1 in this case the debug one
followed by a semicolon followed by the
name of the application now you can see
here I've done the same thing the same
sha-1 and now this application cam
Google dev plateau Moroney dot maps
three two this is the most common place
to go wrong in writing applications and
creating them is that either you've
named this incorrectly you've made a
mistake with the sha-1 key your API key
is wrong or something along those lines
so if you see this API key beginning
with a lza and ending with D or z8 if I
go back to Android studio and go to my
Android manifest you can see I have it
was AI CA sorry not a healthy you can
see I have the and the API key set up
here correctly and it's definitely the
same name application comm google dev
platted el muro need Maps three two a
little pro tip is if you ever refactor
it you'll think you've refactored and
you've gotten everything changed
if you refactor the name of your package
and they'll find that map's don't
actually work what can happen is that
while you refactor it and while you've
changed it on the console in refactoring
and build up Gradle the application ID
string here may not change so if you
ever refactor your app and you find
trouble just make sure to come back into
your builder cradle and make sure that
the the string here with an application
ID matches the refactoring that you've
done
so let's now run the application and
take a look and here it is again is the
application running you can see I'm
centered on New York City I have my
three buttons laid out across the top
remember that was the horizontal layout
and then the entire thing is in a
vertical layout
with the button panel on top of the
actual map fragment and of course I can
continue to pan and zoom around the map
the first so desire and like when I
press the buttons for example the hybrid
button I now get a hybrid map which
you'll see more closely if i zoom in so
you can see the street names are
highlighted in the streets themselves
were highlighted so I have the
photographic the satellite photographic
map but with the lines of roads and
things laid out on top of it which is
really really useful when you're
navigating around places or if I just
want the pre or satellite picture here
it is so as as simple as that very
little coding and you're beginning to
see that you can build some pretty
powerful functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
