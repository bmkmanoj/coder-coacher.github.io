so with a bit of playing around I think
you can get it so first you have to take
this long road over here because any
other way to travel over here is much
longer and then you still need to go
back so so with a bit of playing around
you can find out that the next house to
visit is this one here then it's almost
obvious that you should go up here now
here you could choose to take the fast
way to this house up here or the one
that takes a bit longer actually it's
better here to go down because otherwise
you'll have to visit some of these
houses multiple times then you can go
back up here then you go over here and
then it's almost obvious because you
have to drive to base anyway that this
is the last one that you visit and then
you go back to base and the total time
for this is and I calculated this for
you as a service 167 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
