tracking like we saw before but now the
particle filter tracking we've got a
model in tracking it but the thing that
we're going to do now that's a little
bit different this is sort of the cool
part is we're not going to assume that
our appearance and observation model
remain constant basically the idea is
we're going to sort of update on the
model as we get new images coming in now
a sort of a standard way of doing this
and by the way this works really poorly
so don't do it is I have a model
appearance I look around I say oh that's
my best one and I say okay I guess it's
changed a little bit let me pull out
that model and I'll find that in the
next image and eventually what happens
is you get drift and the model lands on
that there's this really really cool
thing oh you can't see okay I'm going to
pretend like there's this really great
car sitting right over here and you know
eventually and just get stuck on there
and the thing that I was tracking would
go it would go away but if I don't
update my model then as things change i
can't find it so well anymore so what we
do here instead is with every new
appearance we're going to change our
eigen basis right this is this is the
set of eigen vectors that lets us
reconstruct we're going to change that a
little bit and that allows for a small
variation appearance but it's still
going to try to do things like track the
general class and so the trick is just
as it's written here given the basis set
b of t minus 1 that we use to find the
LOB servation at time t minus 1 we that
allows us to compute a new eigenbasis b
of t that we're going to use now to
evaluate our measurements all right so
the idea is that we're updating this
eigenbasis but it's adding sort of it's
a small variation each time so we can't
radically change what things look like
we can change them a little bit and this
is referred to as an incremental
subspace update as remember from PCA we
said the whole reason that we're doing
this dimensionality reduction is the
idea that we believe our images line
some subspace but we have to find that
subspace within the big
feature space so that's why this is
referred to as an incremental subspace
update and why are we doing this
basically we're accounting for
appearance change so we might be
tracking the the object in the image
it's translating it's rotating it's
maybe sharing but if I rotate out of the
plane as far as the camera is concerned
my face is changing its appearance as I
go sideways it usually gets worse but
that's okay the idea is I want to model
that change so we're learning a new
appearance representation as as the
imagery changes in the papers that I've
been telling you about they base it upon
this recursive SVD algorithm which is
kind of nice so you don't have to do the
whole I gandi composition decomposition
again so you can do this quickly in real
time that part doesn't matter so much
essentially what you have is an
algorithm that allows you it's kind of
like a running mean algorithm where
you're using the most recent examples
more strongly than the older examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
