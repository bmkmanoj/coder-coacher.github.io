sets with the same fields and ending
them together to make a longer data set
well what if you want to blend multiple
data sets with different data for
instance pretend we want to create this
really great 360 view of our customers
so we can build a predictive model from
it will want to start with as much
information about the customers that we
can get before we can determine which
variables will want to use in the model
will take a transaction data set that's
summarized to the customer level showing
their total transactions total spend etc
then we might want to use another data
set that shows what marketing campaigns
they responded to maybe we can even pull
in a third data set with their address
data showing how far these customers are
located from their store locations to
blend these data sets together we'll
need some information in common amongst
all three of these files that
information in common is what's going to
tie each record in each data set to the
same record in the other data sets in
the example here we can see that each
data set has an ID number associated
with each record we use this field to
join the three data sets together
however we may not always have a field
like ID to join data sets together with
you need to look at the fields in your
data sets and figure out which fields
can be used to join two other data sets
for instance maybe you're joining data
sets together related to products in
that case you might be able to use some
kind of product code or skew which
stands for stock keeping unit and is
frequently represented by a machine
barcode or maybe you have to use a
combination of fields that make the
record unique for instance if you don't
have a customer ID on each record maybe
you have to join on first name last name
and address fields to identify the same
customers in each data set</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
