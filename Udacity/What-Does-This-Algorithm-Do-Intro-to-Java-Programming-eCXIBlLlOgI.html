maybe up for debate and when it works it
makes a doorway you might have felt like
my instructions were ambiguous I'm going
to pretend they were perfect though if
you can write clearer instructions post
them on the forum I'd like to read them
and now I'm going to do my best
impersonation of a robot and follow this
algorithm so first I'm going to place an
8 by 2 block horizontally I'll do it
this way so you can see what I'm doing
and I'm going to stick a 2 by 2 block on
the top of the left
end of the 8 by 2 block so right here
now 3 times I'm going to stick a 2 by 2
block on top of the previous block so
this was the previous block 1 2 3 and
now I'm going to stick a 2 by 2 block on
top of the right end of the a by 2 block
and I'll repeat 3 times putting a 2 by 2
block on top of the previous block and
now I put an 8 by 2 block on the highest
ooh and we have a doorway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
