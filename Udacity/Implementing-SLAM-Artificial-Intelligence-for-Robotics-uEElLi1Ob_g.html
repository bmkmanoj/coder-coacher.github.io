slam and that's quite a bit and it's
really simple every time there's a
constraint initial position motion or
measurement we take this constraint and
add something to Omega and see and what
we add is the constraint itself but it's
up multiplied by a strength factor
there's nothing else but 1 over Sigma
the uncertainty in motion or
measurements and then when we're done
with this adding we simply calculate
this guy and out comes our best possible
path and along with a map of other
landmarks isn't that something isn't
that really cool so let's dive in and
let have you program your own real robot
example this is a fairly complicated
generalization of what we just saw I'm
giving you environment where you can
specify the number of landmarks that
exists the number of time steps you want
the word run the world size the
measurement range that is the range at
which a robot might be able to see a
landmark of its further away than this
address won't see it a motion noise a
measurement noise and the distance
parameter the distance specifies how
fast the world moves in each step and
then I'm giving you a routine which
makes the data it takes all these
parameters in outputs a data field that
contains sequence of motions and a
sequence of measurements the code
comments on the exact format of what
data looks like now I want you to
program the function slam that inputs
the data and various important
parameters and then outputs my result a
sequence of estimated poses the word
path and estimated landmark positions
this is really challenging to program
it's based on the math that just gave
you the robot coordinates are now x and
y coordinates the measurements are
differences in x and y so you have to
duplicate things for x and things for
what for y I myself put them all into
one big matrix but you can have them in
two separate matrices if you so wish you
have to apply everything we learn so far
including the weights of one of our
measurement noise and one more of a
motion noise these happen to be
equivalent this case but they might be
different
we need to run slam and we turn back to
me a result data structure
I'm also supplying you with the print
results routine so you go in and see how
the result has to look like there's an
example routine that doesn't work that
outputs all the correct formats but it
turns not to implement the estimate that
I wanted to estimate you have to bring
this to life and turn this into an
amazing slam routine so that when you
run it you get the same results that I
do for the examples here where there's
an estimated path and estimated landmark
positions there's one last thing I want
you to know is I assume the initial
robot position it's going to be the
center of the world so it's the world
size of a hundred it's gonna be 50/50 or
here it's printed as forty nine point
nine nine nine but it's the same as 50
so you have to put in a constraint that
sets the initial robot pose to the
center of the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
