components it has a horizontal and a
vertical component and those two
components are completely independent
what do I mean by independent I mean
that we can break a two-dimensional
motion problem into two separate
one-dimensional motion problems and this
is an amazing tool what we've already
shown how in one dimension if we're for
example dropping a ball at the instant
when we drop the ball well it has no
velocity not quite yet one second later
it's picked up some velocity it picks up
that much again in the second second and
again it picks up the same amount in the
third and we can represent that
pictorially with pictures like this now
what if instead of dropping the ball we
throw it to the side what kind of arrows
are we going to draw now the instant the
ball is released it only has horizontal
velocity that's from you throwing it I
said before that these components are
completely independent so that means
after one second this horizontal
component well it doesn't change it
keeps going to the right and just like
in the one-dimensional problem before it
picks up in speed going downwards in
fact it picks up the same amount of
vertical speed that it would have had we
just dropped the ball after two seconds
horizontal component does not change but
the vertical gets twice as long and
after three seconds the vertical grows
again and the horizontal stays the same
now this is a sort of strange picture
here this ball moving to the right or is
it moving down or is it moving in some
other direction which of these arrows
best describes the direction of the
balls motion at this point in time and
it's a guest so don't worry if you're
wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
