interesting applications of asymmetric
cryptography we'll see some of those
later in unit 5 but for now I want to
focus on how to actually build an
asymmetric cryptosystem what we want to
build is what's known as a trapdoor
one-way function so one-way function
would be a function that is easy to
compute in one direction and hard to
compute in another direction with
asymmetric crypto well we need to reveal
this function we want the reverse to
still be hard but we want some way to be
able to do the reverse easily if we know
some secret so that's our trapdoor we
want to be able to if you have some
secret key you can do the inverse if you
don't you can't so that's what makes it
an asymmetric cryptosystem that it's
hard to do in the reverse direction
unless you have this extra key but
revealing the easy way to do the forward
direction does not reveal the easy way
to do the worse direction so different
Hellman envisions such a crypto system
in the 1976 paper that we talked about
last unit but they didn't devise a
function that had this property the
first crypto system to successfully have
this property is the RSA cryptosystem
and that'll be the focus for the rest of
this unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
