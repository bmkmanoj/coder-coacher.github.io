where we can certainly say by now that
they are true so we know that every
problem that is in P is also contained
in NP this is why we drew the picture
like this so that's obvious if every
problem in NP were also contained in P
that would mean that we have a
polynomial time algorithm for vertex
cover independent set and clique we do
not know that to be true it of course we
also don't know it to be false but it's
not something we can make a statement
about and since we can't make a
statement about this year we can also
not say that P and NP are equivalent or
basically the same now the fourth one is
probably the most subjective one so of
course it seems like NP should contain
more problems than P simply for the
reason that non-determinism is just so
powerful that we would not expect that
every problem that can be solved in
polynomial time using non determinism
can also be solved in polynomial time on
a deterministic Ram if you just think
about how much time our simulation took
and of course it might not be the best
possible simulation but I think it's
highly unlikely we can't be sure but
that's why I wrote here it seems like
and P should contain more problems and
not stated it as a fact so that I can
make a check mark here now finally
vertex cover independent set and clique
if we knew that they were in P we would
have a polynomial time algorithm can't
really make that statement right now
and finally vertex cover independent set
and clique yes they are an NP we showed
that they can be solved in polynomial
time if we have the wonderful and magic
if better function available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
