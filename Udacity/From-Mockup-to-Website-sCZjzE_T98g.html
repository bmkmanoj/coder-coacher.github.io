will be going hello Jordan we're going
to be going over how to go from a
mock-up to a full website full website
here being HTML and CSS so basically how
to take to start from an idea and a
design and put it into actual code so
that it can be visible to the web just
in HTML CSS obviously you could probably
also just make an image of it and put it
on a something interesting website earth
but that's not really what we're we're
looking to do here so to start with I
suppose we could go into mock-ups are
generally used because it's easier to
design a mock-up than it is to just
start coding and try to make a website
so you generally have um either a group
of people or a person whose job it is to
actually make mock-ups there that's all
that is after all more art than
technical skills and then from there you
give it to a front-end web designer and
they would start actually making it into
an actual web site and if you want to do
this yourself it's a bunch of different
tools you can use to do mock-ups you can
make them in Photoshop it's pretty
common you can make them there's a web
software called balsamic you can also
make what mock-ups there you have any
other ideas like google use to make
mock-ups um and some people actually use
literal paper yeah paper is a big one -
oh yeah but and they might actually like
cut things out and sort of make it you
might think of it as arts and crafts but
that's that's sort of like what they
actually do
yeah and then for the redesign they
actually cut out a little piece of paper
and use that as their design mock-ups so
you know everybody uses it so that's
that's what we'll be doing today we'll
be actually using the same mock-up that
you might have seen in class so just to
show that here maybe I'll screen share
so this is the this is actually what I
was doing right now this is the mock-up
that we'll be using
so Udacity symbol up top name what
they're this is basically supposed to be
a resume type of thing and unless you're
showing off some featured work with some
images the mock-up is actually just a
portion to the left of this white spur
to the right of this white space this is
just designating which colors are going
to be used these are the how the colors
look these are the actual color hex
what's the actual word for that I don't
know I'm forgetting the way the word for
the hex the hex colors is it a large X
doesn't yeah it's just a coach for the
colors right so that's what we will be
trying to do here and we'll do it more
or less from scraps so let's open up
sublime and go so the two main things
we'll be using here are sublime and the
browser since what we just open it up
and in our browser quite often so let's
screen share sublime so what we'll be
doing here hopefully everyone can see
that very blank screen yeah yeah I can
see okay so what we'll be doing here is
first we'll just make an HTML file since
that's what we'll be using with it so
I'm resizing everything making the font
a little bit bigger so first we'll save
this we'll do it in I think this was my
blank thing right here or somewhere
blank thing right here and we'll just
call it a web page because you know I'm
really really talented at coming up with
names so just web page that HTML so I
should be able to just type in
HTML and it sort of fills in the very
very basics with me for sublime because
I install that HTML
auto auto film I never seen that this
old-school you just press your citation
on press enter tab but yeah you can if
you if you want to look into how to make
sublime work for that work like that for
you then it's it's just a package
instead of like install package google
it it's not that complicated but it's
not that simple either so from there
let's just add some really basic stuff
like let's add a a character set our
title what should we call our title my
page looks a little page for mock-up and
then of course an important thing is
we're gonna have to link it some TS s so
I'll link to I'll call they'll call it
styles that HDR that CSS and that means
I also have to make some actual you know
CSS so let's open a new tab here I don't
want a new window how do I just make a
new tab you can make a new tab I just
think new file probably I might sent
okay so we'll just save this really
quick as I said I think I said Styles
dot CSS mm-hmm that's there Oh hopefully
that that looks like it works okay so
you can see both of those things now for
mock-ups it did you want to send you
wanna
you're yeah the maken percent you can
have it all hello Mr Pascoe feel free to
ask your questions oh cool
exams in question anyway I'll just keep
on going on about what we'll be doing
next in the mock up you will be dividing
well basically everything everything
will do will be sort of putting the
mock-up into boxes and those will be
ours dibs so that's that's how we're
going to divide up the page into a bunch
of different boxes that boxes inside
boxes and not an actual mock-up you
might actually draw those in you might
literally just draw boxes around what
you want to put as as your different
divs and then we'll be using basically
so that we can the mock-up the mock-up
has at most three side-by-side pictures
it's like dividing the screen into third
generally we will divide it into a grid
of twelve that grid of twelve will allow
us to actually make four cent side by
side three side by side to side by side
just one it's it's divisible by all
those things you can it's sort of the
standard for what you'd use for
something like this anyway
I'll just move on then Mac all right
yeah the screen wasn't wasn't care yeah
back in but we good enough I'll actually
copy and paste this from from the actual
something you could have downloaded from
the course it's basically just we're
going to make some CSS for every single
possible column between 1 and 12 and
every row and we're going to be doing
that by putting basically this in so
each column has a specified width and if
you increase your your text size a
little bit sure you see yeah okay sure
so hopefully this works the column width
this is just what you get when you have
a hundred divided by 12 and then you
just double it or not double it but you
increase by 8.3 every time and so we
have 1 through 12 and then we have a row
for something that takes up the entire
entirety of the screen with with just a
hundred percent here this margin bottom
I suppose I could delete for the moment
it's just specifying there's not gonna
have a margin here and that we're going
to be able to flex the screen so if you
move things in and out it'll be it'll
keep images from overlapping and from
not resizing basically or text from
doing the same so that's where we'll
start
so now let's start adding in some stuff
with their body so let's I believe we
may have to make a class grid I forgot
to do this so again opening closing tags
there I think I actually forgot that
from the CSS if it will also need the
grid
so we pulled everything together for the
max width and all that stuff so back to
the CSS okay so now that we have the
grid let's put that in right away and
then that's just what this is basically
our whole body's going to be inside that
grid so this is I'm not actually sure
how necessary that technically was
because we could have just had said for
what we have pre grid here is body if
we're gonna have the entire body inside
the grid but we better practice anyway
let's make a class for the top and keep
on forgetting autofill can get a little
annoying because sometimes it wants to
fill it north and you actually want like
let's have let's see actually first
let's let's draw some lines around the
the mock-up oh I'll stop screen sharing
and share
oh I already stopped screen-sharing
sorry I'll share the image I want to
share there which will be where are you
so in the course you'll have noticed
this image at some point where they draw
some boxes so what you have a big box on
the outside over here around basically
like a type of header it has the Udacity
logo inside of it on the far right and
it has a smaller box designating the
designating the person and sort of just
a title right over here then you're
gonna have I don't really know if you
necessarily need a box because it sort
of takes up the whole role anyway but
you kind of I can have a box here and
then you'd have another box probably
right here and then around all of this
where this is this is a box and then
each one of these would be also another
box so right here right here right here
so that's that's sort of what we'll
we'll try to match up here by making
making a grid like that so so that each
like big horizontal box would be one row
right yep and then for each smaller box
would be one that is the idea let's
screen here again
hopefully you can still see okay so
first I believe so you can't you can't
see the new maka yeah you can't see the
mock-up at the same time if maybe you
could you could share that at the same
time so that they have a small tiny
little thing in the corner Flynn sister
right or what I'm trying to do is that
possible can two people share something
at the same time and have it just zoomed
in on anyone I think it shows mine as a
little thing in the corner um okay let's
do that so we don't really need the
first let's just make the boxes so first
we'll have a row inside of that we'll
have the audacity symbol let's say that
that's about the second column and we'll
get to about the second column
all right
hoping for auto-filling but it's not
going to so we'll have one there we're
just making these boxes with nothing in
them at the moment so let's make another
this one can probably go wherever we
want it somewhere between six and ten
it's gonna be right shifted so let's
just say ten that's this is the title
whereas this is the Udacity simple
completely spell that's it but the skill
I have command command back slash our
weight forward slash command forward
slash is the thing that uh well on a Mac
at least that's what automatically makes
it a comment which is nice so this is
the top and now we need another for the
image the big a big image in the middle
there and we'll just say that's a
another class role it's not trainer
colors for that reason that's our image
now we get to the another box which will
hold our where that featured work sign
was featured word yeah
but we always need the class row I don't
really know if this one doesn't really
have a and then next we'll have our
actual this is a problem with me calling
that one features work at the top one
was the featured were literally like the
text that says feature work the next one
will be what actually is the featured
work so we'll have to help with
different name for that featured work
images or yeah sounds good we're gonna
need a rope here because I need to go
all the way across for this so is that
gonna put the images and the text or
alright we could do it either way we
could we'd probably need a separate I
think it's probably easier to include
the text with them because then they'll
be at the same columns it'll just be an
image with text at that man so images
and text need their own thing in the
middle so that'll be fine for doing this
there so these are every four so we'll
just say column four for each of them so
the four specifies the total width here
and then you probably just cut and paste
this copy paste this
and I think that's actually it right
yeah yeah cuz you don't want to include
those colors right so one problem right
now is that I don't have any any way to
tell what the boxes actually look like
so let's just make a star thing here for
that purpose let's see maybe some sort
of Porter box are you trying to do or
just make a border and make it solid see
what everything looks like okay so now I
want to actually open this in a browser
see what it looks like so that does not
look like much at the moment you sure
that it yeah maybe I should have this as
a separate thing so hangouts will
actually share it okay so this is what
that looks like at the moment which is
probably not what we want it to look
like there's nothing in these boxes
right now so let's let's give our margin
should be like 20 pixels and update it
okay
so that's a little bit better let's
instead of just having margin bottom
let's just give margin everything 20
pixels okay that's a little bit better
we're still having the problem that it's
kind of hard to see what's in what it'd
probably be helpful if we actually added
some text to all these things
so let's maybe I'll just I don't even
know if screenshare works fine dual
screening I think it does he just has to
present the both scream okay oh thank
you cool thanks that's okay so let's see
here
what else could I do them well
yeah just put some text in so let's just
say Udacity and title actually what was
the name of it was Joe I always like I
didn't know what yeah instead of making
it wait was it Joe do it or gene gene
zoom in a feminize the last name - okay
Jane do it and then the image will just
say image be sure work no looking over
the whitespace anyway
and now we can see what actually
happened please okay so now we see the
boxes and how they sort of her are
actually taking shape so we have it
looks like one too many well okay so I'm
guessing this is probably the grid the
whole outer one no the whole auto
unlikely to body and this one would be
grid and then these would be the roads
so the roads look like we're supposed to
and thing one thing two in three think
three look like this let's do so that's
good sort of yeah what's on the way
cuz what is it just weird because Jane
do it goes all the rest of the way
across yeah it's probably I think for
that one will need to right shift it but
it's probably easiest to make it go all
the way across just to give it because
otherwise it might just cut off actually
let's experiment with that so right now
we have it at ten let's see what happens
if I have it with six no it doesn't it
doesn't reach the end yeah I think we
need this to add up to 12 so it reaches
the end so with ten it will actually
reach the end until we can right shift
it later on it's cool okay so those are
our basic stuff right there let's see
what else three all now we can actually
start putting in some images and stuff
like that which is always good yeah
actually I probably should just keep
skirt sharing that screen so it's very
useful
okay so I know I have the images I
actually already hosted them on an
injure so that should probably help so
for instance here is the Udacity image
that we can replace that word Udacity
with so it'll just be an image with the
image link I could have also probably
just done a hard file path but I like
posting it online better from there
let's let's get our main image for the
code and put that where the code is
supposed to be it should be right here
then I also have images for instead of
thinking one we have this app our app by
instead of thing - we have over there
flowers and then for thing three okay
let's save it and then refresh so we're
making some progress here
nice so now it says Jane do it up top
here very audacity simple inside a lot
of boxes um so it's it's evidently
giving a border to every image and every
bit of it doesn't look like every bit of
text but every image and then every did
because you can see that this one is
inside this as well feature workers to
the same the amplifi sunflower and I'm
not really sure you call this on the
right okay
um yeah so I know the label was I think
staring if it's right here we can also
add the text right here so let's call
that a header three or four the broking
okay boe be okay eh okay
looks like it's all capitalized too so
we'll put that in and then the text
underneath that I believe is like
there's a link to get up there yeah no
idea if that link works or not but let's
just see if if what we did there had any
effect over there so nice it looks like
we have another starting to fill some
stuff in and add in the text I'll
quickly add in some of the text for a
bunch of these different things then the
same exact thing for sunflower just copy
and pasting that should probably
actually also properly indent this stuff
just to make it look good and then the
last one I think is amplify so once
again see what our effect was there
nice hey paddy no I think Jane DeWitt
was different than it was originally it
also had something else right front end
ninja oh yeah
and I think everything was capitalized -
yeah actually let's make that a header
looks really big so we'll call it each
one nothing else that will call each one
so it'll help us pile eyes it - and then
and I think the headers automatically
make okay the headers already make sort
of a break so we don't have to add a bit
for a break statement there so let's add
that see what looks like cool or we're a
lot of the way - there we have a sort of
HTML structure now so now we need to
start adding CSS which probably means
starting to add some actual classes that
we can actually use with everything I
know that there was the box sizing and
I'm pretty sure the font family also I
wrote this down ahead of time so back in
our CSS so I suppose we can take this
margin away hopefully that's unnecessary
by now and we don't really need the
extra to keep the borders for now but
have Brock sizing
reporter box and then the font family is
lotto I think at least that's what I was
told on the our website so hopefully
it's right okay so now it's looking more
like it was probably supposed to where I
would say we're 3/4 the way there but
we're really not
we're really not at all
my 3/4 of the way to the point where you
can start playing with it on your own
and sort of making them things which
we're actually truly perfectly matching
it or we're really not even that close
because a lot of the work is going to
get things to be exactly how you want it
but the exactly want to padding that you
want it with the exact fonts you want
the same colors that you want and all
that fun stuff so let's see let's add
some classes so our first class it'll be
class row but it will also be our header
so what's a good work what's a good
class name for a header I don't wanna
I hope it's header already taken I feel
like header just a little closer like
you mean be like Oh top one sure so
we'll have top line there and then maybe
maybe we want this one The Audacity
symbols gonna be pretty simple it's just
gonna be on the image right there
but maybe this one we want to stylize
something in it so we'll call this
titles definitely taken okay um name is
also T okay let's see what should we
call it
signature within that yeah signature
signature probably misspelled that long
as it's consistent yeah it's all that
really matters I suppose
um it's going to bug me it's okay I'll
actually let's clean this up as well
make everything a little bit more
readable these should work we should
probably give or two okay that looks
pretty readable there so next we need
our image our main in our center so
maybe we'll just call it center image
featured work we could just literally
call featured work um I'm actually not
actually not sure what the standard is
for words like this like I kind of want
to use cap like snake case or underscore
underscore don't store anything up your
- you know I don't work that's enough
compared to what I would call just make
all the I'll be in the grid stuff uses
dashes okay yeah dashes are clearly safe
there so well that's thing there - and
then this one if this was featured work
and maybe we can call this this should
all be the same so all these should be
identical so every our feature work data
and that should be all the classes that
we probably need so let's just copy and
paste them all in
I actually might just be easier to
separate for a second
so up line next one was signature copy
and pasting so if I have spelling
mistake one place it propagates research
better than it not propagating yeah
probably breaking multiple standards
here but that's alright you clean that
up at the end this isn't a very large
project so that should be it for what we
need right here now it's time to
actually put some stuff in so our tough
line I'm pretty sure that we're gonna
want we're gonna want a border bottom
here so I'm looking at the thing so the
bottom we're gonna want it to be solid
and I think it gives us the color right
yeah yeah it's BC wait come on I think
it does BB BB yeah okay let's let's just
try it and see what happens we see BB BB
it looks sort of actually let's take
away these borders we might want to take
away yeah okay let's try this again oh
that already looks a lot better
yeah so taking away the borders we have
our gray line there okay so let's see
what we all need our signature is going
to have to be right aligned so let's
make sure that happened so by the line
that's good on our center image how do
you align an image
if you just use flat down on that Center
this is what the internet is for do any
students have questions on what we've
done so far since we're now to the point
where we're actually going to start sort
of experimenting to try to get things
basically we're far enough along that we
can actually really start to experiment
to get how we want to look as opposed to
just that would say blindly following
along but like we have this structure
here so now we're really going to be
playing with the CSS to get things to
look exactly like we want them I think
you and using so we have X - align it is
still text Epsilon yeah okay
so just Center if that changes anything
you're not let's just inspect the
element and see if undoing that makes
something there it's
so and Senator seems to be doing
something so what happens if I say right
that didn't seem to have any effect know
if you if you use margin auto okay let's
try that actually
let's just try that here and to answer
your question Julie is there a limit to
the number of classes you can combine in
any one Duke why not I don't think there
is you just need to keep putting a space
and then add another class you know
there's a practical limit I mean you
have to keep them all straight in your
head yeah yeah I don't know I would try
to use less than five just to like not
go crazy trying to keep track of all the
classes and if you are using that many
that often you might consider just
putting them all together in a single
class yeah I don't it's mostly a mental
thing there you want things to me is
easy to understand as possible for both
it's not just for your sake its if you
ever shared codes if anyone helped or
actually you can kind of look at it code
readability doesn't just affect other
people trying to help you it affects you
trying to pick up your work anytime
after you forgotten what you've done
which is if you ever pick up your work a
month after you left it you'll notice
the difference you'll notice a very
large difference in where you commented
well and and you know sort of did
classes in a logical manner from where
you just sort of hacked something
together and have no idea what you're
doing or when you come back to it
because you didn't really like
have a good sense of what was going on
okay also you need to set the width of
that of that image I think do you want
it do you want it we want to send all
the way across right I probably yeah
though the width like a hundred percent
I think let's see if that does mean is
that is that image have that class on it
cuz it doesn't seem to be changing
that's our image
oh maybe maybe that image itself needs
to have that class rather than the row
yeah let's give it a shot
if I found hair that you're carrying on
over time yes
okay let's see your fret does anything
oh yes it does yeah maybe too much okay
that's a big thing though because now we
can actually play with these like we're
supposed to instead of just blindly in
hoping hoping something works with OTO
so it looks like it's let's just keep it
try to be centred in stilettos yeah now
it stays centered and not trying I think
the problem is that it what we'd want it
to do is then if we had wood equals 100
friend wouldn't you better to put the
image inside of do for that change
anything well I think what we it is
technically inside of it if it's right
but we have health center image be part
of its dude that did not affect anything
at all because that was what we're just
trying to do is there a way to have a
max height height yes there is if you
can give it an actual max height height
like 500 pixel art let's just make it
small so we know what that thing is
it'll probably stretch it out right I
don't think so no you're right yes okay
so that's that's how we can do that
that's a that might be what we want yeah
I think it is okay so let's make that
slightly larger let's have that be 300
pixels okay that seems more like what
we're trying to get at resize the window
nice okay I like it seem to work
you got that down featured work I think
we want about a specific color and font
right no what was the font again or not
the font the color the other thing is
bebe I know
PC isn't it same color gray as a B C BBB
okay let's try that out it's gonna be
here to me no little sure Oh
wear that what I wanted I should
probably go find ya
yep okay the text the different font
there okay an idea with the font or
getting into more complicated thing as
we're trying to actually figure out what
font it is you know how they get um
which is which could take serious time
we put in we know I put in I thought I
did I thought I did that for literally
everything but since soon huh yeah it's
alright let's keep moving okay so Julie
asks why why that image bleed over to
the other dibs when it was too big
well it had this it was scaling itself
without a max it didn't have a max
height and so since we specified 100%
width and tried to keep proportionality
I don't know why I decided to keep
proportionality but I assume it's just
how browse this browser is written
probably how most bars are written and
we didn't have anything that yeah I
don't think I think that's just it it's
I suppose the real question is why I
didn't just push everything else down
right I'm not sure you know
yeah okay think it should right that
would be the expected behavior is to
push all the other dips down because the
div should expand to fit whatever's
inside it yeah that's a good question so
maybe you gonna play around a little bit
with this while you are you keep going
Luke okay we are actually over time by
now but let's just Center the text here
make it look a little bit better
probably give we ever do anything that's
our h1 h2 stuff this looks about to be
the right size but amplify it should
probably follow through figure so I
think that was a ch3 right so since we
only have that we could we could make
another class for each of these
individual things but right now since
they're the only h2s and it looks like
that's it I'll be lazy and do this so
font size if you like these guys a
little bit bigger color I think this was
that one of the other colors so I'm
guessing next the 74770 for that's like
I never did anything like this featured
work fun either
don't know for like I figured it out
early
yeah because uh if you take the margin
Auto out oh no just kidding
wait yeah you take the margin Auto out
then it will cause the image to bleed
over so it actually it'll adjust the
margin of the dip to push over into the
other dip gotcha
I think yeah so interesting yeah I mean
I can I can share the screen if you guys
want to see a seen example so this is
what we have over here running into
before we had margin Auto now it's
causing yeah so do you guys still yeah
so that's how the misshapen but then if
you take the Meijer Janata out and I
will just suggest looks good no okay
actually we're quite a bit over time so
I'm just going to like this is this is
the race to the gist of what you do from
here you play around with things you get
things to look how you want you
constantly experiment refresh see what
it looks like go back to bacterial CSS
experiment some more
basically it's a constant side up cycle
of you test you make some changes you
test some more and then you look a lot
of stuff up online because by this point
no one really knows exactly like what
you might be going to Google Fonts try
to find exactly what font you want if
you can't find it like just for knowing
it you're probably going to be playing
around with like the margins padding all
that stuff to get everything exactly the
right size probably the font sizes
you're gonna be playing around with
you're probably going to be trying to
get the spacing like right now this h1
is quite a bit separated from the Jane
Jane de Wet it's quite a bit separated
from front and enjo it looks like I
don't really want any space there at all
so I'd have to look up like probably
putting in I think that's probably being
h1 thing for padding there margin bring
it down to zero or something really
small stuff like that so did anyone have
any final questions before we go off
there okay well I hope I hope this was
educational for everybody maybe you guys
even enjoyed yourselves but good night
