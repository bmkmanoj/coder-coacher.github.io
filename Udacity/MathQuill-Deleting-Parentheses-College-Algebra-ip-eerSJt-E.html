that's allowing us to write many of the
things in this class really beautifully
so when we want you to enter things like
X to the fourth over to it actually
looks like this in the spot where you
input things but as great and powerful
as math cool is there are a couple of
little video synchronic things that you
should know about how to enter things
especially when it comes to using
parentheses you may have noticed that if
you type one parentheses one opening
parenthesis that is in a text box with
math call is being implemented then the
closing parenthesis appears as well and
you'll be typing in this spot in the Box
in between them this generally makes
your life much easier but in certain
situations it can be kind of tricky one
of these interesting and potentially
troublesome features is that once you
have set of parentheses and something
written inside them if you want to
delete the parentheses but leave
whatever you've written inside then you
can't have your cursor sitting out here
and then press Delete because that will
delete the entire expression so let's
say you'd written 26m inside parentheses
if you put your cursor right here and
press delete or backspace everything
would disappear if instead however of
having the cursor out here to the right
of the entire expression in the
parentheses you put the cursor just
inside of the opening parentheses so
just to the right of it then you can
press delete or backspace or whatever
your computer uses to get rid of things
before the cursor and that will leave
you with whatever was written inside of
the parentheses originally I'd like you
to get some practice with how this works
using this expression right here so once
it comes time for you to take this quiz
I'd like you to type in 3 plus open
parentheses 2xy minus 70 parentheses X Z
and then to close parentheses and then
in as few key strokes as possible change
this to just three plus 2xy minus seven
X Z this is just giving you a chance to
figure out how to delete parentheses
about deleting expressions that were
inside of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
