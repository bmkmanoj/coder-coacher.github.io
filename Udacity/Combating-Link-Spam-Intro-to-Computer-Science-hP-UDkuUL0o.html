the compute ranks code in order to take
into consideration whether links are
reciprocal or not so what we want to
know is is AC a reciprocal link it's a
reciprocal link if there is a path from
C back to a of at most length K where K
is a number that's given to us if there
is a path back then we won't include a
in the calculation for C's rank so I'm
going to look at the values of K K
equals 0 I'm going to ask is AC
reciprocal and then from that I'll be
able to tell whether to include a or not
in the calculation of C's rank so if K
equals 0 this is the link we're looking
at if K equals 0 the only links that are
excluded other self links links to the
page itself so AC is not reciprocal in
this case and we should include a MCs
calculation if K equals 1 we're looking
to see if there's a direct link back
from C to a and there isn't so AC is not
reciprocal and we should include a if K
equals 2 we need to see if there's a
path of length 2 from C to a so if we
start at C then we can only get today
that's used at one of the two links were
allowed to click on to get back to a so
what we want to know now is can we click
on one link from D to get back to a and
the answer is no we can't which means
that AC is not reciprocal we should
include a if K equals three we're going
to do the same again we start at C we go
today using up one link then we want to
know if by using two clicks we can get
back from D to a let's have a look at
that from D we can get to B and then
that uses at one link and then can we
get to a with one more link yes we can
because there's a direct
linked from B to a which means that AC
is reciprocal and we should not include
a if K is greater equal to three then
there's definitely a path of length at
least three in there which means we
should not include a for any values of K
greater than or equal to three and so
now we're going to code that we're going
to code a procedure to check whether AC
is reciprocal and then we're going to
edit the code in compute ranks to take
that into consideration so this is the
supplied code I'm going to change it to
include a second input K and then we
want to know whether we have that
reciprocal link or not so we include the
page if we don't have a reciprocal link
in the graph we're going to include node
in the calculation if the link nodes to
page is not reciprocal so I just need to
adjust the spacing here and that's all
the change that we need to do to compute
ranks to code is reciprocal link I'm
going to use recursion so if K is zero
that was the first case we looked at in
the example then we have a reciprocal
link whenever the destination and the
source are the same so in that case I'll
return true and otherwise we return
false if K is not equal to zero then
it's at least one which means if there's
a direct link from the destination to
the source then there's most definitely
a reciprocal link and if that's not the
case we're going to look at every node
that is linked to from destination and
we're going to check if there's a path
of links from that node to the source of
length K minus 1 we've already use one
step going from destination to node that
leaves us with K minus 1 steps left so
if there is a path in other words if
reciprocal link graphs we're in the same
graph
we've got the same source we've got our
new node which is hopefully one step
closer to the destination if that's true
then we're going to return true and if
there is no node for which that's true
we're going to return false and that
completes the procedure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
