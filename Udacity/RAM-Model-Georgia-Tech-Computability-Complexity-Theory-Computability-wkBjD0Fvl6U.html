there are other curious variants of the
basic Turing machine we can restrict
them so that a symbol on any given
square can only be changed once we can
let them have two way infinite tapes or
even let them be non-deterministic we'll
examine this idea when we get to
complexity all these things are
equivalent to Turing machines in the
sense that we've been talking about and
it's good to know that they're
equivalent ultimately however I thought
that the equivalence of those models
does much to convince anyone that Turing
machines capture the common notion of
computation to make that argument will
show that a Turing machine is equivalent
to the random access model which very
closely resembles the basic CPU register
memory paradigm behind the design of
modern computers here is a
representation of the RAM model instead
of operating with a finite alphabet like
a Turing machine the RAM model operates
with non-negative integers which can be
arbitrarily large it has registers
useful for storing operands for basic
operations and an infinite storage
device analogous to the tape of a
regular Turing machine I'll call this
memory for obvious reasons there are two
key differences between this memory and
the tape of a regular Turing machine one
is that each position on this device
stores a number and the other is that
any element can be read with a single
instruction instead of having to move
ahead over the tape to the right spot in
addition to this storage the machine
also contains the program itself
expressed as a sequence of instructions
and a special register called the
program counter which keeps track of
which instruction should be executed
next every instruction is one of a
finite set that closely resembles the
instructions of assembly code for
instance we have the reads instruction
read J which reads the contents from the
j 'the address on the memory and places
it in register 0 register 0 by the way
has a special status and is involved in
almost every operation we also have a
write operation which writes to the J
the address in memory from r0 for moving
data between registers we have load
which writes to r0 and store which
writes from it
as well as ad which increases r0 by the
amount in r.j. all these operations
cause the program counter to be
incremented by one after they're
finished to jump around in the list
however we have a series of special jump
instructions that change the program
counter sometimes depending on the value
in r0 and finally of course we have the
halt instruction to end the program the
final value in r0 determines whether we
accept or reject note that in our
definition here there's no
multiplication we can achieve that
through repeated addition we won't have
much use for the notation surrounding
the RAM model but nevertheless it's good
to write things down mathematically as
this sometimes sharpens our
understanding in this spirit we say that
a random access Turing machine consists
of a natural number K indicating the
number of registers and a sequence of
instructions pi the configuration of a
random access machine is defined by the
counter value which is 0 for the halting
state and indicates the next instruction
to be executed otherwise also we have
the register values and the values in
memory which can be expressed as a
function note that only a finite number
of the addresses will contain a nonzero
value so this function always has a
finite representation we'll use 1 based
indexing hence the domain for the tape
is the natural numbers starting from 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
