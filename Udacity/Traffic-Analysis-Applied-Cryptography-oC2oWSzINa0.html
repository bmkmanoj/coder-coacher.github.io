to use the transport layer security
protocols to first do a handshake to
agree on a secret key and then to have a
secure channel between a client and
server what these messages are we just
drew as arrows but what they really are
if we think about the Internet well
they're messages going through routers
on the Internet and there may be many
hops between the client and the server
and along these hops will go packets
because they're using TLS part of the
packet is an encrypted message but
another part of the packet is the
routing information this is necessary so
r1 knows the direction to send the
message it needs to know that the goal
is to reach the server so any
eavesdropper who can see one of these
messages and it could be the first one
from the client to the first router or
maybe she's intercepting a message on
some later ratting path well she can
learn that the client and the server are
talking to each other this is a form of
traffic analysis where the important
property we want to hide is not the
contents of the message which if HTTPS
is working correctly are encrypted and
cannot be understood by Eve but what we
really want to hide is the fact that
this client is talking to this server or
that alice is talking to Bob the mere
presence of communication between two
parties is often enough to cause
problems an example would be if the
client is a dissident in some oppressive
country and is connecting to a server
that's used by dissidents to communicate
or a server in another country that's
viewed as a threat so if we want to
prevent this kind of traffic analysis we
want to prevent adversaries who can
observe messages on the routers from
being able to know which parties are
communicating we need to do something
else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
