in order to use one way ANOVA the first
is normality all the populations from
which the samples are from are normally
distributed another is homogenate a of
variance the data come from populations
that have equal amounts of variability
and finally independence of observations
the results found from one sample won't
affect the others however we can violate
these assumptions under certain
conditions we can violate the normality
assumption if the sample size is large
we can violate the homogeneity of
variance assumption if all the samples
have nearly equal sample sizes and the
ratio of any two variances does not
exceed four we have to maintain
independence of observations but we can
use random assignment two conditions to
help us meet this assumption let's do a
quick summary of ANOVA to wrap up this
lesson I'm not actually going to wrap
this time though we're just going to
wrap up the lesson if we have three or
more samples and we want to know if any
two of them are significantly different
we look at both the between group
variability and the within group
variability between group variability is
a measure of how spaced apart these
sample means are from each other and we
do that by finding the grand mean and
each squared deviation from the ground
mean for each sample mean we multiply
each sample size by the squared
deviation of each sample mean from the
grand mean then we add them up then we
have to look at the within group
variability which is essentially the
square deviation of each value in each
sample from the respective sample mean
so we add up all sums of squares from
the respective sample mean and then we
have to find the average sum of squares
for each by dividing by the degrees of
freedom in the case of the between
groups this is the number of samples
minus 1 and 4 within
ropes this is the total number of values
minus the number of groups this is the
same as adding the degrees of freedom
for each group there we have our F
statistic and if it falls out here in
the critical region passed the f
critical value will reject the null
after making a statistical decision we
can use the multiple comparison test one
of which is two keys honestly
significant difference which is a value
that if any two sample means have a
difference greater than that value
they're considered honestly
significantly different you've also
learned how to determine what proportion
of the difference between means is due
to the independent variable that's a 2
squared and that's a wrap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
