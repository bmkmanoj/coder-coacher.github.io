problem right so let's assume that a
robot knows the 3d map of its world okay
and for now we're just going to worry
about a robot running around on the
floor so it's not climbing stairs it's
just running around and let's assume
also that it has noisy depth sensors so
it can measure depth in a lot of
different directions and they're noisy
so the measurement is uncertain but we
know about the uncertainty that is we
have a sensor model okay and it moves
between frames and it takes a set of
readings and then it moves again and
takes a set of readings and it moves
again but the idea is it keeps taking
all these readings and the question is
how well can it know its state so what
is its state Montana no its state is
three values X Y and theta its
orientation okay that's why we're just
doing a mobile robot on the ground three
dimensions alright so just to remind you
in a billet bayesian filter framework we
need for things we need some sort of a
prior remember that trip to delphi so
you unpack your next prior we need a
dynamical system model and that's the
likelihood of landing in some new place
given that you were an old place plus
whatever action was taken we need a
sensor model remember a likelihood
that's the not the probability of being
someplace given a measurement the
likelihood is a probability of getting
the measurement given what your state
was and then we need this stream of
observations and the action data the Z's
in the use for that robot that I
described the state is obvious the map
will be easy et cetera the thing that's
tricky not tricky the thing we have to
define is the sensor model so here's a
picture of a sensor model and what this
is is this is the probability of getting
a particular measurement if let's say
the actual state was here on this black
line okay and what was nice is when
you're using a real robot you can
actually measure the likelihood so you
you stick the sensor you know three
meters away or let's see that's
centimeters so 200 so two point three
centimeters away from the wall
you turn it on you turn it on your truck
you collect a whole bunch of
measurements and you see what you get
that distribution would be this
distribution okay and in fact the blue
is what was measured right so that's why
the Blues got the noisy stuff and the
red is how they approximated and you can
see they basically had some sort of a
Gaussian function or something like that
in fact you can see that the laser has a
less noise than the sonar okay so this
is actually relatively noisy laser a
modern laser would be you know very
precise except that you might have some
specular problems cetera so all of that
would be fine except you'll notice
there's this thing here and this thing
there and the question is what's going
on when you know the thing is 2.3 meters
away and here it says 500 but the astute
observer will notice you're just using
the very last value well what that
really is is that's the probability that
you get no return okay so you're some
distance from the wall you send out your
sonar chirp or you send out your laser
and it just goes away gets on a train
never comes back this happens you guys
know what specular reflections are right
so in light bounces off to turns out
that sheetrock is very specular to sonar
so when you send out a sonar chirp often
it doesn't come back it skips like it
reflects off in which case you don't
ever hear the chirp come back or it
comes back after having gone through a
long echo path likewise if you're
looking at something that's shiny like a
glass wall when you point at it you can
see the laser beam but when you point it
on the side okay it'll be reflective
it'll be a specular so what these values
are is the probability of getting no
return given that you're at some
distance and in fact that probability
stays the same pretty much no matter
what your distances all right so
remember this is not the probability
that your distance is actually 500 it's
the probability that you would get
there's no return at any given point in
time okay so we need to incorporate that
noisy model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
