we typically look to its form and design
to give us an idea of what it does and
how it works a classic example is a
kettle I can look at this kettle and
recognize that the handle side is the
one I meant to grab even if I've never
seen one before because I've seen the
same basic shape on things like coffee
mugs pots peaches and various other
things it serves a practical purpose its
shape so I can comfortably get my hand
around it and it's insulated but also
the fact that I've seen many similar
handles before gives me a visual clue
here after all I could probably pick the
kettle up by the spout if I really
wanted although I'd probably end up
burning myself and it to be pretty
tricky to pull water out of it when it
comes to graphical user interfaces a fun
still still represent the actions we can
take but now they're more metaphorical
since there's no physical object to
interact with some classic examples of
technology affordances are buttons you
will be hard-pressed to find any
software UI without at least one button
on it and sliders from scroll bars to
playback controls to price limits
something I like to think about is how
real-world objects get translated into
purely visual metaphors to create those
affordance keys for graphical user
interfaces for example you can clearly
see a button on a keyboard reflected in
a button element and a checkbox on a
ballot paper in a checkbox element while
some graphical UI affordances may not be
immediately obvious to new users for
example someone new to computers might
need to experiment to learn to use
scroll bars
people generally learn the visual keys
quickly with little or no training
well-designed affordances enable people
to do something with as little training
as possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
