that numpy will allow us to do very
easily numpy has an umpire dot dot
function that will allow us to easily
take the dot product between two vectors
let's walk through what it means to take
the dot product first let's say I have
an array called a whose values were 1 2
3 4 &amp;amp; 5 and then I had an array called B
whose values were 2 3 4 5 &amp;amp; 6 these two
vectors are indexed in the following way
let's say that the zeroth entry of a is
1 in the zeroth entry of B is 2 and the
first entry of a is 2 and the first
entry of B is 3 and so on the way that
we take the dot product is we say we're
going to multiply together the 0th entry
of the two arrays and then we're going
to add that to the sum of the first
entry of the two arrays and then we're
going to add that to the product of the
second entry of the arrays and so on so
in this case we end up with 1 times 2
plus 2 times 3 plus 3 times 4 plus 4
times 5 plus 5 times 6 which is 70 we
could easily do this in numpy using
numpy dot dot just watch here I define a
and B just as we did a moment ago if we
just say numpy a B I get 70 I can also
use the numpy dot dot function to
multiply arrays into matrices if you're
not familiar with how to multiply an
array into a matrix you should follow
the online resources found in the
instructor notes but for now just know
that if we have this array 1 2 in this
matrix 2 3 4 5 6 7 we would essentially
multiply them together and get an array
where the first entry is 1 times 2 plus
2 times 3 the second entry is 1 times 4
plus 2 times 5 and the third entry is 1
times 6 plus 2 times 7 if we perform
this multiplication down here we would
get a to entry array where the top entry
is 2 times 8 plus 4 times 9 plus 6 times
10 and the bottom entry is 3 times 8
plus 5 times 9 plus 7 times 10 since
these multiplications don't commute
numpy is smart enough to throw an error
if you try to ask it to do something
that doesn't make sense let's say I want
to
to perform this multiplication right
here and I call this guy a in this guy B
I could simply call numpy a B and what I
get back is eight fourteen twenty just
as we would get if we perform this
arithmetic here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
