function we've defined say Z F X Y and
then we can say sequence is redefined as
being the nme function of sequence oops
I guess I gotta fix this typo here for
now on I can call sequence and pass it
any number of numbers and it will return
the result that looks like that so that
looks good and in fact this pattern is
so common in Python that there's a
special notation for it and the notation
is called the decorator notation it
looks like this all we have to do is say
at sign then the name of a function and
then the definition and this is the same
as saying sequence equals n area of
sequence it's just an easier way to
write it but there is one problem with
the way we BES ified this particular
decorator which is if I'm in an
interactive session and I ask for help
on sequence I would like to see the
argument list and if there's a doc
string I want to see the documentation
here I didn't happen to put in any
documentation for sequence but when I
asked for help what i get is this i'm
told that sequence is called n every
function well why is that because this
is what we returned when we defined
sequence equals n airy of sequence we
return this thing that has the name and
every function and so we would like to
fix n airy up so that when the object
that it returns has the same function
name and the same function documentation
if there is any documentation and have
that copy it over into the NRI f
function now it turns out that there is
a function to do exactly that and so I'm
going to go get it i'm going to say from
the funk tools the functional tools
package i want to import the function
called update proper update rapper takes
two functions and it copies over the
function name and the documentation and
several other stuff from the old
function to the new function and i can
change n airy to do that so once I've
defined the NRI function
then I can go ahead and update the
wrapper of the NRA function the thing
I'm going to be returning from the old
function and so this will be the old
sequence which has a sequence name a
list of arguments maybe some
documentation string and this will be
the function that we're returning we're
copying over everything from F into NRI
F and now when I ask for help when i
define nara sequence and i have asked
for help on sequence what I'll see is
the correct name for sequence and if
there was any documentation string for
sequence that would appear here as well
so update rappers is a helpful tool it
helps us when we're debugging doesn't
really help us in the execution of the
program but in doing debugging it's
really helpful to know what you know
correct names of your functions are
notice that we may be violating that
don't repeat yourself principal here so
this n airy function is a decorator that
I'm using in this form to update the
definition of sequence I had to within
my definition of NRI I had to write down
that I want to update the rapper but it
seems like I'm going to want to update
the wrapper for every decorator not just
for for NRI and I don't want to repeat
myself on every decorator that I'm going
to define</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
