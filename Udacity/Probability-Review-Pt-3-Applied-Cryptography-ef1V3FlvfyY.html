conditional probability and this is the
one we're going to need to use to prove
that the one-time pad is perfectly
secure so here's our definition of
conditional probability if we have two
events we'll call them a and B and
they're in the same probability space
the conditional probability of B given
that a occurred is written like this so
it's the probability of B given a so we
use the bar to indicate conditional
probability and it's defined by this
formula so it's the probability of a
intersected with B divided by the
probability of a to get an intuition for
that let's look at these sets so here's
our universe of Megha
that's all events and our question is
given that we know a occurred what's the
probability of a so the fact that a
occurred means the rest of our
probabilities set doesn't matter we're
only considering the outcomes where a
occurred so that's this set for a we
want to know what was the probability
that B occurred so that's the elements
in this intersection so they're the
times when B did occur divided by the
size of this set a which is the
probability of a so that's the intuition
behind this formula let's see if it
makes sense for our example as well so
the question is given that we have a
valid coin toss what's the probability
that it's heads and I'll remind you the
model we had said the probability of
heads is 0.49 99 with four nines the
probability of tails is 0.49 nine nine
nine the probability of edge is one
minus the sum of those which is zero
zero zero zero two and we define valid
as the outcomes where it lands on heads
or tails not on the edge given that you
know a coin toss is valid what's the
probability that the outcome is heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
