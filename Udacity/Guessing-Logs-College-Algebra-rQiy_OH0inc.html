second remember that looking for
patterns and making educated guesses
about what's going on and then figuring
out if those guesses are right or wrong
is really what math is all about so why
do we have 1 plus X here and why do we
have 2 plus X here let's look at a new
log for a second log base 10 of 3 and
I'm going to tell you right now that
this is about equal to 0.4 7712 just to
make it perfectly clear that this is
rounded i'm going to change this to an
about equal sign now using what log base
10 of 3 is about equal to what do you
think we get for log base 10 of 30 and
log base 10 of 300 first using the idea
that you came up with before I'd like
you to make a guess about what each of
these is equal to then use a calculator
to get the actual answer and round to
five decimal places you won't be graded
on your guesses so just try it out then
I'd like you to also consider what log
base 10 of 3000 is and then lastly how
about log base 10 of 3 million just so
you know this is equal to log base 10 of
3 times 10 to the sixth so make your
guesses and then check them with a
calculator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
