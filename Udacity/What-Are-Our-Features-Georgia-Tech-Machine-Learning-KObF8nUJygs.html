when we have a bunch of documents let's
say full of words I'm not sure it could
be things like the number of words in
the document that could be but what's
sort of this and actually that's
perfectly reasonable thing what's the
simplest set of features that you might
start with from which you might then
compute more interesting features well
there's a super duper big set of
features which are the words right so in
fact that is exactly what we have is we
have words maybe we have punctuation x'
and you know words are sort of the
obvious thing to do i typed in machine
learning why don't i just return every
single document that has machine
followed by learning maybe you should
maybe I should and maybe that's a
perfectly reasonable thing to do in the
case of machine learning should I return
documents that contain the word machine
but don't contain the word learning I
wouldn't score them very highly ah my
nuts girl is highly but I might still
return them as being at least more
relevant than documents that contain
neither machine nor learning right
they're just about turtles see right
exactly although it's Turtles all the
way down Michael I see okay so if our
features are words which are sort of the
most obvious things get it we can
compute other things like the number of
words or whatever but basically our
features are going to be words or counts
of words or something like that it's
sort of a reasonable first step and in
fact the very early retrieval systems
which you know predate both of us
actually Michael used simple things like
words now there's a lot of way details
to this you could imagine like maybe
you'd want to transform all plurals into
their singular version get rid of words
like Z and there's a bunch of
complicated stuff you might want to do
but it's not particularly relevant for
this discussion so just assume whenever
you want to assume about the kinds of
words that you have okay okay okay so
what's the problem with using words can
you think of any problems with using
words well there's a lot of them right
that's actually the first thing there's
a lot of words which means there are a
lot of features which means the curse of
dimensionality is going to hurt us I
would think that they'd be pretty good
indicators of meaning except I guess
there's kind of two complimentary
problems one is that some words mean
more than one thing mm-hmm I like that
so that we have good indicate words are
good indicators of meaning because you
know they're words but you could be in
the case where you have words mean
multiple
you said there were two problems what's
the second one sort of the opposite
which is you can say the same thing
using completely different words ah yes
so that's that many words mean the same
thing I mean in particular words the
fact that words can have multiple
meanings is called polysemy the fact
that many words can mean the same thing
is called sonata me so can you think of
a word that might have multiple meanings
that indicates the problem of polysemy
well so you know learning in the machine
learning example learning sometimes
refers to this statistical process that
we've been talking about but it also
refers to the thing that people do and
in some in some scenarios it actually
means to teach like I'm gonna learn you
something that's true but that's just to
on point I'm gonna pick something else
that I think you will appreciate the end
let's think of a word like car so car
has multiple meanings Michael can you
think of them I'm mostly stuck on one at
the moment and let's what does he think
of the vehicle that you drive around but
I was like I guess one could also be
referring to a list Deconstructor in
Lisp yes exactly it's the first in a
cons cell cons thank you right so car is
either an automobile or it's the first
element in a con cell which all of you
people who heard of Lisp knows is an
awesome reference for those of you
who've never used lists which is clearly
the greatest language ever written in
all of history or that ever will be
written because it is a super set and
subsumes all other languages including
natural languages imagine this word
instead is Apple and so Apple can refer
to a fruit or can refer to a computer
company or to a music company for that
matter but I prefer car so car can mean
automobile or can mean the first element
in a con cell if you're using Lisp now
sticking to this car example Sonata me
is a similar problem in that car and
automobile often refer to the same thing
so do you see this so polysemy is the
problem of a word meaning multiple
things in Sonata me is the problem of
multiple
words meaning the same thing and a
particular word like car in this case
can cause both polysemy problems and
tsunami problems yeah I could see that
so in the example that you gave before
about machine learning you would if you
just returned documents that had machine
and learning right after each other then
you'd miss all the stuff on for example
data mining right in fact that's a very
good example so there's a huge split in
the commitment the community between
those who care about data mining and
those who care about machine learning
and often the people in one camp don't
believe the people on the other camp are
doing what they're doing but for the
person who isn't religiously committed
to one of those camps or the others when
you talk about machine learning you
probably also care about data mining
when you talk about data mining you
probably also care about what people
inside the field might call instead
machine learning and so you would be
missing out on a whole swath of papers
or interesting discussions if you happen
to put in the word machine learning but
similarly if you put in a word like data
mining you might end up getting all
kinds of documents that are about the
data or about the data that you get when
you literally mined for coal who knows
and it would cause you huge problems for
getting exactly the relevant set of
documents that you want so we can
actually talk about this in terms of the
kind of errors that you get and say
supervised learning what kind of errors
do polysemy give you Michael false
well there's false positive and false
negative and this is one of the things
where we it's going to return things
that aren't relevant it's gonna say
they're positive when they're not so
you've given me the answer false
positive false positives by contrast
anonyme gives you what true positives no
wait i negated the wrong word false
negatives exactly in other words it's
going to wait is that right so false
negative means oh it's going to tell you
something's not there when it actually
really is right so I begin car will not
just give me the automobile articles
about my Tesla which is a black 85 with
black leather
fully loaded and is like the greatest
car on the planet but it'll also give me
really awesome but in this case not what
I'm looking for documents about Lisp
meanwhile when I type in a car I will
actually get all these things on
automobiles but I won't get articles
that talk about auto mode
without actually using the word car so
you can imagine that these sorts of
problems come up all the time you've got
a set of features in this case words
which have this problem that although
they're good indicators they're
insufficient that is we have a set of
features that will generate both false
positives and false negatives on their
own and more to the point doing feature
selection will not solve this problem I
can throw away a bunch of irrelevant
words and even useless words but I'm
still going to have this problem of
being of generating false positives for
polysemy and false negatives or tsunami
and this goes beyond simply information
retrieval and text retrieval into any
generic problem where you have possibly
a large set of features that have this
problem of false negatives and false
positives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
