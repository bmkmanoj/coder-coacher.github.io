couple of exercises because when I
organized all of the chromosomes from
biggest to smallest I left out a pair I
left out the very last pair because as
you noticed there's something very
unique about them they don't match in
size in the pair the way all the other
chromosomes do in fact they're so
different and they're important for a
very different reason that they're not
numbered like the other chromosomes it's
the 23rd pair but each chromosome
because it's unique from the other has
its own name we call the bigger
chromosome the X chromosome and the
smaller chromosome the Y chromosome
together we call these chromosomes the
sex chromosomes all of the rest of the
chromosomes are called autosomes and the
reason we make a distinction is because
the sex chromosomes x and y determined
the sex of the individual what we mean
by sex is whether or not the individual
has male reproductive organs or female
reproductive organs and there's a very
interesting story as to why the Y
chromosome is so much smaller than the X
chromosome and they don't match the
story is awesomely amazing but it's
really outside the scope of our course
so if you're interested you should go
search for more about it on your own the
key point here is that the Y chromosome
triggers male development so if you have
a Y chromosome you're most likely going
to develop as a male without a Y
chromosome ultimately the individual
will develop as a female now I want you
to tell me using this set of chromosomes
that you see right here if this was an
individual's genome what sex would most
likely develop from this set of
chromosomes would you expect to get a
male or a female</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
