manager at Udacity and this is my bad
interview experience so after three
years of engineering college I really
wanted to intern at this one tech
company in Cupertino I spent all year
preparing for this and I knew that this
was the company I wanted to work for I
nailed my first interview and then got
into the second interview which was a
text screen with one of their teens and
I completely failed it I don't even
remember the questions I don't remember
first dizzy or tired or sleepy or what
are just unqualified I guess I that
interview was terrible I spent about two
weeks like depressed about it thinking
about like that is time for me to move
on and find like a different company i'd
be interested in surprisingly the
recruiter called me back and they told
me that they wanted that violate and
make that one position they wanted in
for me for a different one so i agreed
and happily took another interview which
i also failed at that point I realized
that maybe I wasn't cut out to be an
engineer their company and I decided
that I would look at other companies and
finally move on from these dreams but
then the recruiter messaged me again and
said see ya while you're not cut out for
14 engineering positions this summer
would you like to have a product
interview and I didn't know much about
product but I was like sure this is the
company this must be it whatever let's
do this so and that interview went
amazing looking back at that summer I
realized that the product rule was a
much better fit for me than any
engineering role could have been if that
company so my takeaway from this is that
sometimes interviews don't go the way
you want them to and sometimes job
positions don't lighten up the way that
you think they will don't stress too
much about a bad interview because in
the end it just becomes a funny story
