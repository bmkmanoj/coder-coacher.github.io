lifting a rock of 100 kilograms by one
meter if we just want to lift the rock
well our force has to balance the weight
which means you're going to need 1,000
Newton force we're gonna have to exert
that force over one meter exactly the
height of the table if we used to pulley
we had a few options well if it was a
simple pulley with one connection point
we'd have to exert a force of 1,000
Newtons over the full distance of one
meter there was a double pulley we had
to exert half that force but over twice
the distance and so on if we use an
inclined plane well if the angle is 30
degrees we'd have to exert a force of
500 Newtons over a distance of two
meters there is a deep and fundamental
pattern emerging year one thousand times
one one thousand times one 500 times two
250 times four 333 times three and so on
and now it's time for the breakthrough
for all of these seemingly entirely
different ways of moving this block up
by a height of 1 meter something is
constant the force times the distance is
always equal to one thousand one
thousand times 1 333 times 3 500 times -
it doesn't matter
these are all giving you a value of 1000
this quantity force times distance is so
important that we're going to give it
its own name we're going to call it work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
