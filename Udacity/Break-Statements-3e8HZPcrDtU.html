while loops and that's the break
statement break gives us way to stop the
loop even while the test condition is
true so here's the typical structure of
a loop with a break so we have the while
as we did before and we have the test
expression and we had a colon and our
general while structure is we had a
block here now I'm going to look inside
this block a little bit to see the kinds
of things that could be here and this is
just an example of what might be in the
block we have some code we have some
Python statements then we have an if
statement and that's going to have
another test expression we'll call that
to break test that's the test expression
that's checking whether it's time to
take a break and when the break test is
true what we have is break which by
itself is all we need what break means
is stop executing the while loop jump
out of the while loop and continue with
the code after that so whatever we had
here this is more code that was in the
wild block that will get skipped and
we'll jump to this point which is the
code after the while so what happens
when we execute a loop with a break it
executes like a normal loop if the test
expression is true we go to the code if
the break test is false we don't execute
the break we would continue with the
more code we would go back to the loop
test check the test expression again if
it's true we go run this code if the
break test is true then we execute the
break and what break does is jump out of
the loop so we don't execute the more
code we don't execute the test
expression again if the break happens
what happens is we jump to the code
after the while this gives us a way to
break out of the middle of the loop
here's an example of how we might use
that so before we define the procedure
print numbers without using break we
defined it like this so this is the code
we had before we could rewrite that
using break so now instead of having the
while test stop the loop will make the
wild test true true will never become
false that means if we didn't have a
break the loop would keep going forever
but we're gonna add a break we're gonna
have an if test that says well the
stopping condition now is we're going to
stop one
I is greater than n and the way to stop
is to use break if I is not greater than
n then we're gonna keep going we'll do
the same thing we did before well print
aye and we'll add one two so this loop
has exactly the same meaning as the one
we had before the previous one's better
in every way right so this is more
complex as more code this illustrates
how we can use break we wouldn't want to
do it this way this is much worse than
what we had before we want to keep our
code simple and easy to understand we'll
see once we get to the code for
extracting all the links on the page
that there are cases where it's easier
to write the code using break than it is
without that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
