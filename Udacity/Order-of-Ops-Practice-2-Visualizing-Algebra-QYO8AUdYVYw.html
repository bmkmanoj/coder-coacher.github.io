order of operations problem if you got
negative 675 you got the answer right
now this was a tough problem and I even
had to use my calculator now let's see
how I got negative 6 75 when I'm looking
at this problem once again I want to
work from the inner parentheses outwards
following my order of operations so the
first thing I see is an innermost
parentheses of 1 plus 2 so that's the
first operation I'm going to perform
again I want to make sure that I copy
down all of the other operations that I
have not yet performed now that I've
performed the operation in the innermost
parentheses I can do the next level of
parentheses which are these brackets so
I want to do negative 4 times 3 which is
negative 12 from here i see that i have
another operation in parentheses which
is 4-10 so i can evaluate 4-10 which is
negative 6 now that I've performed all
the operations inside parentheses I can
move on to my exponents or my powers so
I have three exponents i have negative 6
squared remember when the negative is
inside the parentheses it's part of the
base so it's negative 6 times negative 6
which is 36 3 squared of course is 9 and
negative 12 squared is 144 now that I've
done all my exponents I can do my
multiplication and division the only
multiplication i have is negative 5
times 144 so i can write 36 plus 9
negative 5 times positive 144 i had to
get my calculator out for this one is
negative 720 now that I've done on my
multiplication and division I can do my
addition and subtraction in order from
left to right so first thing I have to
do is 36 plus 9 which is 45-7 20 45-7 20
gives me the negative 675 great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
