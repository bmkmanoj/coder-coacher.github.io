incremental concept learning more
systematically in more detail this time
imagine that there is an AI program and
there is a teacher which is going to
teach the air program about the concept
of an arch so teacher gives a first
example and suppose the teacher gives
the example which has four bricks in it
to vertical bricks that are not touching
each other and there is a third brake on
top of it and a fourth brick on top of
it to the AI program the input may look
a little bit like this there are four
bricks a b c and d and there are some
relationships between these four blocks
so brick c is on left of break d brixi
supports p brick d supports brick be as
well and brick be supports break a this
then is the input what made the AI
program learn from this one single
example well not very much for this one
single example the air program can only
variable eyes there were this constants
here brick a brick be brixey brick d
instead the AI program may be able to
variable eyes this constants and say
well brick a is an instance of brick and
therefore i just have brick here brick p
is an instance of a brick therefore I
just have a brick here so now I can have
any break in these places as long as
these relationships hold it's an example
of an arch note the first example was a
positive example now we are going to see
a series of positive and negative
examples and each time we see an example
the air program would either generalize
or specialized if which is a positive
example then it may generalize if the
positive example is not covered by the
current concept definition if it is a
negative example it may specialize the
current definition of the concept to
exclude that negative example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
