the form of enhanced execution
environments so I've already used the
example several times but in C or C++ we
could run the compiled program under a
runtime monitor like valgrind which
provides an enhanced execution
environment which checks a lot of rules
that aren't checked by the regular c and
c++ runtime or by the operating system
so for example valgrind will terminate
our process if we access beyond the end
of an array and practice that's an
extremely effective form of Oracle if
that kind of a rule violation happens
during random testing we absolutely want
to know about it and vargran provide
that provides that service another
example of an instrument of an enhanced
exclusion environment would be one the
checks for for example integer overflow
of problems or floating-point problems
so a medium Oracle is going to vary in
its degree of checking power between the
week Oracle's we have ready said in
strong Oracle's it'll talk about in a
few minutes and so far in my list and I
could be missing something but so far i
only have one example of a medium power
oracle and this is assertion checks that
the programmer has put into the software
the reason i call this a medium power
oracle is it provides quite a lot more
application specific kind of checking
than do these weak Oracle's but on the
other hand it doesn't guarantee anything
even remotely close to actual correct
operation and that's generally what the
strong Oracle's are going to do so let's
look at those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
