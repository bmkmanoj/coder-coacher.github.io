totally non-trivial multiplying
something with a plus B modifies the
mean in a very straightforward way so
this is the right expression here a mu
times B so 6-foot up into my answer over
here you already know that adding a
constant doesn't change the spread of a
distribution so the result should not
have a be inside that takes out this
term and all those terms we also know
that the spread has nothing to do with a
mean so this term is out so the question
really is it is it a Sigma square or a
square Sigma Square and if you remember
correctly maybe we did the salary raised
by a factor of 10 percent we notice that
the standard deviation goes up by this
factor therefore the variance goes up by
the square of this factor and one was
the right answer here and not 7 and
that's interesting because in doing
arithmetic with the mean and the
variance you have to be very
conscientious as to where they use the
variance or the standard deviation if
you get that wrong then you get the
wrong answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
