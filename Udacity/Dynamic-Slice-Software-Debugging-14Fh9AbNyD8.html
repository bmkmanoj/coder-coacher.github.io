that they can be determined
automatically that is a slicing tool can
automatically determine backward slices
of individual statements and forward
slices of individual statements such
static slicing tools therefore can help
you focus on specific parts of the
program telling you the possible
influences either off a statement or the
possible influences towards a statement
such slices become even more interesting
though when we apply them not only to
programs but to actual executions these
are then called dynamic slices these
apply to executions instead of programs
that is rather than reasoning in a
program where a value came from you look
at the actual execution typically the
failing execution and therefore not only
know what could have happened but
actually see what has happened the base
of our enemy's slice is not the program
but a trace instead a trace lists the
statements in the program in the order
in which they were executed so if line
three for instance was executed four
times in a row then the trace will
contain line three four times followed
by line four for a benign five and
possibly going back to nine three in
case there's a loop within the trace we
can now look again at dependencies that
is looking at which variables have been
read and which variables have been
written and if we find say that at the
bottom of the trace some variable is
wrong we can now trace back the
dependencies in the execution and again
use this as a base for debugging when
following back the cause-effect chain
through the program the first thing we
need for this is a trace let me show you
how to get traces for Python programs so
here again we have our original remove
HTML markup function and what I've
written down here is again a tracing
function which accesses the file name of
the code as well as the current line
numbers that's executed and we print
this out on standard output we record
this as a tracing function let's use the
buggy version of the remove HTML markup
function here in order to have some of
fun and we feed it with this very simple
input just two characters double quote
and less than sign which should expose
the error if when I go and execute this
then we should be able to see a sequence
of lines as they're executed and we
click on run and what we see here is
that first line four was executed then
line 5 then line 6 then line 9 then line
11 line 13 line 14 and this is how we
progress through the program execution
now for a bit of programming exercise
complete the program which you just seen
such that it prints out the actual code
lines instead of just the filename and
number that is replace the output of
filename and number by the actual code
line that is in that file at this
position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
