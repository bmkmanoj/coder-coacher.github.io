use the mouse to control or influence
what's happening in the scene is handled
using events an event is generated by
the system whenever a user presses a key
or uses the mouse there are other kinds
of events but these two keyboard and
mouse input are the main ones we care
about in 3gs well I should mention
there's also a touch interface that's
somewhat similar to the mouse interface
so that you can interact with scenes on
a smartphone or other touch-sensitive
display you can ignore any and all
events or can listen for any of you wish
here's code for listening to a mouse
click event specifically mouse down
which means when the mouse is first
clicked if you want to wait until the
mouse button was released you would
listen for mouse up the ad listener
event takes a function name as an input
whenever the mouse button is clicked
this function is called this code
defines the function called onmousedown
this prevent default line is optional it
makes your program not pass the mouse
event on up to the page running your
JavaScript program I usually don't use
this call the rest of this function is
up to you a mouse or key click could
modify an object start an animation you
name it enough talk what follows is an
example of using the mouse down event to
perform picking you are orbiting around
a bunch of blocks try clicking at a
block as you move past them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
