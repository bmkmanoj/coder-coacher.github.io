thing it's going to turn out so it's
important to figure out how we can take
a bunch of numbers and make them satisfy
the heap property so so let's do that
let's start figuring out how that will
work first thing to notice is that any
one node tree satisfies the heap
property because it can't be bigger or
smaller than the parent or the child
because it doesn't have any parents or
child so so that case is really easy but
now so let's imagine that we've somehow
managed to create two heaps and we'd
like to join them together by adding
another node and have it as the heap
property hold so both of these sub trees
the heap property holds which means the
smallest values and the entire heap are
sitting here at the top at the relative
roots but now we're adding a new node if
this node is already smaller than these
two then everything's fine but it might
not be it might be that this is a large
value so let's give an example so what
do we do at this point we need the heap
property to hold everywhere for this to
actually be a heap so what can we do
well so with respect to these three
nodes we're going to need to change
something to establish the heap property
at least locally so first thing we're
going to do is we're introduced some
swapping around which value can we swap
to the top to move things in the
direction of more establishing the heap
property so which of these values should
be at the root here write the answer in
the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
