of the forward Euler method so this X at
the initial step is actually 2d vector s
is the why and the result will again be
a 2d vector with those two values for
the two trajectories in it the resulting
diagram may need some explanation we see
the distance between the X values of the
two trajectories over the course of time
so initially they are really close 10 to
the minus 14 and then they grow and
eventually become macroscopic 10 100 the
important thing to be seeing is this
linear slope but actually it's not
linear we are working with a logarithmic
vertical axis which means that the
distance grows in exponential fashion it
takes about 30 units of time to increase
the arrow from 10 to the minus 14 to 10
to the minus 4 these are 10 orders of
magnitude a factor of 1 to 10 billion
this leads to the following conclusion
whenever there is an uncertainty about
the initial conditions however tiny the
effect of this uncertainty will quickly
grow to a visible size so even though
the system is deterministic once we have
fixed the initial conditions everything
is determined even though that is the
case its behavior looks random this
sensitive dependence on initial
conditions is the hallmark of
deterministic chaos and it is to be
expected that every system which
includes convection also inherits this
aspect if somewhere a butterfly flaps
its wings some days or month afterward
this is going to change the weather at
some remote location on the earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
