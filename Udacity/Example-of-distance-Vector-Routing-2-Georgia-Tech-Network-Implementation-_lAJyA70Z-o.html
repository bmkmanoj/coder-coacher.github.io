the sake of illustration I've increased
the cost between X and Z 250 and now
everyone starts with a different set of
initial distance vectors now eventually
after running the distance vector
protocol we would see the tables
converge as such let's suppose that the
cost of the link between x and y
suddenly increased from 1 to 60 well now
in this case Y would need to update its
view of the shortest path between y and
X now it's no longer one but it's not 60
either to see why let's go back to our
bellman-ford equation we can see that Y
fix-it can get to Z with the cost of 2
and that Z can get to X with the cost of
3 so in fact it's going to update this
entry from 1 to 5 then it will tell its
neighbor Z its new distance vector in
other words that now its distance to X
is no longer one but 5 at this point Z
needs to recompute its shortest path to
X now it knows that it can get to Y with
the cost of 2 but it thinks still that Y
can get to X with the cost of 5
therefore this entry is no longer 3 but
7 and now Z sends its new distance
vector back to y y then updates its
distance vector for Z and this process
continues so then Y thinks it is now 9
units away from X so Z has to do this
all over again and now Z thinks that its
shortest path is 2 plus 9 or 11 now this
process repeats of course until Z
finally realizes that it has a shorter
path of 50 directly through X after this
counting up process exceeds the value of
50 this problem is called the
count-to-infinity problem and the
solution is called poison reverse the
idea here is that if Y must route
through Z to get to X in its table as it
did here then Y advertises an infinite
cost for the destination X to Z so
instead of sending 5 0 to Y would send
infinity 0 2 this would thus prevent Z
from routing back through Y and
immediately it would choose the short
path to X of path cost 50</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
