powerful but it raises a lot of
questions that certainly being able to
intercept people's cell your
communication could be used for evil
presumably you're not using it for evil
so what's the what's the motivation for
doing this and kind of how how are how
can you do this in an ethical way we're
clearly not doing this to do evil
ourselves however we do this because it
is already used to do evil biases for at
least 10 years industrial-scale gsm
cracking equipment has been available
and there's been very little talk about
these systems so far so this is an
attempt to to shine that light onto evil
that is ongoing spying on citizens
spying on on host countries from
embassies spying in war zones on
civilian populations that we want to
uncover and the result of this
discussion that we've been having very
publicly was to GSM networks over the
past two years is hopefully that these
networks now implement protections
against what they perceive mostly as a
publicity threat because we're not
actually doing anything evil but we say
we could it is the ultimate convincing
argument that you can intercept the
phones of even the phone company's
executives so that ethical part of
hacking includes Bo's not really evil
but convincing everybody to to do to
counter in this case deploy technical
countermeasures or at least warn
customers that cellphones are not as
secure as as companies would like them
to be always have to say what would have
happened had we not done this but maybe
time coincidental maybe because of this
research networks are starting to
upgrade or have been upgraded these past
yes more more in newer networks that is
everywhere outside of the Western world
but also in Europe and hopefully the US
soon there
start drawing out countermeasures and
oftentimes they find that these
countermeasures are little more than
configuration changes software patches
things that are overdue for for many
years technology 20 years old that have
has been upgraded many times editing MMS
and fast internet connections and visual
voicemail and all these things but the
security hasn't been patched even once
same works for the t-mobile network here
same works against every network in
Europe right now pretty much every
network outside of Europe a few have
been patched now the most secure network
that we've seen recently was in Egypt
given that that it's now not just
defending our customers from ongoing
evil but also a possible publicity
threat here avoiding there's a lot to
gain for the networks and at the same
time it doesn't cost him very much
so it just took a few research years to
to create the information base for them
to act upon thanks very much Carson this
has been really interesting and very
cool what he showed us Thanks thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
