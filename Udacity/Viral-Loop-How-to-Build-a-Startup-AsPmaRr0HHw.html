all you do is you create demand on the
left side of the funnel and somebody
purchases on the right you could kind of
like measure how much it costs to do
that and we'll talk about customer
acquisition cost a little later but
there's a little magic accelerator on
the bottom of these funnels and that's
called the viral loop and a viral loop
could be something as simple as somebody
bought one of your products in the store
and could not wait to tell their friends
wow this was the greatest thing ever you
can't wait to get in boom
you now have kind of a magnifying effect
a viral effect about selling your
product based on users loving it that
has happened for hundreds of years but
now we could sometimes engineer this
viral loop by saying is there anything
we can do any incentives any ways to
kind of give rebates is there a way to
have turn our customers into sales
people to kind of accelerate this
purchase to help us get new customers
and smart startups think about this loop
all the time so viral loops are
something that startups want to see if
it's possible to create now just don't
feel bad if in your company it's really
not possible to do viral for example in
dating sites not everybody wants to
announce to their friends that they're
actually visiting a dating site so in
some cases it might not be possible but
in others you should always keep your
eye out is it possible to make this
funnel more efficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
