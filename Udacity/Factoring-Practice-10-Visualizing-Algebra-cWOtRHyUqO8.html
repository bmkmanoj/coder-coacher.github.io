answer is to a B times a minus 6 B times
a minus 8 b if you got it right well
done if you didn't get a right don't
worry we're going to go through it right
now remember the first thing that you
always want to do when factoring a
trinomial is to look for the GCF and
that is the most common mistake that
students make is they forget to factor
out the GCF if you don't factor out the
GCF first you make your life a lot more
difficult here when I look at these
three terms first of all I notice that
all three of the numbers are even and
two is the largest number so too is
going to be part of our GCF if i look at
the variables i have an a cubed and a
squared and an a so the lowest power of
a is to the first I have a bee B squared
+ b cubed so the lowest power of B is
just be when i factor out the GCF of 2a
be from a polynomial what am I left with
to a B times a squared gives me to a
cube be to a be x minus 14 a B to a B
times negative 14 a B gives me negative
28 a squared B squared + 2 x 48 gives me
96a I need a B squared so after i factor
out the GCF of to a B i'm left with a
squared minus 14 a B plus 48 b squared
now I need to factor this polynomial for
this polynomial since the coefficient of
the a squared term is 1 I need the
factors of 48 that add up to negative 14
since this is a positive number and this
is a negative number I know that both of
my factors are going to be negative a
negative times a negative is a positive
and a negative plus a negative gives me
a negative when I think of the number 48
there are several ways to factor the
number the two factors of positive 48
that add up to negative 14 is negative 6
times negative 8 so i can rewrite
negative 14 a be
as negative 6a be minus 8 a B now that i
have four terms i can factor by grouping
don't forget to carry down your GCF now
i need to look at the GCF of a squared
and negative 6a b which is simply a when
i factor an a out i'm left with a minus
6 B now I need to factor out the GCF of
the second two terms I know I want my
first term to be positive and my second
to be negative so I know I need to
factor out a negative the GCF of eight a
B and 48 b squared is going to be 8 B
what do i need to multiply 8 b by what
do i need to multiply a negative 8 b by
to get negative 8 a be just a and what
do i need to multiply negative 8 b by to
get positive 48 b squared negative 6 B
now the last step for factoring by
grouping here is to pull out the new GCF
which is a minus 6 b and what do I have
left over a minus 8 B that's how we got
the answer I know these problems aren't
easy but factoring is a key skill for
the whole rest of the course so it's
very important that you're able to
factor any polynomial to finish this
course so don't get discouraged it takes
a lot of practice keep up the good work
and don't worry you will master
factoring factoring is a key concept for
the rest of this course we will be using
factoring to solve many additional
problems throughout the rest of the
course so mastering factoring skills is
extremely important I know it's not easy
but the more you practice the better
you'll get and you will master factoring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
