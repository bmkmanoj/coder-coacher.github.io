is the maximum value that p can have and
the corresponding c value or the C value
at which that p value occurs well
remember what this curve looked like
overall it was a problem that opened
downward that means that the maximum
point here is just the vertex so that's
exactly what we want to find this see
value in p value that we're looking for
are just the coordinates of our vertex
let's get this in vertex form then so we
just need to go through our typical
process of completing the square to get
this equation in vertex form note that
I've actually skipped one step that I
included in the past when i subtract
this constant from both sides of the
equation I know that I'm doing that in
order to get the right side to equal our
perfect square in the past I've written
out what this entire polynomial is
multiplied out and then factored it as a
step after that but we don't really need
to do that the reason is that I already
know the factored form of the polynomial
that we're creating by adding this
before I even add on the constant term
the number that I'm adding to see this
negative 46 in this case is just the
coefficient of the seat of the first
term divided by 2 since that's the thing
that we're squaring in order to come up
with what we're adding to the end to
make this a perfect square so going
through all these steps gives us our
final equation of p minus 290,000 equals
negative 200 times the quantity C minus
46 squared from here we can read
straight off that our vertex must be at
46 290,000 so what does this tell us
well it tells us exactly the information
that we were looking for grant will earn
a maximum possible profit of two hundred

makes his wiper sets cost forty six
