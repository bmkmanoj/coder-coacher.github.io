particles by using the particle system
object the code here shows one way to
make some particles for the material we
load a disk texture that is transparent
around the edges using this texture and
particle basic material says to make a
billboard type of object that points
towards the camera in other words we
want to see this sprite texture always
facing towards us sitting size
attenuation to false means that we want
each particle to have a constant size on
the screen setting the size to 35 means
that we want the particle to beats 35
pixels wide the next bit is to make the
particle system object itself by using a
set of points in the particle material
by setting sort particles to true this
means we want the particles in the
system to be sorted with respect to the
cameras view this is important as
otherwise blending will not occur
properly when you have objects with
transparency you need to draw them in a
back-to-front order so that they combine
correctly the geometry object you pass
into a particle system is a list of
vertices in this example 8,000 particles
are being created and added to the scene
I randomly generate these vertices
within a box going from negative 1,000
two 1,000 in XY and Z and check that
each is inside a sphere of radius a
thousand if not I asked for another
random point there are more efficient
ways to generate random points in a
sphere but this is quick to remember in
code try the demo out if you dahling out
far enough you'll see the sphere formed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
