camera control the parameter with the
most obvious effect is the field of view
as mentioned before this value is the
angle from the bottom of the view
frustum to the top it also adjusts the
side to side angle factoring in the
aspect ratio the field of view parameter
acts something like a zoom lens as you
set this angle smaller and smaller
whatever's in the middle of the screen
grows larger and larger for these images
what I've done is have the field of view
match the camera move more or less in
other words as i zoom in on the model I
also move farther away so that the model
takes about the same amount of room on
the screen as we zoom out the
perspective distortion gets less and
less at the limit that is as we attempt
to go infinitely far away and have the
field of view approaching an angle of 0
degrees the view becomes an orthographic
projection if you're practically
infinitely far away everything you're
looking at is that essentially the same
distance as far as relative size goes
which is how the orthographic projection
treats the scene this effect of having
the field of view and the camera
movement offset each other has become a
go-to effect in cinematography if you
want to express something that's weird
or dreamlike happening in the scene you
zoom in while moving backwards at the
same time or vice versa give this demo
try yourself and see how it looks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
