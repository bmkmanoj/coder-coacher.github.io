we know to divide fractions we want to
multiply by the reciprocal so i can
rewrite this problem as a multiplication
problem as 24 / 35 times the reciprocal
of the second fraction which is 21 over
40 so instead of multiplying 24 x 21 and
trying to reduce that i can factor
before i multiply so 24 can be written
as 6 times 4 35 can be written as 7
times 5 21 can be written as 7 times 3
and 4 t can be written as 4 times 10
from here i notice that there's a seven
in my numerator and in my denominator
and we know 7 over 7 equals 1 and we
know that for over 4 is equal to 1 now
we can multiply the numerators together
6 times 3 is 18 and 5 times 10 is equal
to 50 whenever I do problems with
fractions i always want to make sure
that my final answer is in simplified
form so i need to see if 18 / 50 is
simplified well I notice right away that
18 is an even number and 50 is an even
number so they're both divisible by 2 so
i can write 18 as 9 times too and i can
write fifty as 25 times two now that i
have these in factored form i can cross
out to over to now we get to our final
answer which is nine over 25</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
