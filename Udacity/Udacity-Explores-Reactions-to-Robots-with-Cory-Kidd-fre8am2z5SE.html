reaction that you receive from patients
when they you know unbox their first
baby boo and kind of work with it in
their house well I think the reaction
starts like the reactions that we care
about start even before that okay so one
of the things that we think about is how
is this introduced to a patient it's not
like something this box shows up at the
doorstep right um I got a robot in here
right so the patient's going to be
introduced it was in some way right now
that's either through their pharmacy if
they're getting a certain prescription
that this might come with or in the near
future patients who are going to be
discharged from the hospital might be
getting one of these as well so a nurse
is going to be telling them about it
what's that language that we use right
then all right so how do we set up the
expectations in the right way and and
set up the the relationship that we want
this patient to have how they're going
to benefit from it in a way that they
believe that right they believe this is
a tool that is going to be useful for
them and something that they're going to
benefit from so the the initial thing
that we think about is what's what's the
language in that first conversation
who's going to be delivering it to them
right and what should they be saying how
do we talk about the benefits to a
patient before they ever even see this
thing so you know our patients get this
box at home and it's probably the first
time they perceive the robot in the mail
okay and so maybe at first is a little
bit of confusion so we try to make
things as clear as possible right when
they first open up the box is a little
one-page instruction sheet right and it
gives the whole long list of
instructions which is take it out of the
box and plug it in that's it right so
really simple and having a focus on
making this really easy for someone to
use is important given who we're
shipping these to right some of our
patients are going to be very tech savvy
and they got a couple of computers and
you know their Smart Watch on a cell
phone or - some of them we know of never
owned a computer right so it's of making
it so that anyone across this whole
spectrum can use this is important and I
plug it in and you know of course it's
essentially a computer or phone kind of
thing in here so it's going to take a
minute to boot up but as soon as it does
it looks at them right oh hey good to
see you thanks for taking me on
getting cramped in there and so we tried
to make a little bit humorous at first
and of course we're reading the emotion
on that person's face ideally like this
you may appreciate it or the dumbest
thing I've ever heard right we want to
know that so we can start adapting to
them right away and so it's important
for us to you know create some delight
in that person right away right so that
they like interacting with us and we
want to bring a smile to their face and
from there we go into more of the here's
why I'm here all right I'm here to help
you do you know with this condition that
you're dealing with or you know with
this drug that you're taking and so
making sure that you know in those first
few seconds and in the first few minutes
that we're really communicating to our
patients you know why this is something
of value to them and by focusing on
these things right so making sure this
is something that's a delightful
experience to start and showing me as a
patient why this has value to me we get
a very positive response from almost
everyone that we put these in front of
so one of our challenges over running
various trials over the last decade put
the first hand built version of this
that I put in front of patients back in
2007 to the early versions of maybe that
we've been putting in front of patients
now the challenge has been we give these
to patients for maybe it's half an hour
maybe it's a few days maybe it's a few
months at the end of it they won't give
them back to us so I think it's a great
challenge to have but it shows you what
kind of reception these do have with
patients who are using right and I think
that's a lot because you're focusing on
the underlying problem right so you're
really focused on the person at the end
of the day and that's technology itself
I know we kind of talked about this a
little bit earlier but it's really about
how do we help people in that how do we
build a cool robot right look at all the
bells and whistles as this has versus
look what I can actually do for somebody
exact based on what I've helped put
together right so we think about
robotics as an abling technology not as
an industry right we don't think of this
as a robotics company right the name of
the company is not you know to tell your
robotics work to try a health right
we're a health care company
roughly half a little under half of our
employees of a technical background
right we've also got nurses and
psychologists and doctors and writers
and you know overall we're solving a
healthcare problem the technology just
happens to help us do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
