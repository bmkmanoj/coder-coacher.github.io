multiplying through by 40 I'm going to
multiply the left by 40 and the right by
40 I've multiplied this side by 40 and
notice I didn't need to multiply these
inside terms because eventually this
will get distributed to each of them I
put parentheses around the right side
because I need to distribute the 40 to
both these terms
40 times 1/4 is 44 or 10 I know that
because 40 divided by 4 makes 10 this
also makes sense because I can think of
40 over 1 and then divide 40 and 4 both
by 4 and I'll get 10 over 1 or 10 now
I'm going to distribute or multiply this
10 into this inside parentheses I have
10 times negative 2/5 why here and I
have 10 times 1 here I can reduce a
common factor of 5 in the numerator and
the denominator so I get negative 4 over
1 or negative 4y and then I have my 10
on the end notice how both times I
reduced before I multiplied usually it's
easy to reduce common factors before you
multiply try doing that on this side if
you carry out the distribution on the
right side what terms would you get down
here be sure you enter a number and a
variable in the first box and a number
in the second box
you'll also want to include both of
their signs if the term is negative be
sure to type a negative sign in front of
your answer good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
