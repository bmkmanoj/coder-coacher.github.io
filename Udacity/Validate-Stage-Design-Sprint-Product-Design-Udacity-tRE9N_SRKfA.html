moving to the validation stage right
that's right the validation stage and
the hardest question in product design
the hardest question in product design
is how do you know if your work is any
good
okay that's important question it's very
important how we answer this question
has three different stages Google we use
something that we call triple validation
just like in the beginning we looked at
the problem from the perspective of
business technology and users at the end
we want validate the solution from the
same three touch points the most
important opinion and the most important
votes and validation is that of the
users so the critical piece not to miss
is the opportunity to test your
prototype with real users
we recommend sprinters and the Sprint
lead recruit users from the very
beginning of the Sprint so they know
that at the end the users are coming
right and they have to prepare for it
and else the all the efforts that they
have spend with prototyping could cost
waste because they don't actually know
it is he solving the knee of the user
self so meeting the users at the
beginning is useful to learn their needs
and meeting them at the end is crucial
in order to test this type of test is
called a usability test or cognitive
walkthrough it allows him to put the
product or the early prototype in the
hands of the user and watch them walk
through all the different all the
different stages what do they like where
do they get stuck do they understand
what the idea is about and is he talking
the needs that they have and did they
expressed early on
do I need to explain the user what what
he needs to do you know what we like to
do in this stage is that kind of like
it's based on one of the ideas of
writing show don't tell a great design
prototype should be able to stand on its
own without too much explaining
generally we'd like to set up the user
and say imagine you're shopping for a
new product or imagine you're looking to
write a review and now tell me what you
see
and now tell me what you're doing from
here
so we asked the users questions and
asked them to imagine themselves solving
a specific scenario and we watch what
they do we ask them questions to clarify
but we're not trying to sell the product
to them one of the mistakes that people
make in this stage is that they imagine
this is a marketing pitch and they start
explaining how awesome the product is or
why they love the idea this is a useful
approach if you're trying to recruit
that specific person to buy your product
and they might just because they're
trying to be nice but this approach does
not answer the critical question is the
product any goods that you force someone
in person to buy something is very
different from creating something that's
popular and that works on is that people
love that's right and our users the only
people I want to get in front of this
prototype
well the user validation is one of three
points in the rapid evaluation process
the other two points involve the
business and the technology it's really
useful to test with the stakeholders of
the team is that still meeting the
business goals
is this still answering the promises
that you made to investors or the goals
that you have as a company and if yes
fantastic and if no we need to go back
to the drawing board more often than not
teams are aligned with the business
goals and the stakeholders are happy
with the results but if you skip that
validation they might not approve the
design or block a little later stage so
you having a quick check-in with the
stakeholders even if they didn't end the
entire sprint can be very useful the
stage very cool another piece that's
important here is doing a technical
check a design solution that's beautiful
but no one can implement it's only so
valuable so what what we want to do is
encourage teams to check in with the
technical staff is this still going the
right direction in terms of feasibility
and if this seems challenging let's
clarify what are the pieces here that
seems like they're gonna tell you the
longest and how might we be able to
point the design in a way that's not
creating hurdles and something that we
can test and deliver quickly okay so
what I'm hearing is we need to do three
validations validate with users where it
is with business stakeholders and
validate with technology
people yeah these validations can be
rather quick or user tests can be twenty
to thirty minutes and you can test with
three or four or five different people
for most teams that even test with one
person is already a success the business
validation can be a five to ten minute
discussion or longer if the issue is
very problematic or the technical
validation can be similarly short five
to ten minutes we're doing this as the
best practice sort of like covering a
checklist to make sure that all the
possible ways in which something can
fail to deliver after this print are
addressed and they're also people bought
into the solution which makes it easier
to deliver afterwards so what could go
wrong in this stage that's a great
question what could go wrong is the
team's can be overly confident in their
own solution and skip the user testing
there is a common pattern that we see
with teams that are new to sprinting
they think oh we can do the user testing
later it is true that the user test can
be done separately from the Sprint but
that is a mess while the team is
together and they're fresh in the in the
in the space of the all the prototyping
is really valuable to write away get
feedback if you do the user test with
your whole team present and right after
the the creation session this gives the
need to write any research documents and
it keeps all the ideas fresh in their
mind that makes it that much more likely
that the products and the problems will
get addressed in the next phase and what
happens that they don't like the
solution that the users fadeth well if
the users head solution it's a great
opportunity to learn we try to be humble
with our designs after all we only spend
two to five days working on them we hope
that the life of the company will be
much longer than that so those two to
five days were valuable if you learned
something so if the users don't like
something it's a great time to seek to
understand again so we go back to the
first way of thinking which was let's
understand what is it that they don't
like is there something that could be
solved better asking questions and
probably probably in deeper into the
things that then
that users don't like it's a great
opportunity the best time to learn is
that users don't like something it's
right after you have created a prototype
into the five days and not after you can
spend two years of your life telling
everyone you love and maxing out your
credit card so in this stage we take the
users we look at we let them play with
the prototype and we listen to them
that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
