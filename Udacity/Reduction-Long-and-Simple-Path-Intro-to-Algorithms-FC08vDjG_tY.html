suggest there's probably a couple
different ways to do this we could take
the the original graph that we know
there is some length L path simple path
from u to V and what we can do is for
each edge in the graph say well what if
we delete that edge is there still a
path and if the answer is yes then we
just leave it delete it but if the
answer is no that we've now actually
broken the path from or a path or the
last path from u to V of length at least
a linji
then we need to leave it in there we
keep repeating this and until all the
edges have been considered and all
that's left at the end will be the
simple path why because if there's any
any edges in there that's not on the
simple path then we can delete it and
where there still is a simple path and
certainly we can't delete any of the
ones on that simple path and still have
it work so we what's left is exactly
what we need so here is here's my
attempt at that as Python code so again
we check first to make sure that there
really is such a path and if there isn't
then we just quit before we try to find
it but if there is so somewhere in there
the path exists what we're going to do
is run through all the edges so node 1
and G look at all the neighbors look at
node 2 which is a neighbor of node 1
so now node 1 node 2 is is an edge in
the graph and we're going to break the
link I probably should have mentioned
that earlier but there is actually a
break the link piece of code in the
skeleton that I gave you
so from in graph G get rid of the edge
from node 1 to node 2 we can do that in
constant time and now we ask is it the
case that there's still a long and
simple decision how long a simple path
we ask for the decision is there a long
and simple path in G from u to V of
length L and if the answer is no if
there's not such a path then we need to
put that edge back in the graph
otherwise we just leave it out we repeat
this for all the nodes all the edges and
then and then we're basically done all
that's left in G is exactly the simple
path and now we have to read it out
it's a little bit messier than then I
thought it would be but it's definitely
doable you could run that as a graph
search on this graph and that would work
because all that's left is the path that
you want but another way to do it that's
more specific to this case is we start
off building our path from you we're
gonna have a variable node which is a
pretty kind of point in the in the chain
and a variable next which is a next
point in that chain and we start that
off with whatever is the neighbor of you
notice there can only be one neighbor of
you because all that's left is the
simple path from u to V but okay alright
so now we say as long as that next node
that we're looking for isn't V we append
next to the path so far so we have the
first two steps and now we're at a new
node this node next is going to have two
neighbors one is going to be the node we
just came from node and the other one is
going to be a new node that we haven't
considered yet so to figure out which
one it is and what I did is I just
pulled the two of them off I said let
next next zero be one of those neighbors
and next next one be the other if next
next zero is the node we just came from
then we're gonna move one step along the
chain node gets next and next gets next
next one the one that we haven't visited
and otherwise next gets next next zero
the one we haven't visited when that
loop is all through then next is V the
very last step on the path and we just
add that into our path and return it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
