into programming is why this makes any
sense
suppose you fill the matrix which I call
Omega and the vector which I give the
Greek name of C my apologies to my
non-greek students here your Greek
students will be very proud
you'll save a special place in my
mathematical heart then I can find the
best solution for all the landmark
position or the world position by a very
simple mathematical trick and that is
completely counterintuitive I invert the
Omega I write multiply with C and out
comes a vector mu which gives me the
best estimates for all the robot
locations and the landmark locations now
that is quite amazing because all it
means in graph slam is did you keep
adding numbers to these matrices every
time you see constraint and when you're
done with it you run a very simple
procedure in outcomes
the best places for your robot so let's
go and try it I'm not going to ask you
to program this and I'm giving you my
matrix class so you can do this easily
what am I asking you to do is to build a
3x3 matrix and of course a three by one
vector by which your shell state that
initial location is minus 3x1
and exploitation is obtained by adding 5
to x0 and x2 is obtained by adding 3 to
x1 so expectation what we should get out
we run the MU equals Omega minus 1 times
C trick that x0 becomes minus 3 X 1
becomes 2 and x2 becomes 5 so diving
straight into our programming
environment I'm giving you a matrix
class you might want to take a moment to
look over it it's little documented to
what I given you before and I fixed a
bug with the inversion code quite
essential and if I run it I construct an
Omega matrix piece by piece that's the
one that you should come out with X C
vector and then I run and print out
using the show command the result of
Omega to the minus 1 times C and you can
see minus 3 2 &amp;amp; 5 are the correct result
the result from the Omega matrix
see vector so what I want you to do is
write code that incrementally
step-by-step constructs the Omega vector
and the Z function and then returns to
me those results over here there's an
empty function in your code that accepts
as parameter the initial position minus
3 and the demotion values 5 and fie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
