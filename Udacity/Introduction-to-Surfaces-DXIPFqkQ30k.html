to be composed of pieces of digital
paper which we call surfaces now these
surfaces have tangible attributes to
imply real-world behaviors but they
aren't limited like the real-world
equivalents everything on the screen
lives in one of these surfaces including
all text icons photos buttons any UI
element really now these surfaces have a
tiny amount of physicality just enough
to show that one thing is distinct from
another and how they set relative to one
another
this taps into our instinctive ability
to quickly recognize objects there's no
need to take the metaphor too far and
use real world textures scenes specular
highlights or so on just the smallest
set of real-world cues are enough to
express a lot of meaning surfaces also
exist in 3d space where varying widths
and Heights and at different elevations
these surfaces are arranged in front of
and behind one another and cast shadows
on lower surfaces so here we can see as
the fab raises up in elevation it casts
a more diffuse shadow let's take a small
detour and really focus in about how and
why shadows get cast by surfaces in
general objects that are closer to us
command more of our visual attention and
we can tell which objects are closer
based on their size and how they cover
and cast shadows on the things that are
behind them so we can use depth as a cue
in our UI to direct attention to
important elements so how do we use
these concepts on a 2d screen we use the
shadows to convey surfaces elevation
relative to other surfaces surfaces near
to you will cast a larger shadow there's
a lot of complicated math behind how to
draw these shadows correctly but luckily
on Android we only have to edit a bit of
code and have the shadows drawn
dynamically for us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
