in software engineering and I will
stress this concept over and over
throughout the class and today we're
going to talk about a tool that is
especially important which is integrated
development environments or IDs and
you're probably familiar with IDs so IDR
environments that give you support that
for your development activities for
example for writing code editing code
compiling code and so on and we will
focus specifically on one particular ID
which is called Eclipse and what I'm
showing here is the two splash screens
for two versions of Eclipse heylia's and
Kepler Eclipse is an open extensible
development environment that was
initially created by IBM and is now
managed by the Eclipse Foundation and of
course there are many other great ideas
such as for example Microsoft Visual
Studio or NetBeans we will be using
Eclipse because it is open and because
it is multi-platform which means that
you can use Eclipse no matter what
operating system were using so if we
consider the most commonly used
operating system such as Mac OS Windows
Linux Eclipse runs on any of these
environments there are four no matter
what you're using you will be able to
install Eclipse run Eclipse and follow
