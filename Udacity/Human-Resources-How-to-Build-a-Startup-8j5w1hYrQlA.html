sometimes use a fancy word of human
resources or HR and I kind of think of
people in a start-up as two separate
categories one is finding qualified
employees and the other is for you the
founder how do you find mentors or
teachers or coaches and/or advisors for
you and what's the difference between
all of those well let me start with the
last first mentors teachers and coaches
it advanced your personal career if you
want to learn a specific subject you
find a teacher but if you want to hone
specific skills or reach an exact goal
I suggest you hire a coach that is a
specific subject as a teacher specific
skills is a coach so for example if you
want to learn something more about large
metadata architectures you could bring
in a teacher or take a class but if you
want to hone specific skills like how to
give a great presentation or how to
manage people you hire a coach but the
one that sometimes founders forget is if
you want to get smarter and better over
your career you want to find someone who
cares enough about you to be a mentor
and mentors are very different than
teachers or coaches mentors are actually
a two-way street
the only people who tend to want to help
you are those who implicitly think they
could actually learn something from you
in addition to liking you so most of you
in your career will actually go on to be
mentors but think about the type of
people who you've encountered in your
career implicitly you've been giving
something to them or they've been giving
something to you the last category in
mentors coaches teachers are advisers
now advisers are people you need to help
advance your company's success mentors
teachers and coaches or about your
personal success as a founder but
advisers really kind of bring generic
advice sometimes to you but also to your
VPS and your staff etc so what you want
to have is experienced advice to help
you figure out whether your vision is a
hallucination but getting specific you
want to put together as early as
possible an advisory board and that's
really the idea of
expanding your circle of accumulated
wisdom past just your investors a
mistake that founders make the first
time is thinking that their venture
capitalists or their angel investors are
your advisory board yes they're your
advisors but they're also your boss and
so you want to be very careful about
limiting your advice to just that circle
and they may not have the specific
domain expertise you need so make sure
you're expanding your series of advisors
available to your company and typically
that's done by offering them a small
percentage of equity in exchange for
some of their time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
