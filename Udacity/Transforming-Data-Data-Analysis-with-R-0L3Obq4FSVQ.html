on one output plot and to do that you
need to install the grid extra package
and load it into our studio once you've
got that now it's just a matter of
creating each of the three histograms
and saving them to three variables I'll
use p1 p2 and p3 for each of the plots
that I'm going to create now the first
histogram is the same as before we just
have friend count passed to X and P f
passed to data for the second histogram
we'll take the log 10 a friend count and
remember to add 1 to it first so that we
don't get any undefined results and
finally for our third histogram we'll
simply take the square root of friend
count now if I run all these lines of
code I can see that I create 3 new
variables that saves each of my plots
and now I just need to pass each of
these plots to grid data range and set
incall equal to 1 since I just want one
column with all my histograms and
running my code I can see that I get all
three histograms and here's a closer
view of the 3 notice that our second
plot is much better since we have a
normal list of distribution the square
root transform is also better than no
transformation at all since we don't
have as much of a long tail we do still
have a long tail it's just that much
lower friend counts since we transform
the variable the tail is just not as bad
as before now there was another way to
create these same three histograms using
a different type of syntax now the
syntax is a little bit more complicated
at first but I want to give you a
preview of it now since you'll see it in
upcoming lessons this time we're going
to use the ggplot syntax to create our
histogram ggplot is very similar to the
Q plot function since it still takes the
same parameters X and data the key
difference is that we need to include
any X or Y variables inside this
aesthetic wrapper or AES the other thing
we need to do is we need to tell ggplot
what type of plot we want to create or
what kind of genome we want the genome
that we want is genome histogram running
this bit of code I can see that I get my
original histogram which is the first
one we created on friend count running
the entire line I can save this
histogram into p1 now I've got a plot
that I can just alter using scales so
for the second plot I'm going to take my
first plot and just add a scale X log 10
to it this is going to transform the x
axis or the X variable using log
ten similarly for the third graph I'm
going to add scale X square root now I
don't want to use P two here since I've
already got a scale log ten on it I want
to use my original graph P one and add
scale X square root now saving all these
plots and writing our grid arrange
function we get the same output as we
had before now there is a slight
difference here at based on the x axis
labeling and I want you to see if you
can figure that out if you're not sure
the difference is don't worry I'll
explain it in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
