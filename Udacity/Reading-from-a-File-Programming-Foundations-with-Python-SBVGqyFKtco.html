will start with step 1 which is reading
text now here is the file I want to
check for curse words for now I have
some famous movie quotes in here by the
way this file could have contained some
other text like the draft of an email or
an article you note I have named this
file movie coach dot txt now if you want
to use this exact file in this program
it is available for you to download in
the instructor notes but you should feel
free to use any other text file on your
computer as well ok let's start writing
code now I created a program called
check profanity dot py you could have
called it something else as well inside
it I created a function called read text
which is empty for now now I know there
is this function in Python called
open which allows you to work with files
on your computer this function takes in
the address or the location of the file
you want to open so on a Windows machine
I will browse to my file which is movie
underscore coates dot txt copy its
location place that and then add the
file name I want to open which is movies
underscore codes dot txt now if you're
on a Mac there is a helpful document in
the instructor notes for you that
document will tell you how to get the
location of this file on a Mac I will
refer to this file as Coates now that I
have a way of accessing movie codes dot
txt I will use a function called read so
I will say codes that read this will
allow me to read the contents of movie
codes so let me save that in a variable
called contents of file let me print out
those contents and it's also a good
convention to close out any file that
we've opened through the program ok now
I'm going to save and run this program
and see where it gets us and boom here's
our output window with all of the movie
codes that we had read from the text
file now I don't know about you but it
just blows my mind that we can read from
a text file with only a few lines of
code
okay so I'm back at our program now
before I continue to execute anymore of
our plan let's find out a bit more about
this function called open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
