with debugging suppose someone asks you
to write a su doku checker su doku is a
common pencil and paper game also often
seen on the computer in which you fill
in grids with numbers according to
certain rules if you haven't seen su
doku before it doesn't matter we're not
going to do false todoku we're going to
do a very simple subset of it people
would normally write out these almost
tic-tac-toe like boards we will
represent that as a list of lists so our
first row is the list 1 2 3 our next row
is the list 4 5 6 and our last row is
the list seven eight nine and what I
want to do is just check that
horizontally all the numbers are
different so this is good because one is
different from two which is different
from three this is good four five and
six are all not equal this is good seven
eight and nine are all not equal but
this makes me super sad because I've
reused one this is our horizontal su
doku checker i'm going to write one with
a bug and you're going to help me fix it
so here I've written out our horizontal
su doku checker but I'm going to do it
probably a little differently than you
might have in the past I'm going to use
a more complicated algorithm to make it
a little harder to debug to give you a
feel for how this might go in the real
world I've written a helper procedure
called count given a number in a row a
row is just a list it returns the number
of times that number appears wha-ho
that's ambiguous so if for example
you're asking for five it occurs once in
one two three four five but it's count
is now two in one two three four five
five and I'm doing this using reduce
from functional programming I'm
intentionally throwing in lambda pythons
equivalent of Java scripts function
expression reduce and map and list
comprehension are aspects of functional
programming used by companies like
Google to make their search engines
faster and more parallelizable what this
does is starting with the number zero
I'm going to go over every element in
the row and I'm going to call the
current element this and I'm going to
call what I have so far the accumulator
if the current element is equal to the
number that i want i'll return 1 plus
the accumulator otherwise I'll just
return the accumulator let me walk you
through it on checking the new count of
five in one two three four five the
number that we want is five the current
element start
out at one so I'm going to leave the
accumulator alone next the current
element is too that's not five so I
leave the current accumulator alone next
the current element is three that's
still not five so I leave the
accumulator alone next to the current
element is four still not five I leave
the accumulator alone then the current
element is 50 happy day in jubilation i
turn the accumulator into 1 plus the
accumulator so just one and then in this
particular list there's actually another
five right after that so this is 5 again
so I'll have 1 plus 1 which becomes too
so I'm walking down this list how many
fives if I seen zero zero zero zero one
two great you could have written this
with a simple for loop without using
reduce but often when you have to debug
a program it's after you've been away
for a while and it looks a bit
unfamiliar so I'm intentionally giving
you code that's not your usual style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
