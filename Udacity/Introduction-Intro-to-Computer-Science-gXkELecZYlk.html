little different from previous units
we're gonna start in right away by
finish the code for our web search
engine what we've built so far is a web
crawler it can follow content on web
pages following links to find other
pages but it doesn't actually respond to
queries what we're going to build in
this unit is a search engine where we
can pass in a keyword and get a list of
the pages that contain that keyword
we're also going to learn more about how
the internet works and the world wide
web the main new computer science idea
in this unit is the idea of how to use
and build complex data structures in
order to respond to queries quickly we
want to be able to have a data structure
where we can look up a keyword and
quickly find the pages that match that
keyword without needing to scan all the
pages every time to do this we're going
to build a structure called an inverted
index or often just an index that allows
us to have a mapping between keywords
and pages that contain those keywords
our index is really the same idea as an
index in a book I happen to have a book
handy it's one of my favorites I may be
a little biased since I read it but
let's take a look and see if there's
anything in the book that would help us
understand indexed searching we could
try to read the whole book see if there
was anything about index search in here
or we could go to the index and if we're
lucky the index will have what we have
it's got index search as each keyword in
the index it has the page number so we
would go to the page number where that's
found and instead of needing to read the
whole book to try to find what we're
looking for if we can find the right
page we'll find the section an index
search right away so that's the goal of
an index for our search engine what we
want is an index that provides a mapping
from keywords to the list of webpages
where that keyword appears</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
