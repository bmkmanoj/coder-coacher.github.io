can easily say that independent set is
np-complete because we can transform a
graph for which you want to solve click
easily into a graph for on which you can
solve independent set and then that will
give you a solution for click so we
already have that reduction down here
which of course which of course will
make Carol quite unhappy and we also add
the reduction from independent set to
vertex cover because we showed that
solving vertex cover on the graph is
basically the same thing as solving
independent set so vertex covers also
np-complete so alice is now unhappy as
well and what this means is the
following the problems that Alice Bob
and Carol are trying to solve are as
hard as any problem in NP can become any
problem that you could solve in
polynomial time if you have had this
magic if better function available would
also be solvable in polynomial time if
we found a polynomial time algorithm for
any of their problems or even in other
words if you found a polynomial time
algorithm for vertex cover independent
set click or sat what this would mean is
that you have found a way to simulate
the if-better function in polynomial
time you can simulate a
non-deterministic Ram on a deterministic
Ram in polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
