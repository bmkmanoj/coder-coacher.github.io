you do integer division in Python 2.7
say 3/2 that evaluates to 1 and 1/2
evaluates to 0 and the reason is in
their wisdom the designers of Python
says well if you're doing integer
division you probably want an integer
answer and we'll do the best we can and
we have to truncate to give you the
answer in Python 3 the designers decided
well that's really confusing what you
really want when you divide 3 over 2 is
1.5 and when you divide one over to you
want Oh point 5 and that's what Python 3
does so it says let's change the result
from an integer to a floating point
number if that's the best you can do now
if you want this kind of behavior in
Python 2 then you say from the future
with the two underscores on either side
of it import division and I want that
because in my crypt arithmetic problems
I really prefer this type of answer and
not that type of answer so now I'm done
and I got a pretty concise program it
followed my plan very nice and easily I
like this design of the three pieces
that I've tried to divide it up into
look how simple this all function is it
just says iterate over all possible ways
of filling it in ask if it's valid and
if it is returned can't get much more
clear than that valid is pretty simple
it's valid it's almost like asking is
eval f true if it were that simple I
would just put it in line up here but
it's not quite that simple i need the
try and I'm pick step than they need to
catch the earth Medicare and then
there's this little trick with the
leading 0 digits so I like having a
separate function for valid to break
that out and then I like having fill in
as a generator to make the logic of the
main function simple but not too slow me
down by requiring me to generate all the
possible answers at once the generator
comes up with the
one at a time so it's separating out the
flow of control from the logic now am I
done at this point well no because what
I have to do next is convince myself
that I've got it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
