testing and here we're asking a
different question than we're asking
with integration testing and unit
testing here we're asking the question
does the system as a whole
meet its goals and often at this point
we're doing blackbox testing and that's
for a couple of reasons
first of all the system is probably
large enough by now that a detailed
knowledge of its internals may not be
very much help in creating good test
cases the second reason is really at
this point we're not so much concerned
with what's going on inside the system
as with whether the system actually
meets its goals or not and so another
thing that differentiates system testing
from unit testing is the fact that at
this level we are often concerned with
how the system will be used and
effectives at this level we may not care
about making the system work for all
possible use cases rather we would
simply like to make sure that it
performs acceptable e for the important
use cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
