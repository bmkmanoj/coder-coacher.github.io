into the social thing but I want to make
this thing mobile all right you promise
me that I can you already did so I have
this thing called an iOS simulator and
it lets me show you what this would look
like on my phone
sweet and right now it's not that
impressive it looks like a crappy
website on an iPhone what is this a
website for ants and that's bad
the main 10 ads maybe oh I can zoom in
but still this is kind of you know not
that impressive so what can I do
all right so you could install an app
right off you know the App Store into
your phone or you could just navigate to
a new URL that'll pull up all of this
data and all of your applications in a
mobile web app okay so what is this
mystery URL salesforce1 yo okay all
right so don't delete everything just at
the end of this URL will delete
everything back to you com so just keep
going back nothing yep and then there
you go and then / 1 / 1 dot app w I mean
no any yep yep yep
oh man that is cool alright so first
what we're looking at right now is
that's our chatter feed okay but this
whole thing is pulling up salesforce1
would you like sorry you're gonna like
your own post yeah Wow it's okay it's
socially acceptable in the corporate
world okay all right but what this is is
it's a mobile representation of all of
your Salesforce data in one application
and so maybe you didn't realize this the
whole time we were going through all of
our app building but you've
simultaneously built a mobile app that's
completely functional with everything
that you've already done and you can see
its surface in them yeah that is really
cool
so let me poke around a bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
