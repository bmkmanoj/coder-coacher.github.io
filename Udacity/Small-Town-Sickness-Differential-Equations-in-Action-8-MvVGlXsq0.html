day and person let's do the computation
let's look at the given data what do we
know about each infected person as every
other person each infected person will
meet 25 persons per day only susceptible
persons can be infected so the question
is how many susceptible persons are
among these 25 we can compute that by
ratio if they are 1,000 people in total
then the ratio of the number of
susceptible persons divided by the total
of 1,000 persons times these 25 persons
will be susceptible imagine everybody
was susceptible then we would compute
1000% times 25 all 25 would be
susceptible if every second person was
susceptible 500 / 1000 results in
one-half x 25 where every second person
would be susceptible so this is the
number of contacts between a single
infected person and susceptible persons
per day and each of these contacts will
lead to infection with the probability
of 2% so now we can compute how many
persons are infected by the single
infected person per day this is the
number of contacts with susceptible
persons per day we multiply with the
probability this will be the number of
new infections per day we can cancel the
person's these three numbers combine two
point or five per day and / infected
person and that's precisely the
expression we are needing in the SI our
equations constant times the number of
susceptible persons times the number of
infected persons but keep in mind that
we are dealing with average values here
25 persons per day give or take a
probability of 2% things can occur more
often or less often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
