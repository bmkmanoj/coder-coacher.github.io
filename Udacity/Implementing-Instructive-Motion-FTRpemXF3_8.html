motion might look like in this example
we have a full-bleed image and some
content below it there's a tension here
we want to show the image in full but we
also want to indicate that there's more
text available and perhaps we want to
show some of that text content right
away too
what we can do is start off with the
image fully visible but then immediately
slide up some of the text to indicate
there's more content let's see how we
can implement this pretty simple form of
instructive motion let's start with the
layout nothing fancy here just a frame
layout with a fixed height image in a
scroll view in front of it the linear
layout in the scroll view will contain
our text content and have a white
background
we'll give the linear layout a little
elevation to make it clear that it's a
distinct surface now at the default
scroll position you see the full image
but very little text content all we need
to do is animate the scroll position as
the screen first opens to a position
that shows more of the text content here
we're using an object animator to
animate the scroll Y property of the
scroll view we could just use the scroll
views smooth scroll to method but this
gives you a bit more control over that
animation we start the animation inside
of on enter animation complete to ensure
that the window transition ends first
before we start the animation this is
only available in Android 5.0 and later
but you could fake it on earlier
versions using something like a start
delay the effect is that you get a quick
preview of the image before you start
reading about it and you quickly realize
you could scroll up to see that image in
full again or down to read more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
