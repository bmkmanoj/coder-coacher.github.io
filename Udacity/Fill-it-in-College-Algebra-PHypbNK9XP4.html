table you'll notice that we did end up
with one spot in this far right column
where we had to write undefined and that
was where x equals 4 we set X equal to 4
the denominator here becomes 0 and since
we know that division by zero is not
allowed it's not something we can
interpret using our algebra skills we
have to write undefined in this box it
makes the entire fraction the entire
rational expression undefined rasm we
are dealing with quadratic inequalities
we were multiplying two factors together
now we're dividing them but what's
interesting to note is that we have the
same relationship between signs of the
first two columns in the sign of the
third column for dividing two negative
numbers we get a positive number we're
dividing a negative by a positive or the
rivers a positive and negative we get a
negative number and if we're dividing
two positive numbers we get a positive
of course zero is the exception 0
divided by any number regardless a
positive or negative is 0 and any number
whether positive or negative divided by
0 it's going to give us an undefined
