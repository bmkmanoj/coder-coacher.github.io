scientists do I think it's it's really
hard to pinpoint exactly what they do
because it's going to be a tailor to the
actual application area where they work
but in general what they do is they take
data and they find meaning in the data
and what the meaning is going to be
really geared towards is going to be the
case for for what they would like to
explain so it could be that a particular
company if they are working at a company
or they project if they are looking for
some some particular signal in something
but in general in my mind what data
science does is is use is uses data and
data sizes uses data to essentially
explain and perhaps predict behavior a
bit human behavior or even like like
behavior of our more machine generated
system anything could be like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
