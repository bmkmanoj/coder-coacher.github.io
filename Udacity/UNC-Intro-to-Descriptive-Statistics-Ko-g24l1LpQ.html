seen that the average salary of
geography majors is about 48,000 however
in the mid-1980s the average starting
salary of geography students at the
University of North Carolina was well
over 100,000 why was this
well maybe UNC had a really good
geography program or maybe UNC's career
services program found top tier jobs for
students or maybe salaries in North
Carolina were just higher in the 1980s
actually it's because Michael Jordan
graduated from there and his starting
salary was over $500,000 so you saw that
the mode isn't influenced by an outlier
at all but the mean is influenced a lot
we need something in between this is
where the median comes in which is the
middle of the data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
