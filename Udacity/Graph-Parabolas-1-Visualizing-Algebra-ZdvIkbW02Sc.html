great work if you found this we start by
completing the square we want to add a
certain amount in order to make this a
perfect square we'll need to add 4 in
order to do that and since we add 4 here
let's also subtract for this keeps our
equation balanced remember that to
complete the square here we always add B
over 2 squared the B value is negative 4
so B over 2 is negative 2 and that
amount squared is positive 4 it's the
amount we add in order to complete our
square now we're ready to write this
expression as a perfect square the
positive 5 and negative 4 will just stay
on the end here's our perfect square and
here's our equation simplified combining
these two numbers so the vertex is at
positive 24 the x-coordinate and
positive one for the y coordinate our
vertex is here and we get it by setting
this binomial equal to 0 and the k value
or the y coordinate of the vertex is K
it's right here positive 1 now that we
have our vertex we could actually plot
two other points the ones right next to
the vertex our a value is positive 1 so
this means we move one unit left and
right of the vertex and then one unit up
vertically that will give us two
additional points and if we zoom in on
our parabola we can see this more
clearly we move left one and write one
from the vertex and then we move a units
in the vertical direction in this case
one unit up so left one and up one and
right one and up one this gives us our
points at 1 comma 2 and 3 comma 2 once
we have these two points we can draw in
the basic shape of our parabola that's
how we get this graph</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
