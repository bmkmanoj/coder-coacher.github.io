today it's called template inheritance
now we can make this quite complex but
for our purposes we're just gonna do
this simple thing that'll make our
templates much easier to use if you
notice on a web page let's draw one most
web pages have you know a title and a
footer and then they have some content
in the middle you know this might be the
page slash and then you might have
another page that looks identical you
know maybe this is the slash like about
page it also has a title it also has a
footer the same title in the same footer
and have some different content when
you're generating HTML you don't want to
have to generate the you know write the
same title and the same footer over and
over again just like in your code when
you use functions and classes to better
organize your code so you don't have to
write the same piece of code over and
over again you can organize your
templates in the same way and that's
what I want to talk about right now you
can use template inheritance so you can
have one template that includes the
header and the footer and then you can
have a bunch of sub templates that use
that just that redefine the content in
the middle so here's how we're gonna
organize our code now so here's what we
have right now in our code we have
shopping list about HTML and we have
fizzbuzz that HTML and these files don't
have anything in common but we want to
give we want to add a little title to
this page we're gonna make each of these
inherit from base HTML and we're gonna
make each of these inherit from base
HTML and base HTML is going to have some
common HTML that these two templates
will share to make them match a little
better and I'll just go ahead and show
you an example of how to do this so
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make a new file called base HTML I'm
gonna go ahead and put in it things I
want these files to have in common and
I'm also going to do a proper HTML
document this time umm I saved at its
base HTML now remember
HTML documents start with a doctype and
then we have the HTML tag and then we
have the head and within the head we can
have the title and so both of our pages
will share this title within that or
within HTML we have body now I'm gonna
add a new syntax here ok so then we have
our we have our body open and close and
then we close our HTML this is the basic
structure of an HTML document and it's
what goes inside body that makes
Paige neat know what to change our title
to while we're at it but let's just
worry about the body and Jinja the
syntax that we can use will look
something like this the syntax for
creating a black and a black is
something that'll be shared amongst
templates you just say squiggle % block
and then you give the block a name in
this case we're gonna call it content
and then you can say n block and we can
make each of our templates use this
block of content so let's show how we
would use this base HTML in shopping
list at the top of shopping list I'm
going to say let's add some code to our
body that all of our templates are going
to have in common
I'm gonna add a little a header across
the top ok so I've just added a little
title that we're gonna put across the
top of our page it's just in h1 and I
give it a little extra styling this is
CSS
we gave it a background color of DDD and
a foreground color of 888 this is kind
of gray with slightly darker gray on top
of it I got rid of its March and then I
gave it a height of 50 pixels also I'm
going to add a little style to the body
this will make it layout a little bit
nicer margin zero okay so let's go ahead
and use this template in our shopping
list the syntax for this is quite simple
all we do is at the top of our file you
say extends based on HTML this this
tells this template that we're gonna be
a part of based at HTML now let's see
what this does in practice we're sure
everything is saved nothing here has
changed and our main handler we're still
rendering shopping list HTML let's go to
our front page okay it's still quite a
mess here let's reload this once I
reloaded we can see that the header that
I wrote is here with the kind of grey on
grey background but none of our content
is here let's look at the source for
this okay we basically see this is our
base at HTML file but we're not seeing
any of that content because that was in
that block content and we didn't
overwrite that so let's go ahead and
take a look at our templates again this
is our base HTML this is basically what
we were seeing as the source in our
browser but our shopping list said HTML
hasn't actually filled in this content
yet let's see how we do that all you do
is hear you say block content and this
this line here block and then the name
content matches this line here and base
that each team
and they put a closing one at the bottom
and block we save this file and we go
back to our browser and when I reload
this page we see all of our stuff down
here now within our base HTML template
and when we view this source we can see
we have the base HTML header then we can
see we have our form content here in the
middle and then we can have the down
here there's it's hard to see because of
the scrolling but the end of the basic
HTML template so that's pretty handy
right this allows us to separate the
content of our pages and the templates
for that content from the surrounding
content that all of our other pages
might have in common and I use this a
lot in this um in this course especially
during the blog and and some of the
other things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
