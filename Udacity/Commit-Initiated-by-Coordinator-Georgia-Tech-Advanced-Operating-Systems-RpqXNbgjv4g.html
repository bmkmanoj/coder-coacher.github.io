resulted in this formation of a
transaction tree completes its action
for example let's say that the
transaction tree got created as a result
of a client opening a file doing a bunch
of reads of the file rights of the file
and finally closes the file at that
point that interaction between the
client and the server is complete that's
when the transaction tree that has been
created as a shadow of the original
clients of a relationship will get into
gear and say okay now it is time to
clean up any resources that may have
been partially created in order to
satisfy that original client-server
relationship and it is the coordinator
that initiates the termination of a
transaction and the termination
initiated by the coordinator can be four
commits or it can be an abort and the
different color-coded arrows show you
what are all the kinds of commands that
the coordinator may issue to its
subordinates who in turn will issue the
same commands to their subordinates if
the transaction manager the coordinator
decides that it is time to commit it
might ask for vote request on committee
or it might ask for an abort request or
it might send an end of commit or abort
these are all the communications that
would be initiated by the coordinator of
the transaction and correspondingly
responses will come back up the tree
commensurate with the request that was
given so using again the file service as
an example if a client that started a
file service request crashed for some
reason then the transaction manager that
is a coordinator for that client-server
relationship will then send an abort
request to all the participating
transaction managers that got touched by
that particular client as a result of
that file service request for instance
it could be a directory manager it could
be data servers that are hosting those
files and so on all of those transaction
managers will get contacted by the
coordinator through
transaction tree with a request to abort
that particular transaction ID and when
they get that request these transaction
managers can do local cleanup whatever
that might mean and indicate to the
transaction manager by response that yes
we have done what it needs to be done to
clean up the interaction that was
started by that failed IPC chain all the
different kinds of communication that
I've indicated here are opportunities to
tailor the commit protocols depending on
the criticality of the states that is
the nature of the breadcrumbs that are
going to be left behind in the different
servers so for instance if the
transaction tree is representing a
client-server relationship between a
client that opened a window using the
window manager on the screen then if the
client crashes then the transaction
manager who was the coordinator for that
particular client will indicate to the
transaction manager at that window
managers site that this particular
transaction ID is aborting and in that
case the window manager can simply clean
up the state because the state that it
is god is a volatile state namely a
window that had created on behalf of the
client so it can take care of it
internally it need not be persistent on
the other hand if the interaction that
we are talking about involves persistent
data structures for instance through a
file server then the file server may
have to take more complicated action so
that is what this transaction tree
allows you to do depending on the nature
of the client-server relationship you
can choose to use different commit
protocols depending on the criticality
of the states that are associated and
the nature of the breadcrumbs that may
have been left behind in the different
sites because of the client-server
relationships persistent servers such as
a file system many the sophisticated
commit processing such as a two-phase
commit protocol while a window manager
may only need a simple one phase commit
protocol so all of those are possible
was the structure of the transaction
tree and the kinds of requests that
flows through the
action tree both down the tree and up
the tree in response and this is the
heavy lifting that is done by the
operating system in order to support
different classes of services that might
exist in the operating system which may
require different recovery management</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
