use is Amdahl's law which we need to use
when we are about to speed up only part
of the program only some instructions
and so on
so basically when we have a speed up but
it doesn't apply to the entire program
and we want to know what is the overall
speed-up on the entire program
so the overall speed-up can be computed
as 1 over 1 minus the fraction of the
program we didn't enhance so for example
if we sped up 40 percent of the program
then this would be 60 percent plus the
fraction of the program we did enhance
in this case the 40 percent divided by
the speed up we achieve on that
enhancement how did we get there
so the speed-up in this case is the
improvement in performance which is 1
over the new execution time relative to
the old so this is the part that we
didn't improve just stays there the part
that we did improve is shorter by the
amount of improvement on that part it's
very very very important to understand
that the fraction enhanced here is a
percentage of the original execution
time that is affected by our enhancement
okay so it needs to be that 40% of the
time spent on the program is affected by
our speed not for example 40 percent of
the instructions in the program or
something else other than the time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
