help complete our interpreter to fill
out what it means to evaluate statements
previously we had an evaluate expression
function now I'm going to make a new
function for evaluating statements it's
going to take the abstract syntax tree
and also the environment we need to know
the values of variables as always by
convention we can get the type of the
thing we're looking for from the zeroth
part of the tuple we did all this work
in the parser to record it let's totally
take advantage of that one possibility
is that it's an assignment statement
those look something like this here's
our statement type assignment and its
first argument or the first part of its
tuple is going to be some variable name
that we're assigning to and then the
second part is going to be an arbitrary
expression abstract syntax tree so that
corresponds to X becomes 3 so I'll just
get out the variable name and get out
the right child abstract syntax tree
I'll figure out what the new value is by
calling evaluate expression because this
right hand side part could be more
complicated for example it could be a
bin up of a bunch of things so we're
going to need to walk down that tree and
interpret it translate it to figure out
what it means now we've got the new
value and we'll just promise ourselves
later on we're going to write some new
function called environment update that
changes the environment so that variable
name now points to new value this should
remind you a lot of the chart update
procedure that we wrote before however
there are other types of statements in
addition to assignments there are if
then else there are typically three
parts of an if-then-else the conditional
expression suppose our if then else is
if X is less than five then a LSB I
haven't drawn in the curly braces to
save space but this is the general idea
then our conditional expression is X is
less than five that's the guard that
tells us which way to go the then
statements are a the else statements are
be but before we go farther if there is
one complicating factor remember that in
JavaScript you can have multiple
statements inside this compound
statement block so really we have then
statements ax and else statements your
mission is to complete this code and you
can assume that there's a procedure
called eval underscore statements that
takes statements as an argument and an
environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
