the individuals that share five shorter
segments now this was kind of a tough
problem and you really could have gone
with either answer depending on how long
the long segment is between those shared
individuals for the single segment to be
ranked higher than the five short ones
you would have to roughly be about five
times bigger than any of the short
segments by themselves assuming that
they're all about the same size identity
by descent or IBD detection algorithms
have a threshold from which they
consider a segment to be long enough to
be reported as identity by descent so
the single segment would have to be
pretty big now due to the fact that
recombination occurs on every chromosome
in each generation it's unlikely very
unlikely that a long segment would be
transmitted along one chromosome and
nothing on the others but how unlikely
this is depends on the size of the
segment either way if you were to see a
difference where a comparison like this
you definitely have to go back examine
your coat and think about the genetics
behind what's going on to best represent
the outcome that should be true
computational biologists are really
smart people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
