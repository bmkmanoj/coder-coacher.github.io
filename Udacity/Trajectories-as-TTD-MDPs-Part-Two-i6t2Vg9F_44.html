you start in some steak there are
several actions you could take which
gets you to another set of states and so
on and so forth and this tree really
really really really kind of builds up
and you have a whole bunch in fact a
hyper exponential number possible
stories well if I have a probability
distribution for all partial
trajectories mm-hmm then it turns out
that whatever state I happen to be in
right now let's say this one mm-hmm I
don't actually have to care about any of
the rest of the tree it doesn't matter
because I can't get there see as you
pointed out it's a cyclical so even
though I can get from one plot point to
another I can't see a sequence that
doesn't involve going this way sure
position till yeah that's right but
underneath that node there's still an
awful lot of other nodes ah but if I
have a probability distribution for all
of the next states I could get to then I
simply have to execute the action and
then I will end up in one of these
states when I do it doesn't matter what
the other ones were and so all that's
ever happening is that I am following
one particular path down the tree and
how do we get from that target
distribution that's that's kind of
specifies the goal to a target
distribution over all the intermediate
nodes of the tree right that's the hard
part okay but it turns out there are
easy answers to it okay I'm just not
going to tell you what they are cool and
have you used this for actually making
stories yeah we actually have done this
for making stories and actually shown
that you can get people to feel
satisfied in there the stories or
experiences that they're having and you
can do it in real time on the fly and
and I'll just leave you with this little
teaser it involves using public library
divergence it's not exactly the most
exciting teaser I thought you were going
to say something about wolves again well
in the end that's all the wolf is I
would love to talk about it but I think
you know it's probably beyond the scope
of the class but I but we'll put in the
resources link a series of papers that
talk about this but the real answer is
that any time you're trying to match
probability distributions you care about
KL divergence and KL divergence is just
a bunch of sums up
probabilities and sums mean linear
independence independence means I can do
them in any order so I can basically
just ignore all the things that I don't
actually see and I only ever see a
finite and not just finite but linear in
the the number of plot points at any
given time and the hard part is you
recognize is figuring out what
probability distributions are for the
intermediate nodes I mean that can be
very hard because it can require
computing the whole hyper exponential
tree or it can be very easy if you have
a nice function that can map partial
trajectories into probabilities or some
other kind of value it's cool okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
