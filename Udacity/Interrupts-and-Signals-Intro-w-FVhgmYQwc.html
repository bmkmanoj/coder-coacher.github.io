structures we mentioned two terms that
we have not yet talked about interrupts
and signals let's take a moment now to
explain these concepts in a little more
detail interrupts are events that are
generated externally to a CPU by
components that are other than the CPU
where the interrupt is delivered
interrupts represent basically some type
of notification to the CPU that some
external event has occurred this can be
from i/o devices like a network device
delivering an interrupt that a network
packet arrives or from timers notifying
the CPU that time-out has occurred or
from other CPUs which particular
interrupts can occur on a given platform
depends on the specific configuration of
the platform like the types of devices
that it has for instance or the details
about the hardware architecture and
similar features another important
characteristic about interrupts is that
they appear asynchronously that's to say
that they're not in a direct response to
some specific action that's taking place
on the CPU signals on the other hand are
events that are triggered basically by
the software that's running on the CPU
there either for real generated by
software sort of like software
interrupts or the CPU hardware itself
triggers certain events that are
basically interpreted as signals which
signals can occur in a given platform
depends very much on the operating
system so two identical platforms will
have the same interrupts but if they're
running a different operating system
they will have different signals
unlike hardware interrupts signals can
appear both synchronously and
asynchronously by synchronous here we
mean that they occur in response to a
specific action that took place on the
CPU and in response to that action a
synchronous signal is generated for
instance if a process is trying to touch
memory that has not been allocated to it
then this will result in a synchronous
signal there are some aspects of
interrupts and signals that are similar
both interrupts and signals have a
unique identifier
err and it's valuable depend either on
the hardware in the case of interrupts
or on the operating system in the case
of signals both interrupts and signals
can be masked
for this we use either a per CPU mask
for the interrupt or a per process mask
for the signals to disable or to suspend
the notification that an interrupt or
signal is delivering the interrupts mask
is associated with a CPU because
interrupts are delivered to the CPU as a
whole whereas the signal mask is
associated with a process because
signals are delivered to individual
processes if the mask indicates that the
signal or the interrupt is enabled then
that will result in invoking the
corresponding handler the interrupt
handlers are specified for the entire
system by the operating system for the
signalling loss however the operating
system allows processes to specify their
per process handlink operations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
