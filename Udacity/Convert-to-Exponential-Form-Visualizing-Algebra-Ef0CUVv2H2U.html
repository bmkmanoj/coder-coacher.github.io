three-fifths power divided by root or
the index for the second one we'll have
the quantity of 3 to the fourth raised
to the 16 the power of this ratikan is
really a 1 so we have our power of 1
divided by our index or root which is 64
the third one will have the quantity 5x
squared raised to the one-third power
we're taking the cubed root of this
expression and again we don't use the
two as a power because the square is not
the power of the five as well it's only
the power of the X we have this quantity
raised to the 1 so there's our power and
then the three or the cube for our route
and for our last one we have 25 x
squared raised to the one-third power we
have power / our route you might have
simplified this which is great we could
have rewritten 25 x squared as the
quantity 5x squared then since we're
raising a power to a power we can
multiply two times one-third this would
give us 5 X raised to the two-thirds
another acceptable answer great work if
you got at least two of those correct I
know these were pretty tricky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
