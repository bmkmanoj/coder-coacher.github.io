this course and can't we decide anything
well of course rice theorem and
undecidability in general is prone to a
certain criticism I mean the crucial
thing to notice is that rice theorem
means that there is no algorithm that
can decide a functional property for any
program that we throw at it but this is
a very general case but rice theorem and
also the halting problem of course only
concern this very general case if you're
trying to prove something about a
program you know very well you might be
in a very different situation so if
you're trying to find out for example if
a program you wrote even halts and you
can't prove that or can't even you know
show that then maybe you should consider
writing some better understandable code
but what it does mean is that there is
no fully automated software testing
without trade-off so it means that fully
automated testing basically the dream of
a program and you throw any other
program at it and it will tell you if
it's correct if it stops if it crashes
that's a dream that we probably can't
fulfill but if we accept certain
trade-offs so for example if we accept
that that automated testing program will
be right most of the time or that it
only works on special cases then we
might be in a better situation so I
would interpret rice theorem not as a
general negative message but rather as a
piece of caution as to what computers
can do and cannot do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
