machine it's time to start thinking
about scaling up and scaling out so
let's bring our expert Adrian back in
what road you see containers playing in
the future of application development in
deployment well if you look at the
history of having large systems in the
data center bare metal machines they
would typically you'd buy them you
depreciate them over three years they'd
sit at the same IP address they get
installed once and used over and over
again
and you can think of those machines as
pets what we really want to do is have
cattle right so if you lose some you
know one cow out of a dairy herd you
still got milk right you go and get
another cow that's that kind of model
rather than having some machine that's
very specific
and everyone knows its name and if ever
anything goes wrong with that everyone
gets very unhappy so that transition
from sort of these very specific
machines to more sort of fleets of herds
of machines is something that happened
typically when you know you can do it
with with VMs but the m's take hours
you know these basically you usually but
get them by the hour and they last for a
few weeks and you know they have a much
shorter lifecycle but when we go to
containers became efficient enough that
you could actually get a machine in
seconds and you could run it for minutes
and that was a perfectly reasonable
thing to do so you can create an entire
test environment from scratch
run it end to end run all your tests
shut it down again and you can have lots
of those running in parallel so now
you've got machines some of them without
even you know you barely know they exist
they they come and go very very quickly
and finally sort of you take it right to
the limit you could create a container
just to run a single request and shut it
down again and that's you know something
that's starting to be called serverless
computing and there's a few frameworks
for doing that it's a kind of but that's
sort of the bleeding edge of what's
happening right now so when it comes to
writing containerized apps other than
make it smaller
what are problems that no one's talking
about so one of the problems is that
people get into is if they they keep
their old organization and the
practices so if you've got a micro
service or an application you're
building and the way you used to build
your monolith was you had teams spread
all around the world that contributed
code into this system and you spent you
know weeks or of putting everything
together so when we created software it
sort of followed the form that form this
is sometimes called Conway's law which
says that the structure of an
organization guides the kind of
structure of the code they produce so
what I'm really saying is that you can't
build micro services with a waterfall
organization so people might lose some
of the benefits of a micro services
pattern with organizational issues
mm-hmm what about technical issues like
monitoring logging what are problems
with those and so you need much more
automation there's a lot more moving
parts you need systems that dynamically
discover what to be monitored and you
can track them so that's the kind of
characteristic you're looking for that
sounds like a lot goes into it is this
something developers are programming
themselves we're looking back five years
when Netflix first started doing this
one of the things we had was that
because we were early we had to invent a
lot of stuff ourselves and there was
just you know we went and read papers
and we built things right and what the
situation now is that there's really too
many things to choose from you spend
more time trying to figure out which
github repo has something useful in it
which open-source project and which
which neo SAS vendor is trying to sell
you something so there's just too many
choices right now and those choices are
changing really rapidly so it sounds
like infrastructure is something really
important maybe not to code yourself
because there's so much you know find
something that works use it for now
change or readjust as you go
yeah there's no need to build it
yourself now yeah and there's there's
too many good options out there are too
many things you can just get hold of and
use there are cloud-based services
there's on-premise there's things you
can download for free so you know
something like kubernetes has a lot of
functionality you can just go use it and
you don't have to go try and build all
that yourself so we're building higher
and higher level services on top of lots
of detailed engineering what goes into
building these frameworks and then you
can build on top of them okay thank you
so much for coming in and talking to me
about this all right thanks very much
after talking with Adrian one of the
industry's leading experts on this
subject
it turns out that infrastructure is just
as important as application itself this
course is going to cover the theory and
implementation of managing that
infrastructure so in this course we're
going to move past theory and show you
how to do it and we'll be using
kubernetes for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
