down in math okay you like math right I
do okay so here's the math version of it
I'm gonna just say that the utility that
we receive for visiting a sequence of
states as zero as one as two ellipsis is
simply the sum of all the rewards that
we will receive for visiting those
states sure does that make sense yeah is
that consistent with what you were doing
when you were thinking about the grid
world yeah exactly but I thought we were
gonna make that not definitional we were
going to derive that it had to be that
way no we're not the they can read about
it it'd take me like an hour and a half
to deny it and I'm already losing my
voice but what I do want people I want
you to believe is that the utility of
the sequence of states thinking of it as
the sum of all the rewards makes sense
right and then nothing else at least it
makes it's consistent with what you've
been doing as we've been talking about
this grid world yeah absolutely I mean
it also kind of makes me think about
money go on well so so I mean that's
sort of how money works if we get some
kind of payoff each day those payoffs
get added to each other they don't get
you know subtracted or multiplied or
square rooted or whatever they just you
know they go into your bank account and
things add so this feels like kind of
like that it's like money in my pocket
sure if you have a big enough pocket
okay I'm with you on that all right so
I'm gonna say that this all makes sense
it it's really awesome
and it sort of doesn't work and to
illustrate why this doesn't work I'm
going to give you a quiz yay because you
like quizzes so I've been told</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
