the way there is one serious topic I
need to discuss which is multiple
inheritance and that's the answer to the
question of whether a class can have
more than one base class the answer
depends on the programming language in
Python the answer is yes other languages
don't allow this for example Java only
allows a single base class for a class
and works out other mechanisms to solve
some of the problems that we sell with
multiple inheritance in Python a class
can have multiple base classes and this
is both very useful and potentially
quite dangerous so here's an example so
remember what we did before we had a
discerning bear which was a subclass of
grizzly bear and it overrode the eat
method of bear to be discerning and not
eat humans named Dave so what should we
do if we want both discerning grizzly
bears and discerning black bears well
one solution would be to add a new
subclass that would be a discerning
black bear that would also override the
eat method and that would be a subclass
of black bear this seems like a bad
thing we've got a lot of duplication and
we've mixed up our notions of whether
bears discerning and whether can climb
or knock down trees so here's what we're
going to do instead well define a new
discerning bear class which is a
subclass of bear and overrides the eat
method then we can create a discerning
grizzly bear which is a subclass of both
a grizzly bear and a discerning bear
that means it will inherit the knockdown
method from grizzly bear and the eid
method from discerning bear and we could
also define a discerning black bear
class which would inherit the climb
method from black bear and the eat
method from discerning bear here's what
the code looks like it's the same
discerning bear class we had before
except for we've changed the base class
which was a grizzly bear now it's just a
bear to define the discerning grizzly
bear class all we need to do is inherit
from two base classes the discerning
bear and the grizzly bear we don't need
to define any new attributes we've got
all the behaviors we need by combining
those two similarly for the discerning
black bear all we need to do is inherit
from the discerning bear and the black
bear and we have everything we need so
this is pretty neat and can be very
useful but also can be a little bit
tricky so now we're going to have a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
