in Python code so up here we have our
normal imports here is where we define
the function and again we're simply
using X minus 1.5 squared plus 0.5 now
within this function we're going to go
ahead and print what the value is when
we get called it just is a little bit
handy here so that we can see what
exactly is going on but you don't have
to have that of course and then we
return Y now this is going to be the
function that we're going to ask
Sify or in particular the optimizer to
minimize for us and by the way we've
included this optimized package as SPO
so scifi.com eyes as SPO this is our
call now to the optimizer or the
minimizer before we call it we first set
our guest value to be 2.0 and we're
using the function minimize so we call
SPO to minimize F that's our function
here so we're saying minimizer please
minimize find the minimum for this
function X guess is our guests method is
where we're we're directing minimize to
use a particular minimizing algorithm
we'll talk a little bit about that a
little bit later but this is one of
those particular algorithms that happens
to work pretty nicely we send it one
more option here disp which is true
which means we just want it to be
verbose about things that it discovers
anyways that's it that calls the
minimizer the minimizer repeatedly calls
our function and finds the minimum value
then it prints it prints out those
results let's try a test run and see
what happens remember in our function
that we want to minimize we explicitly
printed x and y so here you can see
time it gets called it prints these
values out and so the minimizer is
repeatedly calling that function f and
it's printing these things out so it
gets called initially with an X of two
and it discovers that the value is 0.75
then a value slightly greater than two
values slightly less than 2 and the
minimizer very quickly converges on 1.5
as the answer and here it prints out
those values finds the minima at 1.5
with a value of 0.5 there so pretty
efficient and effective discovery of the
minimization I added a few more lines of
code here which I'll highlight merely to
plot the answer so all the rest of the
code is the same but let's take a look
now if we plot it as well so same result
as before but nice plot with our minimum
identified right here so that is how to
code up a minimizer it's really very
easy and really powerful let's look at
it a little bit further</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
