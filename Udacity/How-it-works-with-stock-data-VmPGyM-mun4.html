approach now for stock data this is one
of our pandas dataframes that contains
some factors or features of stocks and
it's arranged in the usual way where
each column represents the value of the
feature for a particular stock and time
goes downward essentially now we might
have many features for each stock for
instance we might have Bollinger Bands
momentum p/e ratio and so on we
represent that by stacking these one
behind the other so remember this is
potentially multi-dimensional
these are our X's what is our Y in most
cases we want to use our historical
feature data to predict a future price
but to train our model we're going to
use historical price as well so the
value of these factors are features
today we call X and we'd like to be able
to run that through the model that we've
built and get Y which is our predicted
future price well we don't have that
model yet we've got to learn it and
we've got to learn it from data so
here's how we do that we roll back time
so that we're back in history here at
our first data point we look at the
values of our features there and then we
look say five days into the future to
see what that future price is so now
we've got a pairing of these features
with that future Y we saved that XY pair
into our data and remember X can be
multi-dimensional and that's one
instance of data we move forward one day
so we've got a new set of X's and a new
y and we record that in our database
eventually we reach a point where we
can't go any further because there's no
more Y data in other words if we're one
one day past this Y would be out here in
the future so we don't have that data to
use and that means we've got some left
over X data in any case we now for each
of these days in history
a pair of X's and Y's that we can feed
into our database to build our model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
