implement our hash table index is we
have to figure out how to create an
empty hash table with the symbol index
this was really easy to make an empty
index we just have an empty list there
were no elements so we could initialize
the index by just initializing it to an
empty list and as we added elements to
the list we would just add them to the
empty list for the hash table that's not
going to work we need to do something
more complicated to start with an empty
hash table and the reason for this is we
need to start with all the buckets so
our initial value for the plain index
was just an empty list our initial value
for a hash table needs to be a set of
empty buckets and the reason for that is
we want to be able to do lookups right
away and we want to be able to add
elements to our hash table if we just
started with an empty list well then the
first time we look up a keyword it would
say that keyword belongs in bucket 27 we
don't have a bucket for that we would
need to figure out how to create that
bucket it makes a lot more sense to
start by making our empty hash table be
a list of buckets where initially all
the buckets are empty they're ready
waiting for keywords to be placed in
them so what we need is code to create
that empty hash table so I think you
know enough to define make hash table
yourself so we'll make that a quiz so
your goal is to define a procedure will
call it make underscore hash table that
takes as input a number giving the
number of buckets in the hash table and
it outputs an empty hash table that has
that number of empty buckets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
