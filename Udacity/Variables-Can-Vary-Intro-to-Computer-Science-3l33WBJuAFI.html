the important thing about variables in
Python is that they can vary that's why
they're called variables once we define
a variable we can change the value and
then when we use that name again
it refers to the new value so let's see
that in the interpreter we could change
the value of cycles per second suppose
we have a faster processor now we've
upgraded we've got a 2.8 gigahertz
processor now that doesn't affect the
value of cycle distance this was already
computed with the old cycles per second
we still get the result point 1 1 1 well
computed again this time the value of
cycles per second is the new value since
we changed what cycles per second refers
to and now when we print cycle distance
we see that the values changed so we
have a faster processor the second time
we print cycle distance now we only have
point 107 meters less than 11
centimeters per cycle so what happens
now that we have assignment the same
expression can have different meanings
different times we evaluate it the value
of this speed of light divided by cycles
per second depends on what the current
value of cycles per second is when we
evaluate the first one the value was 2
billion 700 million so we got a
different result which is the point 1 1
1 result we got the first time when we
evaluate the same expression the second
time the results different because the
value that cycles per second refers to
is different and that's why we get the
smaller cycle distance the second time
so let's see what's going on there and
make sure we understand assignment so
suppose we have a variable days and
we'll initialize it to the value 7 times
7 so what that does is introduce the
named days and refers to a value which
is the result of that expression so
refers to the value 49 and that means
when we look up the name days we see
what it refers to and we get the result
49 if we do another assignment let's say
we have one less day and in this case
we'll assign 48 to days well that's a
new assignment we already have a named
days it used to refer to 49 but after
the new assignment is going to refer to
this new value now it's going to refer
to the value 48
the number 49 still exists but days no
longer refers to it nowadays refers to
48 where things get more interesting is
we can use variables in their own
assignment statements so here we have an
assignment statement where we have the
value days minus 1 and we assign that to
days so what happens with that
assignment
well we evaluate the right side first we
look for the value of days and we see
that it refers to 48 we compute days
minus 1 and we get the value 47 then we
do the assignment that we'll assign to
the variable days so now the value days
refers to the value 47 no longer refers
to 48 so we could keep doing that if we
did another statement the same exact one
that's gonna change the value again this
time the first time the value days is 47
we'll subtract 1 we'll get the value 46
and then we do the assignment that'll
change the value so now days refers to
the value 46 so the important thing to
notice this is not an equal symbol this
looks like an equal symbol if you
studied algebra you would think an
equation like this looks like an
equality and there's no way to solve an
equation like that in Python and in most
programming language equal does not mean
equal what equal means is assignment you
should really think of it as an arrow
it's an arrow saying put whatever value
the right side evaluates to into the
name on the left side we don't write it
as an arrow in most programming
languages there's some that do just
because an arrow is harder to type and
lots of programs have lots of
assignments but you should think of the
equal sign as not meaning equal it means
assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
