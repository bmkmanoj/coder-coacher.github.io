introduced when we do segmentation the
idea is in mean shift is to find the
modes of a distribution or our
probability densities remember the modes
are sort of the peaked areas and here's
the basic underlying assumption the
assumption is I've got a bunch of
samples that have been drawn from some
probability distribution function and
you want to find the modes so this is
beautiful a couple of beautiful examples
out there on the web feel free to steal
whichever one you want I stole this one
so here we have our set of particles and
they're just drawn from some density and
probably if I were to ask you where is
the mode you'd probably say that it's
somewhere around here
okay and the goal is for the system to
find that on its own so here we again we
have our sample so let's put down a
region okay it's called a region of
interest now we're not gonna talk about
the size of that region just yet or its
shape we'll talk about that a little bit
later it's gonna be a Gaussian but for
now it's just gonna be a circle so we
have this region and we calculate okay
of all of the points in that circle
where is the mean that or the center of
mass and we say up it's not right in the
middle and that difference between them
that's called the mean shift vector so
this is called the mean shift algorithm
amazing huh
and so what do you do with the mean
shift vector well you shift the mean and
there it goes they're not that they're
not perfect okay what do we do we do it
again okay here's where we are here's
the the weighted mean of the new samples
there's our mean shift vector what do we
do we shift it again um and we do it one
more time there it is oh we're getting
close now small mean shift vector shift
and then finally guess what we are in
the right spot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
