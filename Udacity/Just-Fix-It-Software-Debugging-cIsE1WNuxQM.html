fixed a first burg using the scientific
method to systematically come up with
the hypothesis and refine it refine it
again possibly come up with alternatives
until we end up with the diagnosis so if
you're an experienced programmer and I
assume you are you may not wonder why on
earth should I actually go through all
these explicit steps if I can just jump
into my debugger and fix the problem
right away it's actually likely that you
have spotted the problem at the very
moment you saw the code if you're a very
experienced programmer you can probably
spot errors like these in hundreds and
hundreds of lime from a distance of
several hundred meters you just look at
the code and immediately see well
there's something fishy in there and all
of this is of course right there's many
problems which can immediately see in
which you can immediately fix within
five minutes including the one we just
discussed and it's perfectly okay if it
only takes five minutes to jump right
into your editor and to fix things to
jump into your interactive debugger and
fix thing as long as it doesn't take
more than five minutes because what
happens if it takes more than that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
