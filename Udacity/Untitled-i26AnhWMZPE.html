working on which closely resembles a
radio group to determine what kind of
keyboard support it needs I'll check the
Aria design patterns guide and I'm going
to jump down to section 11 which lists
all of the various components and their
patterns once we're down here I'll look
for a component that sort of matches the
one that I'm building in this case I can
see that there's a radio button right
about here so we'll click on that and
based on the recommendations there are a
number of keyboard handlers that I know
I now need to implement using this guide
I'm going to implement the down arrow /
right arrow support in my element now
when the user presses the down arrow we
know that our radio group should move
focus to the next radio button it should
select that button and it focuses on the
last item and focus will wrap around to
the first item to do this we're going to
use a technique called roving focus
Rowland focus works by setting tab index
to negative 1 for all of the children
and then 0 on the currently active item
our component then uses a keyboard event
listener to determine which key the user
has pressed at which point we set
tabindex on the next item 20 we set
tabindex of the previously focused item
to negative 1 we call the focus method
of this new soon to be focused item this
now moves our focus ring and lastly I'm
going to just move this checked
attribute down to this element using set
attribute in this case i'm using the CSS
in my element based on that checked
attribute just style the state of the
radio button now when I reach the bottom
of this list and this last radio is
focused and the user presses the down
arrow then we're going to wrap back
around so we'll set tab next to zero on
this top item will move checked over
there we'll call focus and we'll set tab
and X 2 negative 1 on the previously
focused item for building complex
components roving focus is a really
invaluable technique so in the next
lesson you're going to take a crack at
implementing it yourself using this same
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
