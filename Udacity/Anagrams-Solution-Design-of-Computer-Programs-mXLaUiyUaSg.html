to write a helper function called find
on anagrams that takes the letters in
the phrase with all the spaces removed
so I'm calling find anagrams with the
spaces replaced by nothing so get rid of
the spaces in the original phrase and
then I want to make sure that the
anagrams I find the words are in
alphabetical order and the way I'm going
to do that is by passing in to find
anagrams the previous word on every
recursive call and for the first call we
can just say the previous word was the
empty string and then I find I have to
also pass in the shortest allowable word
we're looking for so what is fine
anagrams do it's got the same kind of
structure that we saw before we
initialize an empty set at the end we're
going to return it and then we use the
previously defined fine words function
so remember for scrabble we take any
letters in their hand and find all the
possible words so let's do that for the
words that come back are they long
enough for the greatest than the what
we're allowed for shortest and are they
in alphabetical order are they greater
than the previous word if so then use
the previously defined remove function
to tell me what the remaining letters
are and if there is no remainder then
let's just add that word into the
results and and we're done otherwise
let's recursively call find anagrams
with the remainder and then add in that
result with a space in between them so
this is how we're finding anagrams that
are longer than just one word long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
