model for structuring server
applications that perform concurrent
processing the model we'll talk about is
called event-driven model an
event-driven application can be
characterized as follows the application
is implemented in a single address space
there is basically only a single process
and a single thread of control here is
the illustration of this model and this
is taken from the leg PI's flash paper
as well the main part of the process is
a event dispatcher that continuously in
a loop looks for incoming events and
then based on those events invokes one
or more of the registered handlers here
events correspond to some of the
following things receive the per request
from the client browsers that message
that's received from the network that's
an event completion of a send so once
the server responds to the client
request the fact that the same completed
that's another event as far as the
system is concerned completion of a
discrete operation that's another event
that the system will need to know how to
handle the dispatcher has the ability to
accept any of these types of
notifications and then based on the
notification type to invoke the
appropriate handler so in that sense it
operates very much like a state machine
since we're talking about a single
threaded process invoking a handler
simply means that we will jump to the
appropriate location in the processes
address space where the handler is
implemented at that point the handler
execution can start for instance if the
process is notified that there is a
pending connection request on the
network work that it uses the dispatcher
will pass that event to the accept
connection handler if the event is a
receipt of a data of message on an
already established connection then the
event dispatcher will pass that to the
read request Handler once the file name
is extracted from the request and it's
confirmed that the file is present the
process will send out chunks of the file
and then once there is a confirmation
that that chunk of the file portion of
the file has been successfully sent and
it will continue iterating over
the handler that's the link with the
send operation if the file is not there
then some sort of error message will be
sent to the client so whenever an event
occurs the handlers are the sequence of
code that executes in response to these
events the key feature of the handlers
is that they run to completion if a
handler needs to perform a blocking
operation it will initiate the blocking
operation and then it will immediately
pass control back to the event
dispatcher so will no longer be in the
handle at that point the dispatcher is
free to service other events or call
other handlers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
