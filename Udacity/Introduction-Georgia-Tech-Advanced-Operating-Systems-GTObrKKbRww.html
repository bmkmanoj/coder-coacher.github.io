today you're likely to find several
applications open one for listening to
music one for playing a video game a web
browser displaying information on some
ancient culture from some remote corner
of the world and a messaging application
for connecting with friends and so on
how is it possible for a single device
to do all these things and moreover do
them all at the same time how can all
these diverse applications written by
different programmers who don't even
know each other coordinate who's in
charge here the answer of course is the
operating system hello and welcome to CS
62 10 advanced operating systems my name
is Keisha Ramachandran and I'll be
taking you on a journey to understand
the role played by the operating system
in providing the rich user experience
afforded to modern applications by
modern computers and along the way I'll
highlight the symbiotic relationship
between hardware and software that makes
it possible for the computer and the
operating system to provide the rich
user experience to please you operating
systems have evolved over time in this
course we will see all the advances that
have been made in the operating system
that has led to the state-of-the-art in
operating systems today covering a
variety of platforms from cell phones to
multi-core to parallel systems the
distributed computing and cloud
computing in part 1 of this introductory
lesson my goal is to primarily talk
about the power of abstraction that will
lay the foundation for the rest of the
introductory lesson which will include
an overview of the hardware resources
managed by the operating system the
operating system functionality that is
expected and the abstractions in an
operating system for managing the
hardware resources by the end of the
lesson we will be ready to discuss the
structure of operating systems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
