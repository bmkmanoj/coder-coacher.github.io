process there here's three things that
you should consider first off I would
suggest treating the entire system
itself as an object and that any of the
objects which you are actually going to
have in your program would be attributes
of that overall system object second as
we've just mentioned it may be the case
that you're going to have to decide how
to deal with associations and invariance
and third as we'll see a little bit
later in this lesson although you're
going to have in your oo design classes
that were originally specified during
your object oriented alisis you're also
going to have some addition additional
classes and we want to look at what are
the circumstances that would lead you to
having some additional classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
