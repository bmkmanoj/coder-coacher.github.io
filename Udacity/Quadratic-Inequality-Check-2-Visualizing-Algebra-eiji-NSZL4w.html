between negative two-thirds and positive
one-third now that's amazing problem
solving if you got this one correct to
start this problem we want to subtract
two from both sides of the inequality
this gives us a quadratic expression on
the left and 0 on the right now we want
to find the zeros are the values of P
that make this quadratic expression
equal to 0 we find factors of negative
18 that sum to positive 3 those two
factors are positive 6 and negative 3
and we use them to rewrite the middle
term of plus 3p using factoring by
grouping we get the factors 3p plus 2
and 3 P minus 1 next we set each factor
equal to 0 and then we solve for the
values of P so P could equal negative
two-thirds or P could equal positive
one-third next we use our 20 values to
create three different intervals and now
it's just a matter of testing each one
to see which ones are part of the
solution for the first interval will
plug in p is equal to negative 1 when we
plug in this value for P will get this
statement for is less than 0 we know
this statement is not true so we exclude
this interval from our solution set for
the second interval will test the value
of 0 we know zeros in between these two
fractions since one of them is negative
and the other ones positive when we plug
in p equals 0 we get the statement
negative 2 is less than 0 this is
definitely true so this part is part of
our solution set for the third interval
will test p equals one and we'll get the
statement 10 is less than zero we know
this is false so this is not part of our
solution which leaves us with this
interval only any value between negative
two thirds and positive one-third we'll
make our original inequality true we
also use parenthesis here and in our
interval notation since this is just a
less than symbol we can't be equal to 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
