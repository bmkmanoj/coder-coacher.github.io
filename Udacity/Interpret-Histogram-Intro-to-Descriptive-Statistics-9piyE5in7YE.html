distributed that's very important a
normal distribution has one peak right
here called the mode and it looks like
most scores fall out around 20% and in
fact when you looked at the interactive
ate software in the last video when I
showed you the different bin sizes for
this data it said that the mean was
19.151 which is at about 20% the shape
is roughly symmetrical you can see that
it follows a distribution that looks
kind of like this and if you were to
fold it across this line it would pretty
much overlap right on top of each other
now 35% is at about here so we cannot
say that the most common body fat
percent is 35 we can however say that
most scores fall in the middle of the
distribution here's the middle and you
can see that 64 approximately men fall
right here in the middle with these two
bins are there more scores between 15
and 25 than 35 and 50 15 and 25 covers
this middle area here but 35 and 50 goes
from here out to about here so yes we
can say there are more scores between 15
and 25 and 35 and 50 how about between 0
and 10 doesn't look like there are many
scores whereas between 18 and 24 that
covers pretty much this whole section so
no we cannot say this and finally do
relatively fewer men have a body fat
percentage above 35 or below 5% yes only
a few men have that body fat percentage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
