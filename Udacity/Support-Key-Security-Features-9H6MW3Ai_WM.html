want in a trusted computing base I
wanted to be trustworthy wanted to be
high assurance and we said even in a
follow some design principle so let's
talk a little bit about how do we build
a trusted computing base well first of
all if we claim it to be a trusted
computing base it has to implement
certain key requirements or features
that you associate with the secure
system in other words it must implement
certain security relevant functions
certain functions that are important for
securing access to resources so for
example it has to address authentication
if it doesn't address authentication we
will know who's making a request for a
resource that is protected in the system
it has to do access control access
control for whatever resources that we
have could be files could be other kind
of objects that we have when it comes to
access control we talked about two
different kinds of access control we
talked about the mandatory access
control it may support that it may
support labels that can be used to
implement the blp model for example or
some of the other mandatory access
control models that we discussed it has
to support discretionary access control
so somebody who creates a resource they
have some control over who can access it
and who cannot access it the basic idea
here is that when you say I'm going to
build a trusted computing ways the first
question you have to think about is well
there's some core functions I have to
provide some core mechanisms that have
to go into the system and these are some
examples of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
