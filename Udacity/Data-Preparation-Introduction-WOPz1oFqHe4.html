with the business issue understanding
will help you as you prepare the data
for your analysis which is the third
step of the problem-solving framework
when starting an analysis it's a rare
occasion for the data to be ready
without some level of preparation
preparing the data generally includes
one or more of the following actions
gathering cleansing formatting blending
and sampling the data when gathering the
data you may need to collect data from
multiple sources within your
organization the data set you are
working with may have issues that you
want to resolve prior to your analysis
this can be in the form of incorrect or
missing data you may need to format the
data by changing the way a date field
appears renaming a field or even
rotating the data similar to using a
pivot table you may want to blend or
combine your data with other data sets
to enrich it with additional variables
similar to using the vlookup function in
Excel and lastly you may want to sample
the data set and work with a more
manageable number of Records referring
back to our electricity example we
identified that we may need to obtain
some data from the National Weather
Service to get forecast high and low
temperatures as well as historical
temperature data the data we obtain may
not be in a usable format so we may need
to prepare the data for analysis by
formatting enriching and cleansing the
data will also gather data from our
internal systems such as past
electricity usage as well as any other
data we may have that may prove useful
to our analysis Maureen Wolfson has
dedicated an entire course of preparing
your data for analysis and will go into
detail about the data preparation step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
