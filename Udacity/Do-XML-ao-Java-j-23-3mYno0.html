resources in the Java code but what
exactly is the relationship between the
resources and the Java code how do they
come together as part of a full app
experience let's start at the point when
you click on the just Java app icon it
opens up the main activity now you don't
see anything yet because it's still
being initialized thankfully a lot of
the complexity involved in initializing
the activity is handled automatically
for you by Android the important part
that we care about is that in the main
activity file the oncreate method gets
called automatically this is when the
activity is getting created it has a
bunch of work and then we have an
important line that says set content
view and then the resource ID for the
layout file
it's our dot layout activity main this
means that the content view of the
activity should be set to the layout as
specified in the activity main.xml file
this is a method call and the input
parameter is this resource ID once you
set the layout that you're going to use
for the content view then the Android
device can go ahead and start parsing
this XML layout file parsing is like
reading this file and trying to
interpret that like oh this is a linear
layout oh this is a textview these are
the attributes and so on so it's trying
to understand what this file contains
the Android device starts by reading at
the top of the file it recognizes that
there's a linear layout here then it
inflates a Java object to represent that
linear layout then it goes to the next
line and sees that we need to add a
textview as a child to that linear
layout like that this is starting to
look like the view hierarchy from lesson
2 what I didn't tell you earlier is that
this is actually a hierarchy of Java
objects we're going to be learning more
about Java objects in the coming videos
so it's okay if you don't fully
understand it yet when we get to the
next line we see that we need to inflate
a linear layout Java object that gets
added as a child to this route linear
layout then we see a button element so
we add that as a child to the linear
layout so we continue down the file
until we've inflated all the views that
we need for our view hierarchy once we
have this view hierarchy of Java objects
then we can manipulate them and
change them while the app is running an
object like the textview here contains
state information like the text the text
color the text size the object also has
methods so we can call those methods and
change that internal state so for
example we can change the text while the
app is running interacting with all of
these objects is called object-oriented
programming we will cover this in more
detail in the coming videos so to
summarize in the main activity when we
call set content view to this layout
then we read this layout and then
inflate a bunch of Java objects these
Java objects make up the view hierarchy
of the app the main activity holds on to
this view hierarchy and then as you
interact with the main activity it can
update these objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
