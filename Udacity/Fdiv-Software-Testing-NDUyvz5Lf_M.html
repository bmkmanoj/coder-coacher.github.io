so we have is by assumption we can run
one test every 10 microseconds now there
are a million microseconds in a second
two seconds in a minute and 60 minutes
in an hour and 24 hours in a day all
right so now we're going to do some unit
cancellation we can kill microseconds we
can kill minutes we can kill seconds and
we can kill hours so if we do with the
multiplication we can get tests per day
if we do that we get 8 billion 640
million tests per day now if we multiply
this testing throughput by the failure
rate or you get one failure for nine
billion inputs or nine billion tests i
should say we can can cancel tests do
the division and arrive at point nine
six expected failures per day so wonder
what I think are fairly modest
assumptions here if we perform
completely random testing of the input
space for F div we should be able to
find this bug in about a day and so now
this kind of testing is going to need
some sort of an Oracle so we're going to
need a way to tell if a particular
output from F div is correct or not and
the way this is going to work is I
Triple E floating point which is which
is what F div is implementing is
specified very tightly that is to say
one implementation of I Triple E
floating point division has to return
the same bit pattern as another
implementation that's one of the nice
things about that particular
specification is that it's fairly tight
so we ask ourselves what would have been
Oracle for F div and probably it would
have been Intel's existing 487 floating
point unit which had been around for
some years by the time they were
developing the Pentium so I think this
shows unless I've messed up sort of
egregiously on the math somewhere is
that random testing would have been a
perfectly good way to find the Intel
Pentium fdf law presuming of course that
we could have found a way to rig up a
Pentium in concert with a 47 in such a
way that they could have cooperated to
do the testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
