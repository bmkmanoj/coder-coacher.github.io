lot of statistics we can run on it to
characterize it for instance of course
we might be interested in the mean we
might also be interested in the standard
deviation which is essentially on
average how far do individual
measurements deviate from the mean
another very important measure is
something called kurtosis kurtosis comes
from a Greek word that means curved or
arching so what does kurtosis mean well
let me show you kurtosis tells us about
the tails of the distribution so the
tails are the parts out here towards the
ends and if we assume that our
distribution is similar to a Gaussian
distribution or normal distribution the
measure of kurtosis tells us how much
different our histogram is from that
traditional Gaussian distribution so in
this case we have what are called fat
tails
we've got them over here and over here
what that means is that there are
occasional and and more frequent than
would happen if we had a regular
Gaussian distribution there are
frequently large excursions more
frequently than if this was a normal
distribution if you were to measure the
kurtosis of this histogram you would get
a positive number meaning that there are
more occurrences out in these tails than
would be expected if it were a normal
distribution if you measured a negative
kurtosis it would mean that there are
many fewer occurrences out here on the
tails than would be expected if it were
a normal distribution so we can plot our
data in this sort of bar chart called a
histogram we can measure statistics on
it like standard deviation mean and
kurtosis and remember the following
about kurtosis if we've got a positive
kurtosis that means we've got fat tails
like in this example there's more
occurrences outside in the tails than
would normally happen with a Gaussian
distribution
and if we've got a negative kurtosis
we've got skinny tails meaning there's
less out there now I'm gonna hand it
over to Dave and she's going to show you
how to make this plot and calculate
these numbers in Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
