looks like at the complex roots of unity
each row corresponds to the powers of
one of the roots so for one the powers
are all one the powers of Omega R one
then Omega then Omega squared all the
way up through Omega to the N minus one
the next value is I'll make it to the
second so we go Omega squared to the
zeroth power is one to the first power
that ends up being is Omega squared and
then we have a mega to the fourth Omega
to the sixth etc in general the Caged
eighth element is Omega raised to the K
minus 1 times J minus one power this
matrix has some very special properties
for our purposes however the key one can
be summarized with the following claim
we'll let Omega be a primitive nth root
of unity this means that all of its
powers 0 through n minus 1 are unique
well then the vandermonde matrix
parameterised by Omega as defined here
times the 1 parameterised by Omega
inverse is equal to n times the identity
matrix for the proof consider the KJ
element of the product for this we're
multiplying the K throw of M sub n of
Omega with the jth column of n sub n of
Omega inverse so we're taking
corresponding powers of Omega to the K
minus 1 and Omega 2 the negative J minus
1 multiplying those together and then
adding all those up gathering turns from
the exponent this becomes the sum over L
of Omega to the K minus J times elf
power now if K is equal to J then every
term here is 1 and the overall sum is n
otherwise we recognize this as a
geometric series and rewrite it as this
ratio here note however that Omega to
the J minus K power is a root of unity
and then raising that to the
nth power must necessarily be one so
this numerator expression is zero the
whole thing is zero and that then proves
our claim this is terribly important
recall that valuating a polynomial at
the roots of unity correspond to
multiplying the coefficients by this
matrix here M sub n of Omega and we use
the fast Fourier transform to do that
now we see that we can multiply these
values by essentially the inverse of
this matrix also using the fast Fourier
transform and this will allow us to
recover the coefficients given values
this is why it was so key that the fast
Fourier transform
work with any root of unity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
