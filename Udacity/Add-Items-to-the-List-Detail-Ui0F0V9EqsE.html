new data it's time to write the code
that will write these shopping list
items into the correct location and read
them as well ok so in our shopping list
page we currently have a useless button
for adding more items when I click add
item here doesn't really do anything
here's what I want you to do when you
click the fab and you enter the name of
the item and you press add item what it
should do is it should see what shopping
list you're on go to a node called
shopping list items use the push ID for
the shopping list that you're currently
on and create a item under that push ID
did you catch all that let me show you a
quick example so you've got a shopping
list with a push ID 1234 when I want to
add a new item such as bacon to this
shopping list it'll go to the snowed
shopping list items make a node with the
same key as the shopping list up here
and then put the bacon item there if I
wanted to then add lettuce and tomato to
the same list with the key one two three
four they would also be added to the
node shopping list items with the child
one two three four now you might have
noticed that I didn't tell you what the
keys for these would be what you want to
make these keys is up for you to figure
out and just to drive what's going on
home let's say that I have another list
with the push key 1999 and I wanted to
add cooking oil that would look like
this instead of adding it on to the list
of items in one two three four you would
go to the list 1999 and make a new item
there getting the data to add in the
correct place is the trickiest part of
this exercise remember that you should
have saved the list ID in a member
variable called em list ID just like
when we started to have multiple
shopping lists start by just getting the
data to appear in the firebase back end
once you've got the data correctly
adding itself in the back end then you
should set up a firebase list adapter
that will display your items here this
actually really isn't much different
than when we added the firebase list
adapter in the shopping list fragment so
you can refer to that if you need to
I'll send over respect now oh and
finally sorry before I forget you should
remember also that when you delete a
list using this removed dialogue that it
should also delete all the items that
are associated with the list okay good
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
