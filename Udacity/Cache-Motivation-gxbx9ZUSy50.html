examine this little snippet of code from
an application programmers perspective a
statement like this one the sum plus
equals a of I would seem to happen in
one step even in assembly it would only
take a few instructions in terms of time
on the clock however not all of these
instructions are the same some being a
local variable is most likely stored in
a register in the CPU therefore there's
almost no cost to retrieving its value
if I however is in main memory and
retrieving its value can take a hundred
CPU cycles and even then the bus bendeth
might only be able to pass back two
bytes a cycle or there abouts to get the
data back trips to main memory are
expensive and this trend has only become
worse over the past few decades with
hardware advances the solution to this
problem has been to place a smaller
faster set of memory made with faster
technology closer to the CPU we call
this memory cache and here we're looking
at a latency of about 10 cycles so when
the CPU wants the contents of some
memory address it looks in the cache
first if it finds the data it needs
great
we just achieved a factor of ten
speed-up we call this a cache hit if the
data it wants is not in the cache then
we have to go to main memory we call
this a cache miss the key is keeping
these cache misses infrequent so that on
average time spent accessing is more
like the time it takes to access the
cache than it is like that the time to
access main memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
