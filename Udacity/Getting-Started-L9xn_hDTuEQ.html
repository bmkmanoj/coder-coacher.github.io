with a blank sheet I mean I can't tell
you how many times I've gone to start
writing some article and I'm just
looking at the blank page and I'm
thinking where do I start do you give
that feeling sometimes daram when you
start with something new yeah it's hard
you have to you have to kind of yeah set
yourself up I mean everyone has their
own techniques for just getting moving
on a project you know often you can just
start with the things you know like you
know you're going to use a model view
some kind of controller things so like
what can you start adding you know if
the map maybe you're talking about
places you know just finding someplace
you can start and just start adding
things and then eventually like the
questions will maybe just come a gas
during at that blank sheet of paper as
you say is definitely definitely
difficult yeah I would say to kind of
just pick one part of the project to
figure out first whether it's the
listview whether you want to get the
search box working whether you want to
get parts of the map working I would
pick one thing kind of figure out bits
and pieces of it kind of put that part
together and also don't hesitate to kind
of step away from the big project and
maybe start just like a little sample
project where you're like I'm really
having a hard time figuring out how to
sort or how to sort you know stuff in my
list or how to get all my markers to
have unique info windows it's good
practice to maybe just say okay I think
I've done a lot on my project I don't
want to break what I have let me kind of
write something up here and just sort of
a little side project and see if I can
get this functionality working and then
figure out how to apply it back to my
architecture that I've designed here I
do that a lot myself I mean there's a
lot of times where I'm working on a
project and I'm like you know I don't
really can't figure out how to get like
this navigation to like pop out right so
I kind of make like a little dummy site
I kind of play around with things it's
easy for me to do it that way because
it's on a much smaller scale and I'm
less worried about breaking it to the
stuff in the process or having to do
like a
get commits or something it's definitely
useful to like take a step back look at
sort of the smaller problems and knock
out some smaller things first this is
the first project where students are
given anything like you give them you
know to knock out framework but they
don't really get any code to begin with
so all the products before this they are
doing some code or something to sort of
work out oh and i think you know just
opening up your your text editor to just
a blank page can be a little daunting
but especially for someone who's really
new at this what kind of advice you get
to send money p yeah he's kind of faced
with this blank page well um first of
all tell you that as someone who's been
coding for a long time I still get
writer's block when you first of length
right how do you say yeah yeah it's it's
not something that entirely goes away
but it is something we'd better at right
so if you open up if you open up your
gear text editor and there's nothing
there alright so what do we know should
be there well we definitely need an HTML
file without an HTML file you got
nothing hey welcome so you need an HTML
file you eat all of the basic HTML
boilerplate right depending on your
tools you can actually plug instead
we'll just put all of the doctype HTML
HTML head body all that stuff in there
for you um so that unlike the Phi's the
page a little bit right um but still
effectively you don't have any Content
any stuff that you put on Tate right you
also need to link up your CSS file
probably unless you're making something
that's just kind of a proof of concept a
CSS off silent they also need a
JavaScript file at least one you also
have multiple girls well just depends on
how you want to learn it um but then
where do you go from it and
I suppose if if I can tell you what I I
can't really tell I can't be frightened
but what i would do is i would start I I
wouldn't worry about styling I wouldn't
worry about CSS I would just put some
piss on the page that represent two
different areas right no we need a map
so I don't look at the google maps but
um but actually even before you do that
I would try and get an idea of how
generally to get started so I mean I
might even go to the knockout home page
and look at their very basic examples
and just get their example right even
though i don't necessarily need a text
box that says hello world with an input
box that says the same thing change them
i may not need that but it gets
something on the screen and once you
have something on the screen you can be
like oh that's right ok I've got
observables I've got data binding a data
by connecting up um all right now my
memory is jog I am I'm ready to move
forward so I want to put a list all
right so what could I use an observable
and a favorable array how do i connect
that up all right let's look at example
oh that's right that's how that works
you know so it's not so much about
necessarily going in the right direction
right out upstart hidden it's about
getting your bearings and um just got
pippin something that we didn't thinking
something just go in some garage yeah
right um I'm you don't go off at the
event don't start coding and it is a
framework than you append to obviously
but um this build something once you've
built something it'll be so much easier
to course-correct and change your course
towards where you ultimately end up so
that's a little bit about how I work I
don't know it may not be for everybody
but that's been useful for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
