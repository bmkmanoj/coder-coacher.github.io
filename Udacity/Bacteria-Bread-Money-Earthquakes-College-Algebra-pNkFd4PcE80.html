lot of new information about exponential
and logarithmic functions you've seen
their graphs you learned about
properties that apply to them and you've
also learned how to evaluate and
manipulate them in the coming videos
we're going to explore various
strategies to solve a variety of
exponential and logarithmic equations a
few lessons ago we touched on an
application problem where we consider
the amount of bacteria which remained
alive after a patient was medicated this
lesson is going to give you the tools
you need to solve other application
problems as well maybe you're earning
interest on a certain amount of money
that you've put in a savings account
then we'd have an equation like this
12,500 equals ten thousand times 1.03 to
the T or perhaps you've just bought a
loaf of bread but you're about to go on
vacation we could use an equation like
this to figure out how much mold would
grow on the bread after a certain amount
of time or what have you just been
through an earthquake and you want to
figure out how intense the quake was
well you could use equations like these
two to talk about that this one
characterizes the earthquake that
happened in Japan in 2011 and this one
talks about the worst earthquake that
ever happened to California which was in
1857 these scenarios are all going to be
super interesting to look at but I think
we should wait a bit until we get to
them for now though let's stick with
something pretty simple you've been
working with exponents a lot lately so I
think this equation is a good choice we
have 4 to the x equals 64 what does X
equal then now some of you might be able
to do this in your head or if that seems
tricky you can try guessing and checking
using a calculator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
