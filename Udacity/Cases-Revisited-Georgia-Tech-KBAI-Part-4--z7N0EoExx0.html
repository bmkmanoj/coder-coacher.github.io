similarity earlier in this course when
we were discussing learning by recording
cases at that particular point we came
across the method of K nearest neighbor
at that point we found the nearest
neighbor simply by looking at Euclidean
distance between the new situation and
the family situations we came across the
notion of similarity when we were
discussing case based reasoning as well
at that point we came across at least
two different methods of organizing the
case library and that in one method we
could simply organize all the cases in
array here is an array of several cases
in the domain of navigation in urban
area each case here is represented by
the x and y location of the destination
are different and smarter method was to
organize these cases in a discrimination
tree the leaf nodes of this
discrimination tree represented the
cases the root node and the intermediate
nodes in the discrimination tree
represented discrimination or decisions
about the values of specific features
for example east of 5th Street or not
east of history both of these case
indexing schemes are based on measures
of similarity and the first scheme this
similarity is based on the similarity
between the tags if a new problem were
to come along it will be more or less
similar than one of these cases
depending on whether onyx tags match the
tags of a particular case here in the
second schema to discrimination tree
similarity is based on traversing this
particular tree if a new problem came
along we would use the features of the
new problem Travis history and find the
case who features best match the new
problem note that a new problem and the
source cases in all of this example so
far have been in the same domain here
for example both the new problem in the
source case are in the same domain of
navigating in an urban area in the
previous example the new problem in the
source case was the domain of colored
blocks in the blocks world what happens
if the new problem and the source case
are not in the same domain so consider
the example of a woman walking up the
ladder and and walking up the wall the
two domains are not the same we are
talking about woman in one case and in
another case a ladder in one case of
water another case yet there is some
similarity
situations like this where the new
problem and the source case are from
different domains lead to cross domain
analogies so the question now becomes
how can we find if similarity between
the new problem the target problem and
the source case if they happen to be in
different domains</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
