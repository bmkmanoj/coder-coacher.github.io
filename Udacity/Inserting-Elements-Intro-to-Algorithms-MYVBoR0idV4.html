tell you about is inserting elements
into a heap and that turns out not to be
all that hard but it does involve some
coding that we haven't done yet the idea
is that a new element that we're going
to insert we stick at the very sort of
bottom right corner of the of the heap
or if the heap was already full then the
far left but now we have potentially
violated the heap property so this node
to its parent could be problematic so
essentially we need to do some sort of
an analog of down heapify that I call up
heapify that takes this this value that
might be problematic swaps it up if it
is and and then continues to swap it up
the tree until it reaches a place where
it is smaller than both of its children
at which point the heap property is
satisfied globally so I'm going to leave
that as a homework problem for you to
actually code up up heapify and that
gives us the insert that we need all
right so now that we can insert and
delete into heaps and log in time we can
use this to solve the top-k problem that
we've been talking about throughout this
unit by running through the list of the
N elements that we want the top K of and
meanwhile we keep a heap of size K off
to the side and so we're trying to find
the largest k in this case so each new
element that we encounter we ask is this
element bigger than the smallest value
that we've kept so far so is it does
deserve to be in the top K so far if not
we can just throw it away because we
know it's not going to be part of the
top k if it is then the smallest thing
in that heap no longer needs to be there
because we've found something better so
we delete them in and we insert the new
value that we just got into the tree
sorry into the heap and reestablish the
heap property by well we could do it as
a down heapify actually because we
deleted the note from the top we can
replace it with something else so for
each of n times we do possibly one
insert into the heap which is a log K
operation so the total running time
ends up being we do n log k operations
so that's actually pretty efficient it
doesn't solve the top k problem better
than the randomized algorithm we talked
about the partitioning algorithm but it
does it pretty fast and there's other
uses for this so and we'll see that in
the next unit thanks a lot and good luck
with the homework</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
