for this equation let's see why we know
each of these denominators cannot equal
0 so X cannot equal positive 3 and X
cannot equal negative 3 remember we
don't want these fractions to be
undefined this number would make this
denominator equal to 0 and this number
would also make this denominator equal
to 0 as well this last denominator has
factors of X plus 3 and X minus 3 so
really we've already taken an account
the numbers that X cannot be for it
since we solve these two equations
already if we factor this last
denominator we can see that the LCD
would be X minus 3 times X plus 3 we
know this since this is a factor of this
denominator and this is also a factor of
this denominator next we multiply each
term by the LCD we cancel the factors
that appear in the numerators and in the
denominators we're left with 2 times X
plus 3 for the first term and negative 3
times X minus 3 for the second term our
last term is just negative 12 since
these factors reduce to 1 this is a
linear equation that we're familiar with
we simply want to distribute this 2 and
this negative 3 first and then combine
our like terms and solve for x positive
2x and negative 3x equals negative x and
positive 6 and positive 9 equals
positive 15 make sure you're careful on
this distribution we have negative 3
times negative 3 which equals positive 9
it's really easy to make that sort of
mistake I'm going to rewrite this
equation up here then we subtract 15
from both sides to get negative x is
equal to negative 3 if we multiply
through by a negative 1 positive x would
equal positive 3 but we want to be
careful here we know x equals 3 is an
excluded value it makes this denominator
and this denominator equal to 0 so these
fractions would be undefined since x
equals 3 is an excluded value up here we
know that there's no solution there's no
real number that exists that can satisfy
this equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
