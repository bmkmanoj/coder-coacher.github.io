that they essentially sandboxed in
runtime this means that the apps cannot
directly interfere with the operating
system and other apps nor can they
directly access the device Hardware each
app is granted a set of permissions at
install time and cannot perform
operations that require permissions it
does not have more specifically the
Android platform takes advantage of the
Linux user based protection as a means
of identifying and isolating application
resources the Android system assigns a
unique user ID or UID to each end your
app and runs it as that user in a
separate process the kernel enforces
security between apps and the system at
the process level through standard Linux
facilities such as user and group IDs
that are assigned to the apps by default
apps cannot interact with each other and
apps have limited access to the
operating system if
epee tries to do something malicious
like reading app beast data or dialing
the phone without permission then the
operating system protects against this
because app a does not have the
appropriate user privileges this sandbox
model is simple but on the other hand it
is based on that case all UNIX style
users separation of processes and file
permissions an app can announce the
permissions that he needs and user
approval is required and install time
the permissions are typically become the
permissions are typically implemented by
mapping them to Linux groups they have
the necessary read/write access to
relevant system resources such as files
and sockets and therefore they are
ultimately enforced by the Linux kernel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
