input by polling four at each frame the
other approach to user input is an event
based approach where we ask to be
notified when certain things happen to
do this in libgdx we need to create an
implementation of the input processor
interface and tell libgdx to send events
our way let's check out how we've done
that in this demo we've now declared our
bouncing ball class to extend input
adapter input adapter just like
application adapter and screen adapter
is a convenience implementation of input
processor one of the callback methods of
input processor is keydown which is
called any time a key is pressed the
argument is the key code of the key that
was just pressed in this case we're just
reusing that random kick function and
we'll fire at any time the spacebar is
pressed the return value of all import
processor methods is a boolean
signifying whether the input event was
handled this becomes relevant when
you're dealing with a more complex game
where there might be multiple classes
responding to input events in this case
this is the only class that cares about
input events so we can go ahead and say
that we dealt with the event there's one
more thing we need to do before this
works and that is we need to tell libgdx
that this class is interested in
receiving input events the best place to
do that is back in ball screen where we
use GDX import set input processor
passing in our new ball object let's
give this a try so here's our ball again
and we can grow it and shrink it just
like we did before
and we can also move it around just like
we could before but now if we hit
spacebar it moves and if we hold down
spacebar it doesn't continue to move it
only receives that event when the
spacebar is initially pressed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
