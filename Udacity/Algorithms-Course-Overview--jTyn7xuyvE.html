teaching cs2 15 for Udacity let's go out
on the street and ask people about
social networks are you familiar with
social networks so are you familiar with
social networks yes
do you know what a social network is I
know a little bit my kids use Facebook
I'm not sure what to do with it exactly
I'm not sure I'm I don't know how its
effective throw you a tweet or a tweet e
or a tweeter a tween I think I'm between
no I should probably know before I start
talking unless you just want it you're
already filming oh how many friends do
you have on Facebook and you know
everybody all those people do they're
all I only add people I know how many
friends do you think your dog would have
ah probably more than me so what do you
think a social network is I don't know
really just any type of connection
between two people kind of on a
community level excellent do you think
we have any friends in common probably
not probably not that's what people say
yeah do you think we have any friends in
common I don't know I don't know enough
about you to know that not New Jersey
I'm from New Jersey New Jersey scares me
I know one person who lives in New
Jersey is it me
well yes now I know two actually I know
we are now connected in the social
network acts I don't even know your name
no that's true will you friend me
probably not but like we could name a
single person that both of us know hi
I'm Shannon now we know each other any
friends that we would have in common
I'm gonna guess yes oh so how would we
figure that out we'd start talking me
about like shared interests or shared
work fields and then see if we knew
anyone in the same thing yeah let's just
see where this goes I don't know any
Marianas any connection to New Jersey
ex-boyfriend am i your ex-boyfriend okay
so that's not a connection that we can
make so clearly walking around the
streets talking to random people not a
very efficient way to analyze your
social network for a more efficient way
take CS 2:15 see you there
excuse me can you tell us what you know
about social networks stunned speechless
will have to find someone else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
