pensive yeah just thinking you know to
take a back-end stack for an app is a
huge decision and I'm definitely
convinced that firebase is a good option
given how easy it is to set up but is it
the best option for the project there
are other database solutions out there
you know like I know there's no sequel
sequel solutions there's our goal
there's parse I guess we could even
build our own back-end if we really
wanted to so I'm just kind of wondering
why not any of those other options first
of all firebase consists of a database
and a collection of services which is
sometimes referred to as back-end as a
service let's look at a few other
database options and then compare them
to firebase Oracle and sequel are both
examples of relational databases these
databases are often transaction-based
with rollback functionality they are
generally used for larger enterprise
applications requiring a large number of
read write operations they're not good
choices for shopping list plus plus
because they don't handle real-time
applications natively parse is similar
to firebase and that it is a back-end as
a service it is a no sequel
implementation and uses MongoDB as its
database for shopping list plus plus
it's a better choice but it still
requires third-party support to build
real time applications firebase is also
implemented as a no sequel solution with
the database being one large JSON object
there are no tables or collections or
documents like MongoDB also firebase is
hosted in the cloud which makes it
easier to access data on any client
anywhere in the world finally firebase
gives you complete control for
organizing data and changing your schema
this offers amazing flexibility and is
great for prototyping applications so
well it is possible to build
collaborative mobile applications with
either Oracle or parse it takes
additional planning and requires
additional integration with third-party
Services firebase implementation is
designed from the ground up for
real-time and collaborative applications
like shopping list plus plus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
