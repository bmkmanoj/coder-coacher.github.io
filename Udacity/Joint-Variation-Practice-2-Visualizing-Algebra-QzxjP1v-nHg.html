variations do not both need to be direct
one quantity might have direct variation
while the other might have inverse
variation for example if x and y had
direct variation they would both
increase or they would both decrease and
if Z varied inversely with X then if X
increased Z would have to decrease when
setting up the proportion this means
that since X varies directly with why
they'll be directly across from one
another but since X varies inversely
with Z will see this C quantity in the
denominator we flip this fraction so
let's assume this is still true X is
varying directly with Y and inversely
with Z if the value of x is 10 when y
equals 5 n Z equals 6 I want you to find
the value of x when y is 7 and z is 1 as
a hint this is one case this X could be
10 this y is 5 and the Z is 6 so you try
and filling the other values and then
solve for x and keep in mind in the
setup we had direct variation with y so
this is directly across from each other
whereas we had inverse variation with Z
this C is in the denominator write your
answer for X here you can also think
about we're really finding X to this
value good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
