simplify this term by identifying the
constant factors in it so for those we
have 4 and negative 3 and remember we
want to move those to the front of the
term that they are the first two factors
that we have written this term is equal
to 4 times negative 3 times the variable
factors that we have left over X Y and X
so right off the bat we know how to deal
with two of the factors here we know
that 4 times negative 3 is just equal to
negative 12 so we can replace 4 times
negative 3 with negative 12 and then
write the three remaining factors
there's something interesting here
though we have two variables that are
the same we have X and X I'm going to
rewrite this one more time with the
order of the variables switched so that
the exes are next to each other that's
just generally a good rule of thumb in
algebra is to write things that you
think are related to one another next to
each other this x times X is interesting
this is the first chance that we're
going to get to use exponents we've seen
them already a few times in this course
but we haven't gotten to write our own
factors with exponents in them this may
seem like new material or it may be
review for you but x times X can also be
written with an exponent as X to the
second power in the same way x times X
times X is equal to X to the third and
so on and so forth remember that in all
of these equations right here I didn't
need to write any of these
multiplication signs if we just written
the X is directly next to one another
without any symbol in between
multiplication would still have been
implied so instead we could just have x
x equals x squared I just wrote this out
to be abundantly clear that exponents
show how many of the same factor are
multiplied together incidentally if 2x
is multiplied together is equal to X to
the second power then when we have just
one x its equal to X to the first power
this seems a little bit silly to write
though writing X to the one is more
complicated than writing just X so we
usually don't move from having X to
writing X to the first instead so using
this in from
about exponents we can replace this x
times X with an x squared and with that
information we can rewrite this term as
negative 12x squared Y or obeying all
the conventions we know about how to
write terms because we have the constant
factor at the front and then we have our
variables in ascending alphabetical
order we have the x squared before the Y
that was awesome I know that this was a
pretty complicated thing that involved a
ton of different concepts some of which
we haven't focused on a lot yet but
don't worry exponents still don't feel
totally comfortable we're going to keep
working with them a ton more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
