complexity in algorithms the
introductory theoretical computer
science course from the Georgia Tech
masters and PhD programs on LAN sport
now professor in the school of computer
science at the Georgia Institute of
Technology and I'm Charles Brubaker a
PhD graduate from Georgia Tech and
Udacity course developer in this course
will ask the big questions what is a
computer what are the limits of
computation are the problems that no
computer will ever solve are the
problems that can't be solved quickly
what kinds of problems can we solve
efficiently and how do we go about
developing these algorithms
understanding the power and limitations
of algorithms helps us develop the tools
to make real-world computers smarter
faster and safer we step away from the
particulars of programming languages and
computer architectures instead take an
abstract view of computing this
viewpoint allows us to understand
whether the computational problem is
inherently easy or hard to solve
independent of the specific
implementation or machine we plan to use
these results have stood the test of
time being as viable to us today as they
were when they were developed in the 70s
though the topic of the course is Theory
understanding the material can have very
practical benefits you will learn a
wealth of tools that will help you
recognize when problems you encounter in
the real world are intractable and when
there's an efficient solution this can
save you countless hours that would
otherwise have been spent on a fruitless
endeavor or in reinventing the wheel
certainly by having followed the
rigorous arguments made in this course
you will have given yourself a kind of
training the athlete doesn't just
practice on the field or the court or
the competition is held he goes to the
gym and when he returns he finds he is
better prepared for the game in a
similar way by taking this course you
improve your thinking as you make
engineering or even business decisions
you will find that you have better
reasons to prefer one strategy over
another and will be able to articulate
more rigorous arguments and support of
your ideas shall we get started let's
hit that gym</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
