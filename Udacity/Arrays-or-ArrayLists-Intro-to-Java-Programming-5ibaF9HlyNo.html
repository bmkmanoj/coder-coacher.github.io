and it's a bit of a nuisance that we
have both because it means we have to
make a decision between them whenever we
want to collect elements generally
arraylists are more convenient because
they can grow and shrink but there are a
few reasons why you might want to prefer
a raised first off the syntax with the
brackets is more compact for example
here we assign values 1 2 values 2 and
that's a bit easier to read than the
equivalent with array lists which you
see over here also if you know exactly
what values you want in a collection
then arrays give you an easier syntax
here I have a string of workdays and I
know exactly that I want these five
strings no more no less
I know what they are then I can use this
handy syntax to construct an array and
initialize it right away with an
ArrayList I would have to call the add
method five times once for each of these
strings another disadvantage of array
lists is that they don't work well with
numbers we have never done that so far
but let's say we wanted to collect
numbers in an ArrayList I'd have to do
something like this and when you look
carefully you'll notice that the double
here has an uppercase D normally when we
want to have a floating-point number we
write double with a lowercase T and you
may recall that the number types are not
classes in Java but inside the angle
brackets here I must put in a class an
ArrayList can only collect objects of a
class so for every number type there is
a companion class called the wrapper
class and an object of a wrapper just
has some number inside if you have lots
of numbers say for the sake of the
argument you have a million values it
takes a lot more space to store a
million wrappers each of which contains
a number then it would be to use an
array that contains the numbers directly
most of the time we're not that
concerned about efficiency but when you
are and need to collect a lot of numbers
definitely use an array in conclusion
he's using ArrayList as a rule of thumb
unless you want the nice syntax that an
array gives you you're having the
brackets having the initializers or you
collect lots of numbers
in that case arraylists are quite
inefficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
