of zero meaning it's not seen at all
doesn't mean that that allele isn't
still in the gene pool just floating
around exactly and this brings us back
to the concept of genetic diversity
remember from our pedigrees we learned
that it's not a good idea to keep genes
within a family tree because those
recessive genes that cause recessive
traits right they need other recessive
genes to make those recessive traits
show up and that's going to happen when
the gene pool stay small so that's why
you need to reproduce with people
outside of your immediate family tree to
have more options of genes exactly and
random mating and human travel around
the world is a pretty good job at mixing
and matching these various alleles every
once in a while selection happens and
survival the fitting of cuts out some of
the weaker alleles this definitely
happens but there's a lot of allelic
frequency changes from random selection
events to take these flies buzzing
around as a good example a case in point
before Lauren swatted the Flies there
was roughly fifty percent of one color
versus another color but her hand
indiscriminately killed a lot of the
bugs and now what's left over is
twenty-five percent of one color and
seventy-five percent of another oops
it's okay but this is a great example of
how it was a completely random event the
color of the bug had no bearing on
whether or not the bug died she just
indiscriminately smacked so the change
in frequency is a result of random
selection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
