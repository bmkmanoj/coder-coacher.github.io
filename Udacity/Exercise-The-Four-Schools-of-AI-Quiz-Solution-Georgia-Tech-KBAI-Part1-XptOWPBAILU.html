starting with rumba I would put rumba in
the bottom left
it definitely acts in the world but it
definitely doesn't act like I do it
Criss crosses across the floor until it
vacuums everything up so we're gonna say
that's acting optimally c-3po is fluent
in over six million forms of
communication and that means that it
interacts with humans and other species
very often in order to do that it has to
understand natural sentences and put its
own knowledge back into natural
sentences so it has to act like humans
apple's virtual assistant Siri doesn't
act in the world so she's more on the
thinking into the spectrum but like
c-3po she has to interact with humans
she has to read human sentences and she
has to put her own responses back into
normal vernacular so we're gonna say
that she thinks like humans Google Maps
plots your route from your origin to
your destination so it's definitely
doing thinking it's not doing any acting
in the world but we really don't care if
it does the route planning like we would
do it so we would say it does its route
planning optimally it takes into
consideration traffic current
construction different things like that
whereas we would probably think of the
routes we've taken in the past so Google
Maps thinks optimally there's a good
answer David I agree with you but not
here that some aspects of Siri may well
belong to some of the other quadrants so
putting on the three sounds plausible
but Siri might also be viewed as perhaps
acting when it gives you a response CD
some aspects of Siri might also be
optimal not necessarily like humans so
if you'd like to discuss where these
technologies belong in these spectrums
or perhaps discuss where some other AI
technologies that you're familiar with
belong on these spectrums feel free to
head on over to our forums where you can
bring up your own technologies and
discuss the different ways in which they
fit into the broader school of AI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
