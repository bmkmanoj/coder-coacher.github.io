lookups using a data structure called a
try in a try prefixes are spelled out by
following a path from the root and to
find the best prefix we simply spell out
the address in the try for example let's
suppose we have the following table such
a lookup table has entries of varying
lengths let's see how this might be
encoded in a try in a try spelling out
the bit one always takes us to the right
and spelling out the bit zero always
takes us to the left so to insert one
one one star we basically start here 1 1
1 and then we insert p1 and then we
repeat this process 1 0 star results in
p2 1 0 1 0 results in p3 and 1 0 1 0 1
results in p4 if we want to insert 1 1 1
0 insertion is easy we can simply insert
b5 as such lookups are easy so for
example let's suppose we want to look up
1 0 1 1 1 well all we have to do is
spell this out in the try so we can
follow 1 0 1 and now we see that there's
no entry for 1 0 1 1 so we use the entry
of the last node in the tree that we
Traverse that has an entry in this case
p2 now this structure here is what's
called a single bit try single bit tries
are very efficient note that every node
in this try exists due to one of the 5
forwarding table entries that we've
inserted in the try so a single bit try
is a very efficient use of memory
updates are also very simple we saw how
easy it was to insert the entry for p5
unfortunately the main problem is the
number of memory accesses that are
required to perform a lookup for a 32
bit address we can see that looking up
the address in a single bit try might
require 32 lookups in the worst case one
for each bit since each bit in the
address requires one traversal in the
try or one memory lookup so this could
be very bad at were
thirty two accesses in the worst case to
put this in perspective in OC 48
requires a 160 nanosecond lookup or
simply four memory accesses so 32
accesses is far too many especially for
high-speed links</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
