so right one is the one is an epsilon
one Oh cuz epsilon has to be less than
or equal to half we'd already said that
but you're right in a sense setting
epsilon to one is always a valid answer
to the question find an epsilon such
that we've epsilon exhausted the version
space because all it's saying is that
there's nothing left in the in the set
that has an error greater than one and
since the error is defined to be the
probability it can't be greater than one
so that was kind of you know kind of
rude
I thought I just answered the question
but I guess maybe what you probably
should have pointed out is that I left
out the word smallest oh yes yes okay
well so I don't know the answer to that
but I think I could walk through it very
quickly okay okay so you're saying the
ones that are in green are the training
examples that we see right right so we
should be able to use that to figure out
what the version space actually is right
which we did in a previous question
right although I don't remember okay so
this next one right because the x1
matches it was or an X or mm-hmm
that was it yeah I think that's right
okay so then what we can do is given
that those are the three things that
we've done we could actually compute
what the error is according to this
abuse tribution for each of those three
yes exactly so so let's let's start with
x1 so which one so x1 so all three of
those are going to get the first one and
the third one correct right all of them
are gonna get the first one in the third
one correct yes by design right that's
to be in the version space so now we can
ask which ones will get the second one
wrong the fourth one doesn't matter
because it has zero probability of
showing up that's right so it doesn't
matter if you get this one right or
wrong it's not going to contribute to
this true error measure okay so let's
look at x1 so x1 will in fact get the
second one wrong because the output is
not the same as the value for x1 good
and so what's the probability that X 1
this hypothesis x1 is going to give a
wrong answer on a randomly drawn input
well half the time it will get the
second answer and so the error is in
fact 1/2 yes exactly
good alright let's move on to the or
okay well we can do an easy one acts we
can do X or since we know X or is the
right answer we know it will have a
probability of being wrong of 0 oh good
point okay and so for we can do the same
thing so is we know it's going to get
the first and the third ones right
so now we can ask whether it's going to
get the second one right and zero or one
is in fact true or one so in fact it
also has an error of 0 okay which is
kind of interesting so in it so even
though the function is X or if we can
get to the point where we have or or X
or left we actually will get 0 true
error that's right but in the meantime
because x1 has still survived the two
examples that we have epsilon is
therefore 0.5 right in particular we're
saying that this is if if epsilon were
smaller than 0.5 then it wouldn't be
epsilon exhausted because you'd have a
hypothesis that has error that's too
high so this is the smallest epsilon
that we can use and in fact we let you
through if if it was anything 0.5 to 1
but this is the this is the value that I
was really hoping you'd be able to
reason out ok well that all made sense
good nice work Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
