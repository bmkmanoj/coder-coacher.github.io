NP well remember that we need to show
two things for it to be an NP it needs
to have a short accepting certificate
and it needs to have a fast verification
algorithm in particular what we don't
need to do is actually have a solution
to this problem that's fast we just need
to show that a certificate verification
algorithm is fast so you should by now
have a sense that the certificate in
this case is actually pretty
straightforward if if I tell you that
there's a for click in the graph the way
I can convince you that there's one
there is I'd give you the four nodes
that make up the klique the verification
algorithm then that you run is you go
through all the pairs of nodes in this
in the certificate and make sure that in
the original graph G they're actually
connected so for each one you just have
to ask the question okay is this pair an
edge in the graph it's this parent edge
in the graph and that each of those
tests takes unit time constant time and
there's order big theta of k squared
pairs to check so this verification
algorithm runs in polynomial time
so just to drive this point home now for
every graph G that has a cake leak there
is a certificate that would cause the
verification algorithm to say yes but
for any graph G that doesn't have a cake
cleat there's no certificate you can
give it that would cause this
verification algorithm to say yes and
just to make certain here the
verification algorithm could also check
to see that the certificate that you
gave it actually consists of K nodes you
know just to be careful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
