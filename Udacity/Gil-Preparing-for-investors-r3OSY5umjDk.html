fundraising process every founder need
to speak to other founders that have
gone through the process learn from them
about their experiences the do's and
don'ts and what worked and what didn't
it's really about having a few things
ready when you kick off the process hey
you need the materials you need the deck
you need any Excel financials everything
that you can that sort of you can share
with an investor at the right time
seconding to practice your pitch the
pitch is not you know twenty-second
converse 20-minute conversation it's
really being able to tell your story
succinctly in an effective way and for
that you need to practice a lot and
finally you need to really figure out
who it is you're pitching what type of
investors are you looking for who are
