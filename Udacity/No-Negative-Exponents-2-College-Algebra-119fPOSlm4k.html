this negative exponent factor is
separated out from the rest of the
factors so I'm just going to multiply a
little bit more explicitly so we have 3
m squared times 1 over N to the negative
4 however we know that we have a
negative exponent n to the negative 4 in
our case this factor is actually equal
to 1 over n to the fourth so i need to
replace just the denominator of this
fraction right here with this number so
that's going to give us 3 m squared
times 1 over 1 over n to the fourth this
is really not looking very pretty
however we know how to handle this
dividing by a fraction is the same as
multiplying by its reciprocal so for
example we have 1 over a over B that's
just equal to 1 times B over a so we can
continue modifying this expression using
that trick this is going to equal
keeping the 3 M Squared we keep the
numerator here and we multiply by the
reciprocal of the denominator so the
reciprocal of 1 over n to the fourth is
just n to the fourth over 1 well now
this is easy you know that anything x 1
is just itself let me know that anything
divided by 1 is just itself so this
leaves us with three M Squared and to
the fourth so again we see that's
switching the sign of an exponent so
switching from negative for two positive
for here for the factor with the n bass
just requires a flipping of the exponent
sign and a flipping of the side of the
equation that factors on we switch from
having and to the negative fourth in the
denominator having end the positive
fourth in the numerator if you found
working with fractions like this a
little bit difficult not a big deal at
all just take some time to review a
manipulation of fractions with the
materials that we've directed you to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
