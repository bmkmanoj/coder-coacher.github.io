transfer so given this target problem
analogical retrieval has led to this
source case given a model of the target
problem and a model resource case and
illogical mapping has also occurred
correspondence has been established thus
we now know that the King corresponds to
the tumor not at the patient and if the
rebel army corresponds to a laser beam
for the source case we also know the
solution the rebel army divided itself
into smaller groups and the smaller
groups all arrived at the fort at the
same time now the question becomes how
can we transfer this solution to our
original target problem from the source
case now we're inducing a pattern of
relationships a strategy in this case
the pattern is that if there is a goal
capturing the king and a resource the
rebel army under obstacle between the
resource and the goal the mines on the
road Lin decompose the resource into
several smaller resources and send them
to the goal from different directions at
the same time this abstract pattern is
now transferred to the target problem
and instantiate it because we know that
the go to the tumor the resource of the
laser gun and the obstacle is the
healthy tissue we know what to do we
must decompose the resource the laser
gun into smaller pieces smaller less
intense laser beams and send them to the
tumor the goal at the same time from
different directions this is how we can
transfer the problem solving strategy
from this source case to the target
problem note that this transfer depended
upon the correct mapping the correct
alignment between the target problem in
the source case which in turn depended
upon the retrieval of the source case
corresponding to this target problem not
the important role of goal here the goal
was to capture the king so this is an
example of pragmatic similarity with a
lot of similarities the level of the
goal captain in the King curing the
tumor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
