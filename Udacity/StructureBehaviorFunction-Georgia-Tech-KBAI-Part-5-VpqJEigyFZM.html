help capture both divisible levels of
abstraction structure for example and
the invisible levels like behavior and
function therefore these models are
sometimes called structure behavior
function let's take a simple example all
of us are familiar with the household
flashlight you press on the button and
light comes out of the bulb what you can
see is the button and the bulb and the
body of the flashlight you can even open
the body of the flashlight and you might
see some batteries inside your
flashlight that's all you can see but of
course there is more going on here to
begin with this particular flashlight as
a function this function is invisible
you can ascribe to it but it's nowhere
inside the body of the bulb one level at
which it is used tool to analyze the
flashlight is to ask ourselves what does
it do not yet how does it work just what
does it do its function here is a
representation of the function here is a
function create light of that lightbulb
circuit or the flashlight right web
circuit there is some stimulus some
external force on the switch initially
there was no light zero humans and
finally there is some light 30 lumens
this captures the notion that when I
press on the switch light comes out here
is a representation of this structure of
the flashlight here is a light bulb this
switch and the battery and they are
connected all of them are attached here
is the invisible causal process that
we're calling behavior will capture this
behavior through a series of states and
transitions between these states so here
is electricity initially in the battery
then in this electricity flows from the
battery to the bulb and then the bulb
converts this electricity into light but
in order for this electricity to flow
through the bulb this particular switch
has to be any mode on the switch goes
into the mode on when someone presses on
it electricity is converted light
because that's the function of the bulb
notice that is sbf models are nested we
just give an SP of model of the
flashlight circuit but now if you want
we can either the SP of model the light
bulb itself how does it create light in
this way structure behavior
function models captured not just
visible structure but also the invisible
causal processes the behaviors and the
functions moreover they capture there at
multiple levels abstraction at the level
of the flashlight in the level of the
bulb and so on we are not describe it in
detail here the structural behavior
function models and other similar models
enables systems thinking in the context
of diagnosis and design of complex
systems we provided some readings about
us in the course materials if you want
to read more about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
