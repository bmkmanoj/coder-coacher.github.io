and what workflow actions are are simply
the things that are going to you know
fire as soon as that criteria is met
can we add an email yeah let's do that
this is going to email our technician
it's gonna immediately email them if a
records created and they have an email
so description can be email technician
yep
email template so what's that for
so in Salesforce you can create email
templates that use merge fields similar
to what we've already seen in our
formulas okay and so it auto populates
with fields off of that object so you
could say something like dear Bob
technicians name yeah okay that's pretty
cool um and have you kindly made this
template already I have thank you Sam
yeah so pick the maintenance
notification not the solution okay and
recipient type what's this all about so
we can dynamically assign who the
recipient is based off of you know maybe
they're part of a queue and we wanted to
go to a maintenance queue or maybe they
have a specific role and so we're trying
to dynamically determine who should
receive it by role okay
but in this case we can use the related
user which is the mobile technician that
we have associated with the record so
related you say check machine yeah then
from Kearney uses email sounds find me
yeah and safe sounds good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
