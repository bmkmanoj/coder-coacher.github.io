in the lesson but it's worthwhile to
explore them in some more depth we say
that two vectors are parallel if one is
a scalar multiple of the other so if V
is a vector then V and 2v are parallel
as our V and one half V as our V and
minus V in fact since the zero vector
equals zero times V it follows that V
and the zero vector are parallel to also
it's worth noting that V is parallel to
itself since one times V equals V note
that we consider two vectors to be
parallel even if they point in opposite
directions such as the case of the and
minus V all that matters is that we can
multiply one by scalar to get the other
in contrast we say two vectors are
orthogonal if their dot product is zero
recall that if V dot W equals zero then
there are two possible cases either one
of the vectors V or W is the zero vector
or else they're at right angles to each
other this is where we get the
terminology orthogonal orthogonality is
sometimes difficult to imagine in higher
dimensions so this algebraic definition
comes in handy when we lose our ability
to picture our vectors an interesting
fact is that the zero vector has the
unique property that it is parallel and
orthogonal to all other vectors in fact
the zero vector is the only vector that
is orthogonal to itself to see why
suppose that V is a vector sum vector
maybe not zero but it has the property
that it's orthogonal to itself that
means that v dot v equals zero but
recall that V V equals the magnitude of
V squared so that means the magnitude of
v square equals zero in turn that means
that the magnitude of V equals zero
since the zero vector is the only vector
with zero magnitude that means the zero
vector is the only vector that V could
possibly be so if some vector is
orthogonal to itself it must be the zero
vector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
