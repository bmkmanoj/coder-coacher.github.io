places it appears in the definition of a
function and it can appear in a function
call in the definition of a function
what it means is this function can take
any number of arguments and they should
all be joined up into a tuple called
args so if the call to the function
looked like this something of F 1 2 3
then 1 2 3 would be bound up into a
tuple and assigned to art so within the
body of something args is equal to the
tuple 1 2 3 and then this part here
means take that tuple and apply it not
as a single argument but rather unpack
it and apply it to all those arguments
so function of star args is equivalent
to writing function of 123 so it's just
a way of packing and unpacking arguments
with respect to function calls now one
thing I want you to notice here is that
we use the function as a variable as a
parameter or something that's passed
into another function we're using the
the property of Python that functions
are first class objects just like
integers and lists and everything else
functions are objects that you can pass
around that's very powerful because that
way we can control both what happens and
when it happens the idea here is that we
want to call this function we want to
delay calling of the function until
we've already started the clock we want
it to happen between the time we start
the clock and the time we end the clock
and in order to do that if we try to
write something like this time call of
the result of calling zebra puzzle then
time call wouldn't work it would be too
late because what we'd asked a time call
would be the result of zebra puzzle we
don't want to pass the result we want to
pass the function that we're going to
call and be able to delay execution of
that function until the right time until
we're ready to set the clock and so
functions allow us to do that to delay
execution until later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
