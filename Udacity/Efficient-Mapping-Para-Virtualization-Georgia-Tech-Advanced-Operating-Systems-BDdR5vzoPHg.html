other hand the operating system knows
that its physical memory is not
contiguous and therefore this burden of
efficient mapping can be shifted into
the guest operating system itself so now
the guest operating system is going to
maintain contiguous physical memory it
makes it simpler in terms of all the
other subsystems to do that but it is
also going to know that its notion of
physical memory is not the same as
machine memory and so it will map the
discontiguous
physical memory to real Hardware pages
so that burden of doing the PPN to MPN
mapping can be pushed into the guest
operating system in a para virtualized
setting so on an architecture like Intel
where the page table is a data structure
of the operating system and it is also
used by the hardware to do the address
translation the responsibility of
allocating and managing the hardware
page table data structure can be shifted
into the guest operating system in a
fully virtualized setting it's not
possible to do that because the
operating system in a fully virtualized
setting is unaware of the fact that it
is not running on bare metal but in a
para virtualized setting since it is
possible to do that it is more efficient
to push this efficient mapping handling
into the guest operating system for
example in Xen which is a para
virtualized hypervisor it provides a set
of hyper calls for the guest operating
system to tell the hypervisor about
changes to the hardware page table so
for instance there is a call that says
create page table and this allows a
guest operating system to allocate and
initialize a page frame that it has
previously acquired a real page frame
that it has previously acquired from the
hypervisor has a hardware resource it
can target
that physical page frame as a page table
data structure recall that each guest
operating-system would have gotten a
bunch of physical memory from the
hypervisor at the beginning of
establishing its footprint on the
hypervisor and so it can use one of
those real physical memories to host a
page table data structure on behalf of a
new process that it launched just now so
anytime a new process starts up in the
guest operating system the guest
operating system will make a hyper call
to Zen saying please create a page table
for me and this is the page frame that
I'm giving you to use as the page table
so when the guest operating system has
to run this particular process which
just got launched then it can make
another hyper call to the hypervisor and
saying please switch the page table and
here it is the location of the page
table the hypervisor doesn't know about
these processes all it understands is
that there's a hyper call that says
change the page table from whatever it
used to be to this new page table and
that essentially results in this guest
operating system switching the address
space of the currently running process
on the bare Hardware on the bare metal
to p1 by this switch page table hyper
call Zen will do the appropriate thing
of setting the hardware register of the
processor to point to this page table
data structure in response to this hyper
call from the guest operating system if
the process p1 were to page fault at
some point of time the page fault would
be handled by the guest operating system
we'll talk about how it does that later
on but once it handles that page fault
for p1 and says oh this particular
virtual page of this process is now
going to correspond to a physical frame
that I own I'm going to tell the
hypervisor that the mapping in the page
table has to be set for this translator
that I just established for the faltered
page for this process so there is
another hyper call that's available for
updating a given page table data
structure and using this the guest
operating system can deal with
modifications to the page table data
structure all the things that an
operating system would have to do in a
normal setting on bare metal you have to
be able to do in the setting where you
have the hypervisor sitting between the
real hardware and the guest operating
system and the three things that are
required to be done in the context of
memory management in a pair of virtual
die setting is being able to create a
brand-new hardware address space for a
newly launched process which involves
creating a page table that's a hyper
call that's available when you do a
context switch you want to switch the
page table that's a hyper call that's
available when you do a conflict switch
in the guest operating system from p1 to
p2 the guest can tell the hypervisor
that the page table to use from now on
as such and so that's the way the guests
can do a context switch from one process
to another and thirdly since not all of
the address space or the memory
footprint of a process will be in
physical memory if the currently running
process were to incur a page fault that
has to be handled by the guest operating
system and handling that it establishes
a mapping between the missing virtual
page for this process and the physical
frame in which the contents of that page
is now contained that mapping has to be
put into the page table for this
particular process again that's
something that only the hypervisor can
do because it is a privileged operation
happening inside the hardware and for
that purpose the hypervisor provides a
hyper call that allows a guest operating
system to update the page table data
structure so the outside has said
they're handling virtual memory is the
thorny issue doing the mapping from
virtual to physical on every memory
access without the intervention
of the guest operating system is the key
to good performance and it can be done
both in fully virtualized
and para virtualized sitting by the
tricks that we talked about just now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
