principle and parallel programming and
indeed in all the computer science we
call that principle I'm Dells law the
total speed up you get is limited by the
portion of the time you spend doing
something that can be parallelized in
the limit of enough parallelism you know
doing a good enough job with parallelism
having a parallel enough machine your
maximum speed up goes to 1 over 1 over P
where P is defined as the percentage or
portion of parallelizable times time
spent on this parallel visible activity
so it's really important that you know
these limits so for example if your
application spends fifty percent of its
time on Io is reading and writing to the
disk that implies that you can't
possibly do better than a 2x speed up
unless that is you can come up with a
way to refactor the computation for
example maybe you can read and write
larger batches of data at once so that
the GPU has more work to do on a single
batch and I want to say this this
situation comes up pretty often in
practice right GPUs are so fast that
often porting the hot spot to cuda makes
that hot spot so much faster that's no
longer the bottleneck and that's why I
made the point earlier that if you have
a bunch of functions you might need to
do more than port a single hot spot to
the GPU right you might find that after
you've ported that first hot spot to the
GPU it's gotten so much faster that now
you need to focus somewhere else and
remember once you've once you've crossed
this point there's little point in
continuing to optimize this the total
time on your application is not going to
go down very much if you continue to
work on this this hot spot you need to
shift your attention to the new
bottlenecks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
