problems let's try a mixture one mixture
problems like this are helpful if you're
at home and you want to make lemonade or
punch usually you're trying to make a
different concentration than what you
already have in your fridge scientists
also use this approach when they're
trying to make different concentrations
of chemical solutions in the laboratory
let's see how it works let's use the
same approach as before with rates and
amounts to try and set up equations the
word is is slightly different here
because we're working with volumes and
percentages but I think you'll see a
pattern for this problem we have five
gallons of a punch mix with sixty five
percent water we want to mix it with a
punch mix that's eighty percent water so
that way we get a mix that's
seventy-five percent water in the end
the question is how much of this eighty
percent mixture should we use these are
the two equations that we're going to
try and set up the first one takes into
account the gallons of water for example
the first volume that I have is five
gallons of punch mix this punch mix is
sixty-five percent water so if i take my
percentage of water and multiply it by
the gallons of punch I'll get my gallons
of water I change sixty-five percent to
its decimal and multiply by 5 to get
three and a fourth or three and 25
hundredths remember the question can
help us identify the variable we don't
know how much punch mix we need that's
eighty percent so I'm going to let that
variable B X using X and the information
in the problem I want you to complete
our equation what should go in these
boxes don't worry about volume three we
actually don't know that quantity yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
