simple enough and you can look at the
documentation page for more details in
this exercise the code is set up so that
the scene is lit by only ambient
lighting it's quite flat as you can see
in in details lost what I want you to do
is turn off the ambient lighting and
replace it with what I call a headlight
think of it as a minor's like something
you put on your head to look around in
the dark instead of a flat ambient light
you have a light that is guaranteed to
illuminate everything you see since it's
located wherever you are if you search
for the word headlight in the code
you'll see where you need to modify
things there are two things you'll need
to do the first is to add the proper
type of light to the fill scene method
using the headlight variable which I've
declared at the top of the code for you
declaring it at the top makes this
variable usable in any of the methods in
the code make the headlight a full white
color and intensity of 1.0 the second
task is to make the lights position
always match that of the camera for
every frame if you look in the render
method you'll see this code this method
is called every time a new images to be
rendered don't worry about the Delta and
the camera control calls leave those
alone the key line here is the render
objects render call this call is what
actually renders the scene what you want
to do is to make the headlights position
match the cameras position before
rendering by doing so the headlight will
then shine on everything visible bathing
it with illumination the surfaces then
are not all the same dull solid ambient
color but have some definition to them
which looks more realistic both the
light and the camera are derived from
object 3d so you can access the position
of both of these in the same way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
