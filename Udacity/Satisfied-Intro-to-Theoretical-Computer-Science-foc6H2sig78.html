representation of boolean formulas in
Python that we're going to be using to
then write a function is satisfied that
checks whether a given boolean formula
and a given assignment of true false
values to that boolean formula or rather
to the variables in that boolean formula
satisfies it so first we have a variable
num variables which is simply the number
of variables that are in the boolean
formula the number of distinct variables
that is the boolean formula itself is
represented as a list of Lists where
each inner list is a clause for example
this inner list is the clause x1 or x2
or not x3 and you can see that the
variables that are negated are negative
this clause would be x2 or not x 4 and
this clause is not x1 or x3 or x4 and
then of course each individual clause
would be ended together assignment is a
list of well true/false assignments to
the individual variables note that Simon
has one more element in it than the
number of variables then the first one
is actually just a placeholder it
doesn't do anything we're only concerned
with the second element through the end
of the list now if we have these
individual assignments variables and
then we print is satisfied of these we
can see that it returns true this is a
satisfied boolean formula or rather this
boolean formula is satisfied by this
assignment where x1 is true x2 is true
x3 is true and x4 is true and if you run
seep through this and check you'll see
that that is in fact the case now if we
change assignment to true false true
true and we can see that this assignment
does not satisfy the boolean formula and
returns false so your job is to write B
is satisfied function to fill in the
body of the function so that it
correctly interprets whether a boolean
formula is satisfied by a given
assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
