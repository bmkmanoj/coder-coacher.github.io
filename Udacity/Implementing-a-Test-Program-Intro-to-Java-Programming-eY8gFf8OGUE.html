tricky problems with Sara and maybe the
results of the programs were not always
what you expected that's why it's such a
good idea to test your programs to see
that they produced the right result
testing is incredibly important in
software engineering and when testing
isn't done right the results can be
quite dramatic over here you see the
liftoff of a rocket and Ariane rocket of
the European Space Agency that
unfortunately a few seconds afterwards
explodes in midair now what happened
here is that the rocket had a device to
maintain its position and it actually
had two backups and because of that the
rocket engineers didn't think they had
to test it but both backups failed for
the exact same reason actually and
testing really would have been
beneficial in this case so let's learn
more about how you can test your own
programs okay here we are in bluej
and I'm going to write a program that
tests the translate method of rectangles
let's have a look here we construct a
rectangle we call the translate method
we print out what happens to the
x-coordinate and we also print out what
happens to the width of the rectangle
and now for the important part the
important part is that before compiling
the program we also think what should it
do and it is really really important
that you think about that right when you
write your test program here is a super
easy way of doing that you simply add a
print statement that prints what you
expect that this program should do hmm
what do we expect let's see the
x-coordinate of the rectangle is at five
the y-coordinate is a 10 and now we
translate it by 25 pixels to the right
and 15 pixels down so we have five
translated by 25 pixels so we expect
that the x-coordinate is now 30 pixels
and that's what I'm putting here what
about the width the width is 60 and
moving the rectangle shouldn't change it
so we're expected to be 60 again so this
is a good example of a tester program we
do something we print the results and we
print the expected result let's quickly
run the program we have the actual
exposition of 30 and the expected
position of 30 and similarly we have the
actual width of 60 and the expected
widths of 60 so the actual and the
expected matchup that's great so the
simple lesson is always print the actual
and the expected results sarah has an
activity where you can write your own
test program and practice this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
