I want to talk about is integration
testing integration testing refers to
taking multiple software modules that
have already been unit tested and
testing them in combination with each
other at this point often what we're
really testing is the interfaces between
modules and the question is did we
define them tightly enough and specify
them tightly enough but the different
people or the different groups of people
implementing the different modules were
able to make compatible assumptions
which is necessary for the module
software modules to all actually work
together and it often turns out that
during integration testing we find
substantial differences of assumption
they have to be resolved before we can
create a reliable integration of the
individual parts and so as a computer
science professor what I find is that
groups of students are almost always
successful at creating well tested
reliable software modules but that
separate groups of students who
individually create software modules
even when implementing to a fairly tight
specification often create software
modules that fail under integration
testing there's really something that's
quite a lot harder to do come up with
software modules that survive
integration testing is really quite a
lot harder often than creating reliable
small units</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
