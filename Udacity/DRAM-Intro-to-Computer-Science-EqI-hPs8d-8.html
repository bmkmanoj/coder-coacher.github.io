these actually look like and my wife was
kind enough to let me take some parts
out of her computer actually she took
them out of the computer so I could show
you what they look like
this is DRAM this is two gigabytes of
DRAM and what a gigabyte means is
approximately a billion bytes what it
actually means I'll show you in the
Python interpreter so in Python we can
do exponentiation by using star star
this is what we would write
mathematically as 2 to the power 10 so 2
to the power 10 is a thousand 24 this is
called the kilobyte we use the prefixes
like the thousand prefixes but the
actual values in computing are usually
powers of two instead so they're a
little bit different than a thousand
it's really a thousand 24 when we talk
about a kilobyte and a megabyte is a
thousand twenty-four kilobytes that's
equivalent to 2 to the power 20 so a
megabyte is just over a million bytes a
gigabyte is 2 to the power 30 which is
just over a billion bytes and a terabyte
is 2 to the power 4 which is just over a
trillion bytes so these are the main
units we're going to talk about when we
think about memory so here we have 2
gigabytes of memory so that means we
have 2 to the 30 that would be one
gigabyte we have 2 to the 30 times 2
which is 2 gigabytes times 8 which is
the number of bits in a byte and one bit
is the equivalent to a light switch it
can be in one of two states so with one
byte we have the equivalent of eight
light switches so this is comparable to
having 17 billion light switches the
kind of memory that we have here is
actually DRAM so it's really more like
having 17 billion buckets and that means
when you turn your computer off
everything that's stored in the DRAM is
lost to keep the memory here it's like a
bucket but instead of storing water it's
storing electrons as a capacitor and
when the power goes off that memory is
lost there are many different types of
memory inside your computer I mentioned
registers briefly that's the fastest
memory that is built right into the
processor the main things that matter
that distinguished the memory that you
have is the
latency which is the time it takes to
get a response so the latency you can
think of as the time to retrieve the
value from memory we'll talk about
latency more next class in terms of what
that means in networks which is really
the same thing for this DRAM the latency
is about 12 nanoseconds and as a
reminder a nanosecond is one billionth
of a second the other thing that really
distinguishes memory and the reason we
have so many different types of it is
the cost the cost varies depending on
mostly the latency and the amount of
memory you can store the cost for this
memory if you bought it today is about
$10 for two gigabytes that's ten US
dollars about seven euros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
