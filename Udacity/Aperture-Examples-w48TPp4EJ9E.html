bunch of examples on how the change of
just the aperture itself can change the
look and feel of an image we saw that
for changes of shutter speed where we
show motion blur and streaks of light
let's start off with completely of
course a closed aperture of course I'm
showing a white doesn't mean it should
be completely black there's no light
entered but let's look at as soon as I
open the aperture what kind of images I
get so this is an opening of F over 3.5
so the end number is 3.5 these are my
three friends again and actually
hopefully you can see this and we'll be
putting these images up for you to look
at more carefully also online much more
crisper you can actually see the beard
and stuff but here things start getting
blurry
in fact my dear friend Einstein is
almost out of focus here this effect is
sometimes also known as shallow
depth-of-field and sometimes it's
intentionally done by photographers
because they want to focus more on the
front person and not actually pay
attention to the people behind so look
at this waz here of course you can't
tell much detail of this one let's now
start changing the aperture values I've
closed the aperture a little bit now
we're at F 4.0 might be hard to tell but
things have gone a little bit more in
focus at the back now you should be able
to tell a little bit more difference
here again now we're 5.6 smaller
aperture here actually you should be
able to see a little bit more detail we
are at f/8 much smaller aperture you can
actually start seeing his hair and mr.
Einstein has gotten a little bit more on
focus and you can actually start seeing
the wires and all the include
intricacies off this was right here the
trees are also getting a little bit more
in focus back then moving to f11
increased focus again smaller aperture
f-14 now here you should be able to see
a lot more detail getting much and much
crisper and in fact this is and this is
pretty much the same kinds of Christmas
and sharpness is a little bit more
blurred but let's see what we can do
with it next by f-18 very small aperture
much more crisper here you actually can
see the Oise and more
detail the tree the leaves are much
clearer and the whole thing seems to be
a little bit more full and focus and
there seems to be no you know shallow
depth-of-field kind of stuff back there
gone taken it to f-22 much more crisper
just to help to visualize this I'm gonna
just show you three different ones here
3.5 very blurry f11 less blurry trees
and focus just reaching back for you to
see what it was before forward let's go
one more f-22 twice and of course less
light is coming in for various reasons
yes we are keeping the shutter open
longer but that's not the point here the
point is I'm showing the effects just of
this kind of stuff you see that this is
much more in focus just looking at it
closely again next to each other these
are the two differences wider smaller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
