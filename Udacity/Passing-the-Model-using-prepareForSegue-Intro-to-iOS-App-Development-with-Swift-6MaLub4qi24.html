playing thus far in record sounds view
controller we have a function called
audio recorder did finish recording and
inside this function what we are doing
is saving the recorded audio by the way
we are tracking two things about the
audio its file path and its title now
even though we are saving the recorded
audio we're not quite passing it from
the first scene to the second if we want
to play the sounds in the second new
controller we need to pass this data to
the second scene let's do that next now
to do this I will go back to record
sounds view controller and introduce you
to another function that we inherit from
uiviewcontroller
it's called prepare for segue and as I
start to type it Xcode autocompletes it
for me
this function prepared for segue it gets
called just before a segue is about to
be performed and therefore is a great
place to pass any data in here I will
add an if statement and check to see if
my segue identifier is stop recording
now this type of a check becomes really
important when we have multiple segues
connected to the same view controller
alright to pass data to this second view
controller we somehow need a way to
access it in code and I can do that
with this line here I created a constant
called play sounds VC and then defined
its appropriate type and then used
segues destination view controller
property to get a handle on the second
view controller in our app I also use
the as keyword in Swift to convert this
destination view controller to the
correct type we are expecting which is
play sounds view controller okay so now
that we have a way to access play sounds
view controller in code let's think
about how we are going to pass data to
it we can get our data from this sender
parameter remember that sender is the
object that initiated the segue which in
our case was recorded audio so I can
write a line of code like this to
retrieve the data so now I just need to
pass this data to play sounds view
controller but wait this guy play sounds
view controller it doesn't really have a
way of receiving any data just yet does
it so to fix this what I will do is go
to play sounds view controller
from the navigator and create a new
variable called received audio now this
variable is of type recorded audio this
was the new class we created now if you
go back to prepare for segue I can pass
the data in this manner I can say play
sounds view controller dot received
audio this is the new variable we
created and play sounds view controller
this is now equal to data cool let's run
this project all right let me record
something is the app working now let me
play the sound my mom always said life
with lack a box of chocolates hmm the
app is still playing a movie quote
clearly guess why that is happening
