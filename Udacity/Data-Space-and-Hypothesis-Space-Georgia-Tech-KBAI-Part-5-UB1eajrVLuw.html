from a data space to a hypothesis space
in case of medical diagnosis the data
may be the various kind of science and
symptoms that I might go to a doctor
with some of the data may be very
specific some of it may be very abstract
an example of very specific data is that
Ashok's temperature is 104 degrees
Fahrenheit an example of an abstraction
of the data is that Ashok is running a
fever your hypothesis base consists of
all hypotheses that can explain parts of
the observed data a hypothesis in the
hypothesis space can explain some part
of the data in case of medicine this
hypothesis may refer to diseases a
doctor may say that my hypothesis is
that Ashok is suffering from flu and
that explains his high fever in the
domain of car repairs this hypothesis
may refer to specific Falls with a car
for example the carburetor is not
working properly
in the domain of computer software this
hypothesis may refer to specific methods
not working properly now this mapping
from data space to the hypothesis space
can be very complex the complexity
arises partly because of the size of the
data space partly because the size of
the hypothesis space partly because the
mapping can be m2n and also because this
hypothesis can interact with each other
if a ch3 is present that 4 may be
excluded if I was present at 6 is sure
to be present and so on
it helps then not to deal with all the
raw data but to deal with abstractions
of the data so the initial data that a
patient may go to a doctor with may be
very very specific the signs and
symptoms of that particular specific
patient but the diagnostic process may
abstract them from Ashok has a fever of
104 degrees Fahrenheit - Ashok has a
high fever this abstract data then can
be mapped into an abstract hypothesis
Ashok has high fever can get mapped into
a shook has a viral infection for
example that abstract hypothesis can now
be refined into Ashok suffers from flu
or Ashok suffers from flu for particular
strain at the end we want a hypothesis
that is as refined as possible and that
explains all the available data when we
were talking about class
vacation we talked about to process of
classification bottom-up process and a
top-down process the bottom-up process
of classification will start with raw
data and then grouped and obstructed it
in case of top-down classification we
started with some high-level class and
then established it and refined it you
can see that in diagnosis both the
bottom-up process of classification and
the top-down process of classification a
co-occurring this method of bottom-up
classification in the data space mapping
into the hypothesis space and then
problem classification in the hypothesis
space is called heuristic classification
this is yet another method like
rule-based reasoning case based
reasoning and moral based reasoning with
the diagnostic task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
