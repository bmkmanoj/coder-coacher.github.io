iverson of the abstract behavioral spec
implemented ready to run but it is
unoptimized remember that its component
based design there going to be a lot of
cruft that is going to be there in terms
of the interfaces between the components
that have been assembled together to
build a complex system one word of
caution though I mentioned that using
IOA Tomita is fantastic from the point
of view of proving that the properties
that we want in the original subsystem
is actually met by the behavioral spec
that is facilitated by the i/o automata
framework but this path that we took
going from the abstract to the concrete
behavioral spec to the implementation
finally ending up with this unoptimized
version which is executable there is no
guarantee that this an optimised version
of code that we produced is actually
meeting this behavioral spec in other
words this leg of the design exercise
proving properties of the spec that it
meets what we set out for the original
subsystem is in no way guaranteeing that
those properties are actually in the
implementation there's no easy way to
show that the oh camel implementation is
the same as the IO IO automata
specification this brings to mind a
famous quote that is attributed to Don
Knuth many of you may know him as an
expert in algorithm development he's
written several books on it and the
quote that is attributed to him is
beware of bugs in the above code I've
only proved it correct not tried it so
in other words he's an is an expert in
developing algorithms but he's saying
any convert the algorithm to code there
is no way to prove that that code is
actually faithfully to producing the
algorithm and that's sort of the same
thing that is going on here as well that
we have an abstract behavioral spec we
can prove properties about this
behavioral spec and be convinced that
whatever we set out for the subsystem is
actually met in terms of the
specification but there's no way to
prove that this implementation is
actually faithfully reproducing the
behavioral spec this is the software
engineering roadmap for
synthesizing a complex system starting
from the behavioral spec all the way to
an unemployment ation of the system so
those are the first two pieces of the
puzzle namely specification and then
implementation and the third piece of
the puzzle of course is going from this
unoptimized version to the optimized
version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
