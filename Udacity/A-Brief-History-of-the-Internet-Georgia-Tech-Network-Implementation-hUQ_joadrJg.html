history the internet the Internet has
its roots in the ARPANET which was
conceived in 1966 to connect big
academic computers together the first
operational our Pinet nodes came online
in 1969 at UCLA SR I UCSB and Utah
around the same time the National
Physical Laboratory in the UK also came
online by 1971 there are about 20
ARPANET nodes and the first host-to-host
protocol there were two cross country
links and all of the links were at 50
kbps here is a rough sketch of the
ARPANET as drawn by Larry Roberts in the
late 1960s and you can see the four
original nodes here as well as some
other well-known players such as Berkley
the Mac project at MIT BBN Harvard
Carnegie Mellon Michigan Illinois
Dartmouth Stanford and so forth
this is what the ARPANET looked like in
the late 1960s here's a picture of the
ARPANET in June 1974 and you can see not
only some additional networks that have
come online but also a diagram of the
machines that are connected at each of
the universities you can also see a
connection here between the ARPANET and
NPL net of course the ARPANET wasn't the
only network there were other networks
at the time sat net operated over
satellite there were packet radio
networks and there are also Ethernet
local area networks work started in 1973
on replacing the original network
control protocol with tcp/ip where IP
was the internetwork protocol and TCP
was the transmission control protocol
TCP IP was ultimately standardized from
1978 to 1981 and included in Berkeley
UNIX in 1981 and on January 1st 1983 the
internet had one of its flag days where
the ARPANET transitions to tcp/ip now
the internet continued to grow but the
number of computers on the Internet
really didn't start to take off until
the mid 90s you can see here that around
August 1995
five there were about 10 million hosts
on the Internet and five years later
there was an order of magnitude more
hosts on the Internet more than a
hundred million during this period the
internet experienced a number of
technical milestones in 1982 the
internet saw the rollout of the domain
name system which replaced the hosts txt
file containing all the world's machine
names with a distributed name lookup
system 1988 saw the rollout of TCP
congestion control after the Nets
suffered a series of congestion
collapses 1989 saw the NSFNET and BGP
inter-domain routing including support
for routing policy the 90s on the other
hand saw a lot of new applications in
approximately 1992 we started to see a
lot of streaming media including audio
and video the web was not soon after in
1993 which allowed users to browse a
mesh of hyperlinks the first major
search engine was Alta Vista which came
online in December of 1995 and
peer-to-peer protocols and applications
including file sharing began to emerge
around 2000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
