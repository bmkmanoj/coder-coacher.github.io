PhD student at Berkeley and she works on
the theory of computation so what are
you working on so lately I've been
working in a computational economics
which is this you know exciting thing
that really Berkeley focuses on so
looking at problems that economists face
and see whether or not we can develop
algorithms and ways to solve this so
particularly the thing that I've been
working on has been computational social
choice and so social choice functions
are ones that aggregate people's
preferences so you think about this as a
voting mechanism so everybody gets to
say I prefer candidate a to candidate be
a candidate C and then we take
everyone's votes and we output some kind
of winner and you'd really like this
winner to be you know like the one most
people prefer or something so the
problem that I've been specifically
looking at is that back in the 1970s
gibberty and Satterthwaite showed that
for any kind of reasonable voting
mechanism it's going to be susceptible
to manipulation so is this like when
someone doesn't vote for their preferred
candidate because they think it's gonna
be better for them if they vote for it
sort of more popular less preferred
candidate exactly so if you knew that
your favorite person was the underdog
and there was no way you might you might
change your vote so that way your second
favorite person would be the one that
selected so we've been specifically
looking at binary cup voting protocols
which are familiar to people I had
single elimination tournament so how
could someone manipulate a tournament
like this well so the tournament
organizer is allowed to pick the seating
of the players and that's the that's the
bracket that's in each round who plays
against you so for example I can show
you over here on the computer so here on
this slide we have actually the the
Women's World Cup and the seeding is
this picking of Germany versus Japan
Sweden vs. Australia and if I wanted
something else to happen maybe I could
have picked a different initial seating
here like maybe I have Sweden play
England and that would end up with a
different result out of the tournament
so let's go over a simple example so
one's familiar with the game
rock-paper-scissors and in computer
science we like things to be a power of
two so let's add in Hand Grenade so that
way we have four players so we've got
rock-paper-scissors Hand Grenade so now
we can look at two different tournament
brackets that have different winners so
if we have rock Vinay Paper Scissors
first Brock wins this matchup and then
scissors wins here and then Rock wins
the total bracket if on the other hand
we have a rock face paper and scissors
face Hand Grenade then paper knocks out
rock Hand Grenade still wins and Henman
E is the final one so the tournament
manipulation problem is to figure out if
there's a bracket so that your favorite
player wins like this given information
about the man chuckles I'm not sure if
this explains how the u.s. lost the
Women's World Cup but we'll leave that
is an open problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
