font that was oddly popular in the 90s
have you ever wondered why I felt like
that would even exist well as it turns
out it's possible to build a font family
made of images and icons rather than
letters now icon fonts provide a
fantastic option for the little images
and icons that often decorate websites
there's an icon font I like called the
social this front is free and
open-source so I could download it and
serve it from my site however the font
is publicly available from the font site
itself so I'll use that instead let's
see it in action
notice that I've added some shadow to
the font icons this file looks a bit
complex so bear with me here's what's
going on the icon font characters are
added using the CSS before selector I've
added some formatting to that as well
including CSS text shadow now that rule
is applied to every element whose class
name begins with social and you can see
that each of the list items has a class
with a name made up of social and a
brand name now at the top you'll see an
at import rule that points to an
external CSS file let's look at that now
the app font face rule at the top of
this gives the source of the actual font
files and the sim variations available
there and what do you see below that our
selectors based on the class names like
the ones we've used social Flickr social
laughter and so on for example set the
class social flicker on an element and
the character F will be displayed before
it which in the social font is the
Flickr logo clever huh icon fonts have a
number of advantages over plain old
images they're vector graphics that can
be infinitely scaled an entire set of
images can be downloaded in one font and
this makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability now if you look at
the resources required for the wheel of
icon fonts site you can see that the
total weight for the hundreds of images
from all the fonts on the
is less than 300 K icon fonts have a
number of advantages over plain old
images their vector graphics that can be
infinitely scaled and an entire set of
images can be downloaded in one font
this makes them a great potential
solution for responsive designs where
you require minimum downloads and
maximum scalability the example here
shows lots of different options for icon
fonts and of course the characters in
icon fonts behave just like letters in
other fonts so you can resize and color
them and use other CSS effects just like
you would with text there are lots of
tools for creating icon fonts and lots
of pre-built icon fonts check out the
links below the video there's also a

accessibility by using Aria attributes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
