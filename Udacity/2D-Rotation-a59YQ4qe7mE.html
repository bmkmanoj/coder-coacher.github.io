basically showing a simple example I
have two points X and this was the
original points here in X prime Y prime
where I want the transformation to
happen of course in this case these two
vectors kind of show how the
transformation would be and of course
there would be an angle associated with
this let's call that theta so in case
now I'm just looking at this simple 2d
example let me ask the question so in
this case of the simple 2d rotation by a
theta where I have transform points x +
y - x prime y prime question comes up is
how would i now figure out the values of
X prime Y prime given X and y and this
angle theta now if you may remember this
from your old trigonometry classes this
can be done and I encourage you to look
it up again if you haven't I looked at
such things recently and this would
basically said that X prime would
basically be computed by taking the
cosine of the angle theta here with X
the original x - y sine theta and
similarly Y prime would be given by X
sine theta plus y sin theta so this
basically now gives us an interesting
way now of course I can write this in a
matrix form which basically would mean I
would mode x and y into a column which
would now give me the elements of the M
matrix so M in this case would be cosine
theta minus sine theta sine theta cosine
theta enough of course knowing this
angle I can apply this as an image
transformation again I encourage you to
look this up or try to kind of do the
derivation just as a hint do this
derivation you would also need to
represent this angle and then basically
come up with equations to kind of
compare all of these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
