about context-free grammars and
languages and about parsing them but is
there anything beyond that is there
anything other than the context-free
grammars and the regular languages that
we've learned so far is there anything
more powerful that's an excellent
question it turns out that context free
grammars are not the end-all and be-all
of interpreting languages like java
script or HTML in fact just as we saw
that regular languages and regular
expressions weren't powerful enough to
do everything we needed they couldn't
handle balanced parentheses so we
couldn't use from for parsing it's going
to turn out that context-free languages
and context-free grammars will only take
us so far and we're going to use
additional techniques like
interpretation or keeping track of local
variables in order to find other things
out here's a great example of what the
free in context free actually means when
I think boys there are context expensive
grammar out there what's the opposite of
free turns out in this domain the
opposite of free is context-sensitive
and it's going to turn out that the
meaning of a program depends on its
context for example suppose I ask you
what's X plus 2 the meaning of that
program depends a lot on the local value
of x so we're going to need something
more than just parsing more than
context-free grammars to reason about
programs that include substrings like x
plus 2 if right above it I've written x
equals 4 then x equals 4x plus 2 yields
six but if right above it i've written x
equals zero then we'd get a different
answer that line above it is the context
our context-free grammar doesn't care
about the line above it you can write
down X plus 2 even if you've never
assigned to X before when we go to write
our interpreter for JavaScript and our
ability to render web pages by
interpreting HTML we're going to need to
keep track of the context the values of
variables what has gone before our
history all of that is going to matter
for figuring out the true
interpretations of programs so again
just as regular expressions weren't
powerful enough and we needed
context-free grammars for parsing we're
going to need something else
context sensitivity to make our final
web server and we're going to get to
that and around unit five in this class
so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
