partitioning is np-complete so your
first intuition about graphs is that you
need to look for good heuristics and try
to exploit special structure wherever
possible here's a first simple heuristic
it's called graph bisection and it's
based on the principle of divide and
conquer the idea is simple suppose you
want P partitions start by first using
any algorithm to divide the graph into
two partitions then divide each half
into two you would repeat this process
until you obtain the desired number of
partitions that's nice but not very
satisfying after all how do you get
two-way partitions we'll get there but
first let's build some more intuition
now some graphs are special for instance
this graph is planar a planar graph is
one that can be drawn in the plane with
no edge crossings so for instance here's
another planar graph by the way this
thing is supposed to be a tapir for
planar graphs there's a really neat
theorem this theorem is in fact due in
part to georgia tech's very own dick
Lipton
anyway the theorem goes like this given
a graph with n vertices the theorem says
that there's a way to partition the
vertices into three disjoint sets a B
and s such that the following super cool
properties hold the first one is that s
is a separator for V that is there are
no edges that directly connect a and B
but differently the subset of vertices s
acts as a kind of wall between a and B
in other words if you take the separator
out of a connected graph you get two or
more connected sub graphs that's the
first property here's the second each of
the subsets a and B have no more than
two-thirds n vertices each that's really
neat too because if one of the
partitions has at most 2/3 and vertices
than the other has at least one-third
that in turn means that the larger of
the two partitions is no more than twice
the size of the other if the two
partitions are within a factor of two of
each other then that's pretty balanced
well sort of maybe if you crane your
neck a lot and look at a funny angle
well a factor of two is good enough for
government work dagnabbit the third
property is the neatest
it says that the size of the vertex
separator is about square root of n for
the grid or lattice graph this result
should make intuitive sense a natural
separator for this grid graph would be
say some row or some column of vertices
such a row or column would of course be
root N in size now the existence of a
planar separator does not guarantee you
can minimize the edge cut efficiently
but keeping this lattice graph in mind
an algorithm that can find the separator
should heuristic aliy find a decent
partition in fact Lipton and Tarjan in
their original paper described a
polynomial time algorithm to find such a
separator anyway there's a ton of cool
work related to more general separator
theorems head to the instructors notes
