over part of the user's home screen with
widgets meaning that the trade their
precious homes green space for more
information from sunshine a useful trade
off for me and maybe for many others
there's another element on the home
screen we haven't looked at the
background of the homes being called the
wallpaper could we use the wallpaper as
a passive way to bring weather
information to the user yes we can now
the type of information we can provide
for a wallpaper somewhat different from
widget colored icons and text don't
exactly scream most beautiful background
ever to me but what we can do is make
the beautiful backgrounds into the
weather sunny picture for a sunny day a
snowy picture for wintertime fun and
some ominous rain clouds for when an
umbrella is a good idea sounds neat huh
but how would you actually do it what
about pictures that are too bright
making the text or icons hard to read
how can we build something like this
without becoming an expert on
dynamically changing wallpapers
sometimes you do have to become an
expert but just as many times some good
Google foo might reveal the perfect
library or the perfect app that makes
your job much much easier it just so
happens this is one of those cases
there's already a live wallpaper app out
there called mu Z that provides an
extensible system sunshine can plug into
to build our dynamic weather wallpapers
so how does that even work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
