episode of our coffee and croissants
series at Udacity I'm Ankur and I'm your
host at Udacity we focus on accessible
higher education to prepare students for
jobs of tomorrow and as part of that we
have one of our many programs the
digital marketing nano degree where we
prepare students for roles in digital
marketing we focus on all the core
aspects of digital marketing in our
degree but in this coffee and croissant
series I get a chance to talk to
marketers people who are actually in
these digital marketing roles today and
I get to chat about their backgrounds
how they experience their roles about
the industry and a little bit about
their thinking on the future of digital
marketing so today I'm actually German
by my colleagues at Udacity from our own
marketing department now I'm gonna
introduce you to the next but before I
do that and before I talk to them about
their backgrounds I thought I'd give you
a little bit of information as well
about my own so I studied psychology and
during my master's I focused on consumer
research and marketing in cognitive
psychology and then after that I joined
Unilever I was there for a few years I
focused on consumer research and then I
went on to Yahoo where I headed up the
global market research department for
about eight years actually after that I
left a company started a company that
focused on developing software to
optimize advertising revenue for
publishers and then I saw that company
to open X and I joined open X for a
while
open X is an advertising technology
company I learned all about advertising
technology we integrated the software
and while I was doing all that actually
for the past eight years I have been on
the faculty of the UCLA Anderson
Business School as well where I've been
teaching digital marketing but then a
good year ago I joined Udacity and there
I've had the privilege of developing the
digital marketing nanodegree leading it
as well but all of that while support
by a terrific group of colleagues here
at Udacity who are smart energetic and
have helped us along the way
and of course the marketing department
is super important in that so we thought
what would be more fitting than for our
first kind of coffee and croissants
episode to bring together our colleagues
from our marketing department so today I
am joined by some mother Harry I'm
joined by Divya Hillier and by Kelly
Schwartz who are all in our marketing
department and I'll get to talk to them
about their backgrounds and what they
think about marketing these days so
welcome to our chat sure
so some let me start with you so I would
love to hear a little bit more about
control your background your current
role and kind of how you got into
digital marketing sure yeah so I first
got started with the real estate was
kind of a family business and so through
high school and college I was working in
real estate and that's kind of where I
got my first experience with digital
marketing real estate agents are big in
marketing both for the properties that
they're selling and for themselves as
independent contractors almost so I got
my experience you know writing ad copy
finding out channels to to do our own
promotion and promotion for our
properties and then when I was in
college I studied marketing business
administration from there I got an
opportunity to do an internship with a
consumer sports equipment company got to
experience branding and direct response
advertising for an e-commerce site got
to work with a couple other consumer
companies to do online marketing
eventually I got to work at Google as
part of the AdWords product management
team helping to improve the AdWords
advertising platform for the digital
marketers and got to work with a number
of different startups also lead
marketing and product for the one
startup in particular called at stage
which is a online advertising platform
and a cross-channel platform to help you
manage your campaigns on Google being
Twitter Linkedin
in facebook and yeah from from there
just a couple other startups and now
here I am at Udacity here I manage our
online advertising and do a lot of
marketing on our website too so things
like landing pages and site tracking
analytics get to look at just different
ways for us to improve our performance
on our website and I know that's a lot
it's great so not Kelly I would like to
ask who is that if you're a little bit
about your background and your role here
at Udacity sure so I've been at Udacity
since about December and I'm the social
media and content marketing manager here
so social media obviously like we teach
a lot of social media in the nanodegree
program but my background in that first
was I studied Media Studies in college
so that was like a little bit of
journalism and video production as well
as just like basic writing tenants from
there from there I went into public
relations which was not my forte I
learned so I ended up working in media
so like online media for women's
basically online magazine and that
actually so every day it was writing
reporting etc creating videos but it
also included a lot of social media
because I was a few years ago before the
days of specific social media
departments within media publications
which now every media publication will
have like people who are devoted just to
social media but back then we wrote our
own articles and did our own social
media so that's kind of my backgrounds
and then for the online mark or the
content marketing part I worked at
Udacity doing our Udacity talks and our
new podcast and we are doing a lunch
today so I need to sneak away for a
second and get some social media for
that but I'll be back we know that so
well Divya
can you tell us a little bit more about
your background yes so I did my
undergrad in Business Economics and
then my master's in communication
management which is kind of a nebulous
way to say all kinds of communication
you know internal communication external
communication marketing branding etc and
then I started my career in online games
so I I was a producer for a first-person
shooter for a few years and then I was a
producer for a real time strategy game
that was also like a resource management
game was very innovative at the time
similar to League of Legends anybody
knows what that is and then I moved to
online poker and then I worked at online
poker I worked at eBay doing a SEO for
emerging market and then I joined
Udacity so I run SEO at Udacity here and
I'm sure we'll cover a lot about you
know the subject matter but my
day-to-day is making sure that you guys
can find us very cool so well definitely
a variety of backgrounds and I think
that's one of the beauties of digital
marketing that people come to this role
from very different backgrounds
altogether now of course so here we
represent so search engine optimization
we have the online advertising side
we've got a social side there are some
other roles as well that we have in our
marketing department so what else can
what else is there Sam would you say and
how does your role fit in in the broader
marketing department sure yeah some
other I think you rules are content and
copywriting PR and communications
product marketing to tell they don't
know how to position the products that
we're offering especially in the broader
landscape email marketing email
marketing absolutely especially for
acquisition and for retention also we
have data analysis would be one of those
big center of data and as well as all of
the you know business development side
yeah all of our amazing hiring partners
and yes yeah yeah yeah cuz what always
strikes me when working with a
department is that there's definitely so
there's the the content side of things
and
creative side of things and we have a
lot of talent there and then we have the
quantitative side of things as well and
further optimization of campaigns etc
and those to convert together all the
time and it's really like one can do
without the others right it even seems
that in both of your backgrounds you've
got a little bit of both mixed in so
what do you say that for your roles like
in search engine optimization for
instance are there certain certificates
that people require certain when you
look to hire someone in this area is
there something specifically that you
look for so for SEO there's no
certificate that I could put my finger
on to say wow like that is the one thank
goodness you have that you know
everything now because it's a lot of
on-the-job experience a lot of times and
I think that when I am looking for
someone in this space and trying to
validate whether or not they actually
have the chops to sort of handle this
job I'm really looking to see what type
of projects that they've worked on and
to see if they can understand all the
mechanics go into the project and then
what the impact is of doing the project
because it's really the type of thing
where at least for us it's such a
long-term play that if you're not able
to understand what's going to happen at
the end of your project to a certain
degree we how do you know if you're
wasting your time yeah
so it's basically comes down to really
planning out well what you want to
achieve it yet right and measuring and
measuring for that yeah I see and would
you say in your role Sam are there
particular certificates that is any
they're helpful they're good to have
yeah I think a couple examples come to
mind one certainly the the Google
AdWords certification and Google
Analytics certification being ads has a
similar certifications also they're
helpful for me to know that someone has
at least proven almost like the book
knowledge of how these different
platforms work it's not at all critical
I think the more interesting thing is if
someone's actually run campaigns that's
definitely the most valuable piece of
information and for me to measure kind
of the quality of someone's experience
one quick way is to ask their butt
but more interesting that then that is
what their goals were for the campaigns
what channels they ran those campaigns
on how complicated the campaigns were
because you could you could have a very
small budget but have a very clever and
sophisticated structure to those
campaigns and having that hands-on
first-hand experience is absolutely
critical I see now you both mentioned
that that hands-on experience and that
learning on the job is something that
that really is part of how you got to
where you are now and how do you so how
did you establish that yourself like
what gave you the chance to practice
right undo to get that experience so how
was that for you divya because he kind
of tumbled into a CEO in i hold into my
entire career I feel like of it but to
start what happened was you know when I
was working in online games I was one of
my responsibilities as a producer you
tend to be responsible for all kind of
angles of the product and you can
consider yourself a product owner or
something but it's pretty specific to
that industry and one of the things I
was responsible for was the website web
performance conversion etc and it was a
little bit before those were just common
things that you throw around and worry
about and web optimization wasn't really
like a huge thing and I certainly didn't
know anything about it and so luckily
just because I'm a really good rule
follower I was I was able to kind of
stave off any huge destruction from
doing something really stupid but you
know when I had the opportunity to work
at eBay it was originally a Content role
and that was on the SEO team and it was
at a time when you know people were
really trying to prove the theory that
quality content is actually one of the
most important levers that you can have
to drive traffic and it was really a
mental shift because people were really
saying like oh you know it's it's all
about technical which it's about both it
turns out but at the time they hired me
to figure out a way to prove our oh I
for creating good content and I was you
know I produced a ton of content when I
was
and games and so it seemed like an okay
fit and then very quickly I found myself
loving the space and kind of going more
and more in depth on all pillars of SEO
instead of just so you really saw kind
of opportunities for yourself to
practice things that yeah attractive to
you yeah and I think finding a team that
is interested in experimentation that's
kind of important for that because when
you have someone who's new and looking
at things through fresh eyes like it's
easy to get jaded and get used to the
basics of your job and when you present
something new to someone who is you know
just trying to figure it all out and
they're creating their own big picture
then they're gonna come up with some
cool experiments like I was able to do
my job and be really successful because
I'd never really done search before and
so I could look at content from a
totally fresh pair of eyes and say how
could you not find value in this yeah
and for you some like what was an
opportunity for you to kind of get that
practice that surely hands-on experience
that you needed you know like one big
impact with social media and just like
even creating Facebook groups in the
early days and just figuring out ways to
almost build my own personal brand on on
Facebook and then take advantage of
other opportunities to leverage the
tools and platforms had so for example
on Facebook I'd create groups for
different school functions for for my
church for small businesses I would even
like the church is a great example
because I I launched a Facebook Ads
campaign with a dollar a day because I
had an idea I had a website to send
people to and a goal that I had in mind
and it was just a chance to kind of
experiment yeah and with a dollar a day
I was getting you know thousands of
impressions and learning all these
different metrics and it was just very
interesting to me and then I was in an
internship that you know like Divya
mentioned a company that was small
enough to make an impact but also had a
desire for experimentation and I had the
freedom to kind of gravitate towards
those channels and activities that were
interesting to me and so when I saw an
opportunity to take on advertising I had
some experience from just like different
community and personal projects and
leverage that for activities for a
bigger business and then my first job
out of college well
running ad campaigns owning ad campaigns
with budgets of you know up to $300,000
a month really sophisticated campaigns
but it was that that personal and
internship experience that I had that
helped me speak intelligently about how
those campaigns are structured gave me
knowledge about the vertical on the
industry
and just kind of wet from it from there
so I think yeah just taking advantage of
any personal projects and like a
personal interest and finding ways to do
it and I think small businesses are a
great way to do it yeah everyone's dying
to have you know a Facebook page a Yelp
account that's you know driving in foot
traffic or just ways to promote your
content yeah yeah and that's one of the
things this is a common question we get
from our students like well I want to
build up this experience so I have it
when I go and I find a job or I ask for
a job and it's it's something we try to
do in the program we give them an
opportunity to actually run an actual
campaign and try it all out so at least
they have that experience but yes we
would also advise our students to try
and seek those opportunities as you both
date a little bit in a role that you're
in or you could also do it just trying
the tools that are out there for you
find a business that has a need for a
little bit of help it's not about big
budgets but it's about willingness to
try it almost and to experiment with the
tools that are there right you can you
know another thing that I did to get
more familiar faster because I just
wanted to ramp up really quick is that
you can look at companies and businesses
that are large and successful and kind
of backtrack and reverse engineer their
campaigns or reverse engineer their
sites and so I used to do some when I
first started in SEO I you know when
you're learning and you're so excited
and you just want to know everything I
used to sound myself a target for every
two weeks I would do an audit on a
different site that I personally used
yeah and kind of try to look through
like okay you know here's this site I
came how did I get to them why did I get
to them what are they ranking for how
are they why would they be ranking this
page for that you know and really
started to try to break it down for
myself because granted I don't work at
that large company at that moment but
you know it's it's easy to
look through the thought process of
someone who is running Iraq why does
this ad showing for me when I'm looking
for this and you can kind of look and
see is this the copy if I like keep
doing this in different ways like a
different copy you know you can you can
find a way to get inside the mind of
people or teams that are at these bigger
companies because they have bigger more
resources than a smaller team and so
while you're practicing so that you know
in theory if someone came to you
tomorrow and said run these ads for
Amazon you know you would be familiar
with the platform you would know how to
execute it but what ads are they running
why are they running it you know that
was super helpful for me I see so really
kind of seeking an opportunity to do
research on someone else's work as well
I think that's great advice as well I
think our students should try that and
now you actually Sam mentioned personal
branding yeah I was
I think that's indeed that is an
important piece as well right and for
some of our students when you go and you
try to find a job in digital marketing
seems like personal brand does matter is
that something so what do you say Kelly
and I see your launch but so would you
say it's a personal brand when you think
about that and you know definitely from
a social perspective how do you build it
how do you protect it what can a student
do in that space um so I definitely know
people I think it's just those friends
and colleagues who have been in the
industry for a bit longer marketing
social media editorial whatever it is
that it don't really build up their
personal brand and are able to still
play that off but I think it's really
useful to build a personal brand of some
kind it doesn't mean you have to have
you know over a thousand followers on
Twitter or anything but just kind of
staying involved in conversations
whether that's in Facebook groups or
LinkedIn groups there are so many that
you can just like be involved with and
also I mean it does help to just I don't
know if any job would necessarily say
like I want to see you messaging or
constantly tweeting from your personal
account but showing the demonstration
that you know how to use these tools and
that I don't know that just that I think
I guess
personal side of branding is to me more
building eager awareness and being able
to talk the talk and knowing not
necessarily the jargon but just like
what is part of the job you're
interviewing for yeah yeah and I would I
would agree with that I think that
personal brand is for some people they
build up a personal brand where they
have indeed a large following and they
do a lot in terms of creating content
because this requires a lot of
management but on the other hand just
having a presence listening and trying
to have a little bit of conversation in
these platforms that will later on use a
lot is essential and I know that Divya
you've done some work around personal
brand as well right for yourself yeah
and you know one of the things is like
it depends on the space that you're
going for and I think one of the most
important components of personal
branding is what is your story and how
do you communicate that story because
it's not necessarily like Ellie said
some people might have thousands of
followers some people might have all
private accounts that's really not it's
it's not something that you know if
you're in social media you probably
should be thinking about what is my
social media story that I'm telling in
general I think that being able to say
like hey I can paint you a clear picture
of who I am whether it's via my LinkedIn
profile whether it's on my resume
whether I'm actually coming in for an
interview you should know who I am what
I'm about what I'm interested in and my
you know my journey and the the
rationale for it and and why it's made
me so useful to you know this company or
just why my advice is important you know
you should know that about me pretty
quickly I think
and that is kind of the power of a
personal brand is when you walk into a
room you know we see everything about
your put together we know your story if
there's something strengths like a lot
of times people have career changes are
used to working online games and the
thing is is that you know what were the
transferrable skills why was it you know
why is it
super important actually that I worked
in that space
and if I need to explain you know say a
gap in my resume or a you know confusing
job or a short job sometimes can be a
big issue for people how do we tell that
story so I it doesn't seem confusing or
like a negative but actually it can be
explained in a positive way yeah yeah so
and then well did you tell marketing as
we all know was kind of a super fast
moving field right so it's so once you
have a job your job changes it changes
it will be changed tomorrow it will be
different again a month later so what do
you do to keep up with things so Sam if
you look at kind of your day to day or
in general can ya write a particular
blogs you read newsletters like what do
you do to keep up with how the field is
all yeah I mean especially with online
advertising I think more than any other
channel there's constantly new ad
networks there's new ad formats there's
changes to the auction models and to the
rules and every every network is
optimizing their platforms to monetize
and they're all kind of competing there
and so staying a prize of that and also
trends is pretty difficult really
fast-moving so I think that the things
that really helped me early on were
setting up RSS feeds that would pull in
from these different blogs blogs that
come to mine our search engine land
marketing land Ad Age emarketer for data
and even different agencies and
platforms like PPC hero from Hennepin
marketing those are really helpful and
pulling those into RSS feed or RSS
readers like Google used to have one now
it's Digg reader as what I use Flipboard
that's what I wear I would go if I'm
really in the mood for consuming that
content but really what it's become now
is using my community of other like
thought leaders and and peers in the
space and seeing what they're sharing so
it's really just LinkedIn it's Facebook
it's following those blogs and also
following those peers to see what's top
of mind because the thing is like in
terms of building the personal brand
digital marketers are great at it but
what that means is you're getting this
flood of content that isn't always
quality and so sifting through that can
be really difficult and so leveraging
your network to filter through that and
to surface things that are truly
value-adds
is really helpful and so for me now it's
becoming a lot of LinkedIn those are yes
yeah I can see that and would you say
for you Kelly is there are the
particular sources that you use to stay
on top yeah I think I would say a lot of
the same ones that Sam just mentioned
but then a lot of the for me social
media but like the marketing tools such
as like HootSuite or like buffered they
all have great blogs that they give in
say or sprout social there's some other
ones but they just all have great blogs
with insights I'm told yeah what's
changing why Facebook changed a certain
algorithm so you can get insight into
like maybe why your social traffic
referrals have dipped that week yeah
that's really helpful and then just
again like following specific peers like
I follow a lot of also those websites as
well as just specific marketers on
Twitter and just see what they're
sharing - yeah yeah it is that the state
for you to be in it really is I mean
it's just cherry-picking the people that
you can trust if they Bob like there's
such a fine anna of time in the world
holt and i don't have time to read every
single thing that comes out and i can't
trust that every story isn't just
clickbait or something like that and so
if you can find publications or industry
influencers or friends that you can
trust that if they put something out
there you save that link and you'll read
it later that's really been super
helpful for me yeah and I would say I
personally do the same a guy also yeah
follow a few peers a few blogs where I
feel ok these are really good blogs
these ones I want to follow and then
again yes as you said like what bubbles
up to LinkedIn helps me a lot as well
because that comes out of my network and
the network of people that I select and
trust in that space so I do a lot of
that as well I also keep up with so the
tools the main tools that I use and I
look at their blogs and just to make
sure that we know what's new in a space
that is important to me as well but yeah
it's a constant learning it's actually a
lot of fun
I think I'm part of digital marketing I
really like now when we think about the
future of digital marketing I think
things that are mentioned and actually
here around Udacity we even have
nano degree around it but artificial
intelligence is something that many
people see as a bit of a threat to
different jobs right and it influences
us as well but would you say like if you
think about that Sam is there particular
things that come to mind where you feel
like hey this is the influence I see
this is how I think it might affect us
in the future I mean the impact of AI is
prevalent everywhere in marketing and I
think just today I got an email from
AdWords saying we're gonna start
creating additional ads leveraging your
existing ads inside content and just
start replacing elements and variables
and yeah so if you're not actively
testing new ads we're basically gonna
force your hand need 14 days or so to
review it and then we're gonna run it
things like that it doesn't have to be
like a tool that's like branded as AI
but it's just so much of the work is
becoming automated and I think it really
is helpful I don't think it replaces the
need for qualified marketers but it does
take a lot of the tedious grunt work out
of it and it helps you focus on the
things that are truly value-adds like I
know my business I know my competition
and in light of that I can take this
support that a is providing and and just
make the most of it
so it's it's helping us be more
productive and it's so much better for
individuals for like the consumers that
are seeing our ads now they're not stuck
with you know what worked three months
ago but they're always getting something
that's just better content for them and
a better experience for them so it's
definitely a win-win yeah and would you
say the same thing divya from your
perspective is yeah i mean you know you
mentioned threats to a job i'm always of
the mindset that things like AI just
continue to increase a level playing
field and so you know all it does is
make an individual marketer more
powerful one by one right you don't need
a team of ten to parse through you know
millions and millions or billions of
data points now some amazing program is
going to do it for you and you can make
the more strategic decisions and you
create the bigger picture and you can
really like take a step back from all of
that grunt work that you normally would
have to do it's time-saving and it lets
you solve bigger problems and yeah yeah
I would think so I think it will over
time it'll shift the focus a little bit
I think of marketers and that we will be
probably more focused on the customer
journey more focused on content and
storytelling because that part isn't
immediately gonna be taken on by AI so
yeah I do think that it does indeed it
makes for better marketing overall so
we're overall I'm excited about that
development I don't think it's scary but
I think it's essential that we
understand it and then we learn how it
really influences the marketing field
now I want to shift a little bit to so
some of our students have asked us like
hey how does this work like when you get
into the digital marketing field I would
love to get Mentors
how does that work how does that help
someone throughout their careers so when
you think about that for yourself Kelly
did you have a mentor throughout your
career that you've relied on yeah so
Debbie and I were talking about that
before this and I don't know if I would
say I had a mentor specifically that I
would meet with you know once a month
for coffee play I have a lot of just
good friends and previous maybe managers
or just leaders within companies I've
worked for that I even to this day can
feel comfortable asking for their advice
on or just their experience with certain
aspects of my job like there is one
person that I worked with who whenever
there's something new in the world of
social media like how an algorithm
changes or whatever I asked her how she
sort of adapting her and her team or
adapting to that and that's helpful I
mean it's not necessarily like a formal
mentor relationship that a lot of people
will talk about but it's just kind of
carving out people that you trust and
whose opinions you can kind of reach for
yeah is that similar for you to do yes
and I will add that not only have I
never had a formal mentor but I do have
a number of people that I feel really
lucky that I can kind of con for advice
and whatever area that it
that I need but also I think you have to
a lot of times brute-force your mentors
a little bit which sounds super crazy
but you people aren't really gonna come
to you and say hey uncle you have
promised I'm gonna mentor you if that
happens to you that's amazing
write a blog about it I will read it but
you know for the most part it's really
uncas gonna go and say hey I like what
that person is doing and I want to know
more about it and if I have to you know
take them out for coffee or you know
just set a meeting or chase them are on
the office or whatever it might be or
maybe it's someone you don't know and
then you just have to like messes them
on LinkedIn or find a mutual contact but
you have to be I don't say aggressive
but you have to you have to go for
something because typically people who
are someone you would want to mentor you
are busy that's doing awesome that you
are also be doing and so you know you
kind of have to force your way into
their time politely you know if that's
really like support that you want from
them yeah yeah have you experienced that
as well Sam yeah absolutely I mean I'd
agree like brute force is one way to put
it I think the words that come to mind
are like really being intentional about
pursuing that um whenever you find
someone who is knowledgeable about
anything or has had a success that you
aspire to like if you would like to
emulate this person for me it was
definitely my managers but also just
peers like students that were great
ahead of me or people that had landed
the job that I want to land or even just
lay one example is I have some friends
that are great at networking and I want
to learn that so just picking their
brain for like the more like formal like
consistent person that you go to I think
it's just kind of proving that you're
teachable that you're curious you're
hungry and that they're not wasting
their time by speaking with you but that
the advice that they share is something
that you're actually going to take to
heart and make actionable changes just
actually take steps to follow that and I
think it's inspiring for them and it's
yeah it's rewarding for both both
parties I
that's yeah that's great advice that's
going to put it that way and I think I'd
for me as well I've also had I got
several people that would call mentors
throughout my career even though it was
never a very formal relationship where
you really expressed like you're my
mentor you're going to do this for me
yeah but it's really trying to extract
these pieces of advice from someone and
I think if you indeed if you show
someone that you act on those then
they'll be willing to give you the next
piece of advice because it feels very
flattering because I see that now when
you're yeah
now that we're in roles where we're
actually also mentoring or advising some
people there it's flattering when you
see people asking your advice and then
act on that advice and do something with
that
I have also and I think that's important
as well is throughout my career try to
find people who are in somewhat similar
situations as my selves also at a
personal level if you want to juggle a
family in a career how do other people
do that let me take a look at how that
works for them and it all takes some of
their advice and I'll try to put that
into my life as well so I think those
parts are important too yeah I would say
just it it kind of seems like this big
formal like daunting thing to find a
mentor and then have that person like
responsible for your success yeah I
think if you were to if I were to tell
my mentor if I were to name my mentors
almost every one of them would probably
be surprised that I were to list them
because it's not a fun thing yeah it's
very informal but they're they have an
impact on my life and I very like
clearly and intentionally pursue them
for for advice in different areas so
it's not necessarily like a
mentor-protege relationship it's you
going after you know someone else who
has done something that you aspire to
absolutely and I think what I hear from
all of you as well it's typically not
one person yeah exactly
yes yeah and also and be as you said
Divya proactive about it
a little bit aggressive maybe even
because but yeah yeah it's a it's okay
to do that as long as you're polite
about it respect someone's time I do
want to add in as we were talking about
this I was imagining out of context some
of the words I said I want to add in
that you know when you're targeting
somebody who you don't know
for advice I think it's super important
to look at this person and say what
would be the the lowest friction way for
me to get some feedback from this person
because I will say that I've I've
encountered some scenarios where someone
will use a mutual some shared piece of
background and perhaps we went to the
same school or you know they're
interested in working at the company I'm
working at and I'm totally comfortable
with advising people you know for
whatever they want but there's sort of a
difference between saying hi I need 30
minutes of your time for a coffee in you
know this town versus hey I have a quick
question could you just advise me on
like hmm you know how did you do X or
what do you think the best what I do y
is you know it's it's a lot easier for
someone to quickly answer that question
and continue that conversation and to
say I need you to stop what you're doing
and reposition yourself at a different
location you know yeah so well I think
when we think about our students and
people who aspire to be in your roles in
the future so when I think about Cali
for instance you're in a social media
marketing role which I think many of our
students aspire to it's a very
interesting field it's it's a cool field
to be in
would there be pieces of advice you
would have for them now as they build up
their kind of career trajectory as to
what they should focus on what they
should think about um I'm just talking
about this with some friends the other
day actually is that not to dismiss
having to work yourself up from the
bottom like you have your eyes on a
prize that's like social media manager
but be open to being a coordinator or an
intern or taking on freelance projects
freelance projects I mean I used to do
that a lot just from a writing
perspective and I have friends that will
take on social media projects for small
businesses and that is just a great way
to like expand your portfolio and show
that you you know took this small
business in your local town from X hour
just just showing that you can build
campaigns for small businesses and
showing it that growth so just being
open to smaller projects and building
your career out from there yeah
so kind of coming back to the discussion
we had earlier about trying to seek
opportunities a little bit of experience
yeah
any other pieces of advice you would
have for people who want to be in your
roles yeah I think it's definitely for
from an advertising side or even
anything digital marketing mmm get your
hands on some real world experience
whatever means necessary if it's putting
up your own money you know fifty dollars
to run a campaign or find you know
another business to subsidize it just do
it figure out some way to to actually
think through a business's goals and
come up with a strategy for achieving
those and try to use the actual tools
that everyone else is using there's
every tool is free like there's just
every tool has a free plan you don't
need enterprise level software you can
just use buffer and HootSuite and
Facebook Ads there's just so many great
ways to try it out with no risk and no
commitment yeah and you can see what you
like there's so many different parts of
digital marketing that how that you can
experience and you might find something
that just really clicks with you based
on how creative you are
how analytical you are or even just what
you like to do with your personal time
if you love Facebook or Instagram like
that could be your niche yeah yeah and I
think also um as you're trying to grab
on to all these front bits of experience
I think one of the things when you start
out and you're just trying to create
opportunities for yourself as a lot of
times they can seem really disjointed so
taking it back to the personal branding
a little bit map out the story that
you're trying to tell and try to fill
those either gaps or areas of knowledge
that you're trying to build very
strategically so you can say hey I want
to be a social media marketer I
understand that there's something to do
you know there's content here there's
also timing there's the analytics piece
and this is how I've taught myself or
this is how I've given myself experience
if you build that structure it will help
you have clarity on what you're doing
but it will also help someone who is
trying to give you a foot in the door
somewhere like understand that there is
someone here who is super hungry to do
this job and is really approaching it
intelligently
I see well yeah that's yes just add to
that yeah if if you're in a position
like let's say you're in an existing
career and you have a job that's pretty
like well defined and you don't have the
opportunity to work in digital marketing
and that role like put in extra time and
and you know do 110 percent of your
homework but then take some extra time
and in your free time like just take
advantage of opportunities to to
demonstrate your interest to show that
you're hungry for the other roles and
just find a way to do it if like for me
personally like my background is real
estate and it would be hard maybe to
pivot from real estate into digital
marketing but by taking my real estate
and then filling in ad copy and new
channels that I can advertise to I'm
able to make the connection from one
very different industry to where I want
to be without having to change careers
yet yeah I think also if we don't sure
can stay on that's for us like I think
help watching what other brands are
doing it won't necessarily help your
portfolio but just like actually
studying whatever the focus is that
you're interested in and kind of seen
what other companies are doing or you
know content that does really performs
really well on social media say that
will give you some a better look at how
you should be shaping projects that you
might be able to get within your own
company or in outside companies yeah
actually what are the interview
questions that they ask people who are
obviously not yeah super in-depth within
the field that they're going for is like
can you give me an example of some
campaigns and X that you've found to be
effective and why yeah so not
necessarily campaign they ran themselves
but something did they can discover
break it down based on the experience
they've had themselves and say from what
I've seen you know this is how they did
this and I thought it was terrific
because that content played really well
it would basically I'm viral and you
know was something that it's a
consistent you know monthly update that
they do that I just think is super
impactful like I love that I love when
somebody is so observant and they're
just looking at everything and trying to
really break it all down and I
for their own job yeah yeah and if those
are shown their passion and interest
when you do that now actually at this
point I want to take the time to change
tracks a little bit and go to some
questions that we've received from our
students so as you know we have a large
number of students in the digital
marketing nanodegree program they knew
we have our coffee and croissant chat
today so they've sent in some questions
and so a first question and I'll
actually read it off is from Teresa G
who's one of our students and she asks
so how does someone with nonlinear work
history sell themselves and we've talked
a little bit about it's about this
particular topic but she says look I've
been a paralegal I've been an executive
assistant I've been a teacher and an
online content provider so how I may
want to go into digital marketing how do
i best package this up and kind of sell
myself in that space so Kelly would you
have any advice for a student who is in
a situation like that I guess in my own
experience I hasn't been necessarily
nonlinear for me but the the industries
have been very different so is finding
that thread in like Divya has said is
looking at your personal branding from
the perspective of what's my story to
tell how can you say you're just looking
at a job description for something for a
position in digital marketing that
you're interested in kind of seeing what
the requirements are and backing up how
you have previous experience in that
yeah just kind of seen though that job
description as like the questions you
have to answer and building that out
from your previous experience that's
yeah and and Divya you've had experience
with exactly that right yes it seems
like your path is also yes yeah yeah I
think really it's like Kelly said start
with what is the job you're trying to
get and that is the first question so if
it's in digital marketing is it a
marketing coordinator is it in one of
you know a more specialized field what
are they asking for and then look back
on your experience because the jobs for
example the Teresa listed are they have
a lot of transferable skills that come
with them starting with things like
organization and being adaptive
being able to figure out you know what's
coming up next and sort of plan and be
structured and so I think figuring out
what those skills are that come from the
jobs you've done and how they map to the
new job you want to do it helps build
that story and it also its 2017 like
people have non-linear careers like it's
champion we work at one company for
twenty years and they give us an award
and we were tired it's expected that you
would have a sort of different
background but it's like can you make
that a cohesive story and and can you
make that something you build every time
you get a new job or is it every time
you're starting over from scratch and
you know you just look at it as if
you've never done anything in your life
yeah yeah I think one thing I'd add is
it's one thing to talk about your path
in person but one of the biggest
challenges is listing out in your resume
what your story is
or even LinkedIn profile one thing that
I had to do is I mentioned I started out
in real estate originally that was kind
of part of my resume but over time I
just didn't list that anymore I would
focus on things that that fit into my
story there's a lot of side jobs a lot
of startups that I'd work nights and
weekends that I just don't even talk
about because it doesn't fit into this
overall story I'm telling i'd say it's
being selective about what you choose to
list if your last one role is in the
industry but the three prior aren't
maybe you don't even talk about those
three prior roles if you choose to talk
about them and then highlight
accomplishments that are relevant if
you've had a hundred projects that you
were part of but ten of them or five of
them are relevant to digital marketing
focus on those or at least
spin every accomplishment to
specifically call out where the
relevance is with the role you're going
after but don't feel pressure to list
everything I I feel like her
Teresa's last role seemed very relevant
that means there's no market yeah yes so
maybe just focus on that one or that in
the one before because like Dibya
mention its 2017 like a lot of these
platforms and channels haven't been
around for very long two years of
experience with
like the cutting edge is very relevant
yeah and yeah there's not much of a
disadvantage to not have eight years of
experience with social media you know
exactly that
yes no that's true no I would I would
agree with all of that and I would also
suggest suggested Teresa too and
whatever role you go for to study the
role really well and also get a good
sense of okay this is the role this is
what other people in those roles do this
is what typically happens on day to day
basis and then do what all of you said
is highlight whatever has come before in
your career that matches some of the
things that will be required in that new
role there will be strengths in every
single one of the things you've done
and as Livia also said like yeah you've
got the organizational skill you've got
the control in this case also the
content related skill which is really
important and then teaching to me
because she has been a teacher as well
that's all about persuasion
communication and that translates really
well to marketing and advertising so
there's many things that you could
really kind of grasp onto and say okay
these things translate into job them try
to go for right and why is that further
as we're talking about it is the job
that we're looking at the job
description think about the person
posting the job or the hiring manager
who is sorting through these resumes
yeah because like you said this story I
mean we see thousands of resumes you
know and one of the things that's really
hard is when you have somebody come in
who maybe doesn't have a really logical
background for the role that they're
going for and you have literally ten
seconds to look at this and be like am I
going to keep going or is this just you
know this is too much effort for me to
parse and create that story myself to
understand how oh this could be
something that is applicable I don't
really know you know turn it into a
story for that person because assume
that any job you're going for you have a
lot of competition and people the person
that's trying to slam through these
resumes you know they want spell it out
for them I love that do them a favor and
let them be like this might be the one
let me see you actually try to stand out
yeah that's really that is important
well we have another question that came
in from mill one of our students
and he actually describes there's many
online platforms out there and many have
introduced a very easy-to-use kind of
accessible marketing tool that everyone
can get their hands on as you said right
these tools are out there they're easy
to use and small companies can easily do
this themselves so where does that leave
a marketer if the small company can
easily do it themselves do we still need
marketers so what's the whole kind of
like how do we position ourselves
marketing yeah I mean absolutely I think
every company for free can create email
campaigns can have marketing automation
can do can queue up their social media
posts can spruce up their social
profiles do web analytics it's all free
and freely available but it's
time-consuming and it takes experience
and it takes an understanding of what
the nuances are for each of these
channels so yeah you can do it they're
not doing it you definitely need a team
of people that are focused on it because
otherwise you're drowning in data you're
drowning in capabilities and you feel
like this burden too to take advantage
of it but you really can't and so just
just as before these teams are
critically needed it's just the four or
five people or even one person you have
depending like the size of your company
or team that are focusing on marketing
are only able to do they're able to do
much more now and do more effectively
but they're still needed businesses
can't just do it with it's not less
resource and say yeah how would you see
that for social media County how does
that work yeah I think a lot of
companies especially smaller companies
are just like entrepreneurs that want to
do everything themselves it's great and
you start with a social media campaign
you start doing email marketing to
potential new customers but then other
things get in the way and it becomes a
third priority and then your last
priority and so consistency is really
key in all of these different marketing
channels so that's where even if it's
someone that you hire for a couple hours
a week just some extra hand there is
really important to keep you on the
track and building momentum in
specific marketing channels and how does
that work for search DVF do you see the
same thing I mean yeah you know I think
there's a lot of times when people will
will look at a tool and say there's the
tool what's the point of view and the
reality is is there is a tool and you
can use it and if you're a small
business I don't think it's wrong to
just hop on a tool and poke I mean it's
what we're talking about right as an
owner
even if you're not a marketer you should
understand what that is because hey like
there are a lot of consultants in the
world and they cost a lot of money and
so if you are gonna hire a consultant
you're gonna hire a full time staff
member understand the channel and
understand how what might be good for
you but that being said I mean for any
of the channels and digital marketing I
think the biggest piece comes actually
in the backend with the analytics
because all of these tools what they let
you do is push something out and
understanding was it worth pushing out
should I do it again is it optimizable
or should I just cut it when should I be
looking at this information what do I
need to be looking at it suddenly
becomes a very big beast of knowledge
that you don't have and that those
platforms don't want to give you because
what they're giving you is a very
simplified version of 10 if 10 people
clicked what does that mean you know did
a tree fall on forests big exactly yeah
and I would I would add to that I I
think that with all those tools being so
widely accessible I actually think it
opens up a lot more opportunity for
marketers because I think it's a little
bit what you said like people have these
stools they dab around in them a little
bit and then they say like wow there's a
whole world of possibilities here yeah I
don't have the time or the resources as
you suggested I cannot do this myself I
cannot keep the consistency that I need
so I need help and help from a
specialist that does this all the time
really is essential there and I think it
opens up lots of opportunities for
marketers so in that respect I think we
have yeah we have just a great world of
opportunity ahead of us
and that helps I had one more question
that I really would like to get in as
well from one of our students Lara who
says I've been looking at digital
marketing jobs and many require
technical skills in HTML Java WordPress
and some asked for programs like Marketo
for instance is that movies
is it essential to have those skills
will we meet them absolutely to get into
digital marketing roles what's our
opinion around that and I'll start with
you Sam should I know your job leaves
closed at all stools and yeah I mean
having technical skills is definitely an
asset because a lot of times not knowing
these languages or technologies can can
block you from doing your job you become
dependent on designers and developers to
help you execute your campaigns so
anything that you can kind of take on
yourself will just increase your output
in your velocity I'm surprised to see a
Java on there but but HTML like CSS are
pretty like simple and easy to
understand especially when I think the
the thing to clarify is as a digital
marketer that's not going to be you know
40 hours a week spending you know
developing HTML from scratch really
you're just going to be going in and
have enough knowledge to be able to
modify something that's existing and
that'll increase your your speed and
knowing tools yeah absolutely like
because if you're trying to get a job at
a company that's using Marketo and you
can say you've worked with it before
they just know your learning curve is
you know that much less steep and you
can get ramped up right away so it's
good to have experience with these I
don't think it's a blocker but you're
just so much more powerful if you know
enough to be dangerous there yeah I
would say for us yo Java again yeah but
the rest of the rest of the things that
Laura mentioned they are really
important SEO is just as technical it is
creative and if there's no way around it
ultimately you can do yourself a lot of
harm if you don't have at least some
kind of working knowledge of these
technologies how they interact and I
think to kind of go further on Sam's
point it's not about working 40 hours a
week or becoming an engineer or being
able
website it's about contextually
understanding those pieces when it comes
to your own work and how it can impact
your own work so you can speak
intelligently to web development team
for example or a designer and you can
say hey I need this to be you know this
element needs to be rendered like X
because otherwise it will be invisible
you know things like yeah you you need
to be able to speak intelligently
because they can't be expected to know
why it's important to your job to do
something in a certain way so if you
don't care if you if you are willing to
sit back and wait I think digital
marketers tend to be more appraoch t'v
and we tend to want to just get stuff
done as fast as humanly possible because
we want the fastest results we can get
because at the end of the day we drive
revenue so you want you want to be able
to take on as much as you can so you can
push forward and you don't you remove
those blockers for yourself yeah yeah
and from your point of view Kali is the
technical part important yeah echoing
what salmon Dibya have said I think some
technical skills are necessary for
social media content perspective
Photoshop or whatever there are plenty
of online tools like canva or other
websites where you can kind of figure
out how to create visual content that
way and Photoshop pretty much I just
taught myself figuring out things I
probably do things on Photoshop the long
way but there are plenty of YouTube
videos that explain that as well as when
it comes to actual software tools like
maybe you don't have experience with a
job description will say Adobe Omniture
experience for analytics but you have
experience with Google Analytics it's
really just seen explaining to the
company like what experience you do have
and how it relates to them you know when
it comes to technique of skills yes and
I would I would agree with that because
if I look at if I look at my own skills
my own careers I'm not I'm not an
engineer I don't have all the technical
chops to like build a website from
scratch I indicated I cannot do that yet
i yes I do understand how they fit in I
understand elements of them so that I
can help direct someone else to execute
on elements that are very core to their
skill and
job so helpful to know it helpful to
understand how you fit in and I also
feel that many of the tools I've learned
once in the job so that I need yes you
have experience in Google Analytics it
so happens that they use Adobe's suite
of analytics products then you translate
what if learning Google Analytics and
you are in that in that new - same for
my CAD or you can actually translate
some skills you've learned elsewhere
into the Marketo tool and most of these
have good education materials sitting
with them so you can catch up pretty
easily yeah I would just advise just not
be afraid of whatever sounds a little
bit more technical because it's often
easier to learn than you think yeah the
word technical freaks people out
expectation on digital markers to be
technical is very low yes I would agree
with that in general but that is that is
true I think in general in jobs in
digital marketing really it's about
having the digital marketing skill way
more than the technical so when you
start and as you go through your career
you'll touch on techniques more often in
technology and then you will build some
of that as you go so I wouldn't be
afraid of it I definitely not let job
descriptions that have that in the
requirements stop me from applying if I
don't have that skill specifically
because they usually don't expect you to
develop the website and all of that so I
definitely would not be afraid of it
scrappie marketing trick that I probably
shouldn't say her question that was kind
of bugging me a little bit is this
Marketo or insert platform young and
it's a little bit crazy if you don't
have that experience and they want
someone who can ramp up quickly then how
can you show that you could ramp up
quickly and it would be fine and a
sneaky way to do that is that a lot of
these products have public demos and
then the like you said have education
materials on them so you can build
yourself familiarity with these tools on
YouTube on public demos if you're extra
annoying you can see you can set up a
demo yeah free trials etc and there's so
many ways to get access to those tools
and have absolutely no reason to be
accessing them including enterprise
tools because you know
lots of people do use them and you can
show that like hey if I came you and I
said hey Sam I've actually never used
Marketo but I've sat through a public
demo I read all their education
materials and I'm pretty confident that
I could get up or any cuz I know Google
Analytics suddenly you're like right
that's not a problem
and I think that builds up your
confidence it builds up kind of yeah in
an interview that will come across
really well yeah I just want to add
these programs and but like the
technical skills you need should not
have all be intimidating they're
designed for digital marketers to jump
in right away
so HTML experience for example let's say
you're in MailChimp and you're looking
at a template you toggle over to an HTML
view and you can just change words for
example or change a color it's very
simple don't at all be intimidated by
these things it's designed to make you
just give you more flexibility and have
more fun doing your job so jump in it's
it's fun it's not intimidating
I would I would agree with that and I
think with that Commons I think we'll
wrap up and I would love that I would
like to thank you for joining me this
morning making it super busy because I
live to it and I see you do it all day
long so I know that you're in very busy
roles and we love the support that we
get from all of you at Udacity I would
like to tell our students that the
discussion will continue on our slack
channels for those of you who are part
of our DMM d program we'll also keep our
