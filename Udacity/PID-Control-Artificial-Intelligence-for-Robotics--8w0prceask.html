of this lesson called PID control PID
control is a vast field in control and
many many classes can be taught about
this one subject matter so what I do is
they give you the very basics and let
you implement the very basics and I
promise it'll be fun you'll be able to
drive a car around and the Google car to
the present date uses a version of this
exact same controller that's of course
much more tuned to the specifics of our
car but you get to see some of the
essence of what it means to control the
car so here's the problem
consider the following car with the
serial front axle and two non steer with
wheels in the back and say we wish this
car drive along this line which is the
output of a smooth that we just
discussed
let's assume the car has a fixed forward
diversity but you have an ability to set
the steering angle of the car how would
you do this you would keep the steering
constant you will be random steering
commands or you could set the steering
angle in proportion to what's known as
the crosstrack error which is the
lateral distance between the vehicle and
the so-called reference trajectory so
the third possibility is steer in
proportion to this cross track error CTE
choose one of those that you think are
best suited to control the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
