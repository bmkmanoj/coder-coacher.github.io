table the next steps are to figure out
how to do lookups as well as adds both
lookups and adds depend on the same
first step we need to find the right
bucket so that's what we'll do next so
remember the idea for a hash table so we
have a list of buckets each bucket is a
list of entries and each entry is a key
and the list of values so regardless of
whether we want to do lookups and added
and find the value associated with the
word or we want to do add and add a new
value associated with the word the first
thing we always have to do is find the
right bucket so if you find the right
bucket if we're doing a lookup the next
thing we're gonna do is need to look
through all the entries in that bucket
to find if there's one that matches the
keyword if we're doing add we also need
to start by finding the right bucket
then we're going to look through and see
if that word already exists if it
doesn't exist we can add a new word and
we'll have a new entry with that word
and that tell you so both of those
depend on first being able to find the
right bucket so we'll do that once and
be able to reuse that code and both
lookup and add so we're a goal is to
define a procedure and we'll call it
hash-table get bucket and it'll take two
inputs so let's take a hash table and a
keyword and it will output the bucket
where that keyword could occur we don't
know yet whether that keywords actually
in the table it might be somewhere in
that bucket it might not but the
important thing that hash-table get
bucket should do is find the bucket one
function that will be useful for doing
that is the hash string of procedure
that you defined earlier and hash string
takes two inputs it takes a string which
is the keyword and it took a size the
number of buckets and it outputs the
number which is the index of that bucket
there's a bit of a mismatch here that
you'll have to think about to define
hash-table get bucket that hash string
the input is the size the number of
buckets it's a number the two inputs to
hash-table get bucket are just the hash
table and a keyword so you need to also
figure out how to get the size of the
hash table to pass into hash string and
if you remember the structure of the
hash table you should be able to figure
out how to do that
remember our hash table is a list of
it's so the value that we want to pass
in to hash string is the size of that
hash table the number of elements in the
list of buckets that is the hash table
so see if you can define hash-table get
bucket and as a hint you can do the
whole definition with a very small
amount of code it should only take one
line to do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
