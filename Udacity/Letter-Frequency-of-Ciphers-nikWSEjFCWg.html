trying all possible keys we can use the
frequency of letters for example here is
the frequency distribution of English
letters now let's do an exercise
together with the frequency distribution
of English letters can we figure out the
plaintext for this following ciphertext
to star we notice that the letter Q here
in the ciphertext is the most frequent
and we know that in plain text English
the letter E is the most frequent so
there's a high probability that Q is in
fact the plaintext letter e then we can
look at the three-letter words for
example here and here now we know that Q
is a in fact e so both ending e these
two three-letter words so most likely
one of them would be the th e the other
one would be our ar e so here we're
going to start to use the knowledge of
English language in other words what are
the common words or what are the
legitimate words in English to help us
uncover the plain text for example we
can see if we say H is a and R is there
then we have a two letter words here H R
in this case if H is a and rst that will
be act which is a commonly used two
letter words in English and also if H is
a then we have this three letter word
that has two letters the same so if H is
a then this can be all so we can
continue with this process by using our
knowledge of the English language to
uncover the plain text here we use both
the frequency distribution of the
English letters and our knowledge of
English words to help us if you continue
with this process
you should be able to uncover this
following plain text we will meet in the
middle of the library at noon all
arrangements are made in practice in
addition to the frequency distribution
of English letters we can also consider
the frequency of letter pairs or even
triples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
