it as a giant two-dimensional array of
colors it's a little tedious to work
with the colors because they have red
blue and green components here we'll
just use grayscale each element in the
two-dimensional array will represent a
gray level as an integer between 0 and
255 now here's the problem that we want
to solve we have a photo which is
represented as a 2-dimensional array of
lots of gray levels and now we want to
make it a little block here when I have
groups of 4 neighbors like this I want
to compute the average color or rather
the average gray level off these 4
pixels and color them all in that color
in essence I'm making every pixel a bit
fatter let me blow this up a little to
hear of a pixel and I want to know what
are its three neighbors to the right to
the bottom and diagonally so let's
assume the one that I'm starting with
his pixels IJ that means my row is I and
my column is J let's look at the one to
the right the row number is the same and
the column number has increased by one
so here it is in Java same row column
increased by one what about the one to
the south in this case the column index
J is the same and the row index has
increased by one so here's the Java code
for that
finally the diagonal one has both the
row and column index increased by one
and I'll leave it to you in the next lab
exercise to figure that out so go ahead
and program this exercise you need to
traverse the first pixel here then you
jump by two each time and also with the
columns you go down by two columns each
time in each step you average these four
pixels compute the average value and
stick it back into all four pixels don't
worry they're friendly relations have
given you some code to start with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
