conflict the partial order planner has
decided to promote this goal over that
one as it tries to connect these two
plans it finds that there is an open
condition problem that we just talked
about on robot ladder does not match on
robot floor so now it needs to select an
operator whose first condition will
match this state robot on floor and
whose preconditions will match this
state robot on ladder and there is just
one Operator that matches those
conditions and that operator this
descent ladder so now the partial order
planner uses this information to select
the operator descend ladder and now we
have a complete plan so now you know
about the algorithm for partial order
planning and how it works in practice
but what does this tell us about
intelligence let's consider several
postulates first knowledge is not just
about the world knowledge is also
control knowledge that is often tacit
well as control knowledge helps us
select between operators second that
goals provide control knowledge goals
can be used to decide between different
operators and we select an operator that
helps us move closer to the goal third
we can view partial order planning as an
interaction between several different
kinds of agents or abilities each agent
here represents a small micro ability
there is this agent which was
responsible for generating plans for
each of the goals independently then
there was an agent responsible for
detecting conflicts between them then
there was a third agent responsible for
resolving this conflict so we can think
of partial order planning as emerging
out of interaction between three
different agents each one of which is
capable of only a small ability so we
can think of partial order planning as
emerging out of interaction between
three agents where each agent is capable
of only one small task Minsky has
proposed the notion of a society of mind
a society of agents inside an
intelligent agents mind that work
together to produce complex behavior
where each agent itself is very simple
as in this case a simple agent for
detecting
- a simple agent for resolving conflicts
and of course in Asian for making simple
plans with simple goals it is one other
lesson to take away from here when you
and I solve problems like the ladder in
the ceiling problem we seem to address
these problems almost effortlessly and
almost instantaneously so it looks
really simple what AI does however is to
make the process explicit to write a
computer program that can solve the same
problem is a very hard it is hard
because the computer program must
specify each operator each precondition
each state each goal every step very
very clearly and very very precisely by
writing this computer programs this air
agents at console's problem we make the
process that humans might be using more
explicit we generate hypotheses about
how humans might be doing it which is a
very powerful idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
