mental diversity if everyone is a
40-something white man with a beard
we're just not going to think in enough
different ways to have interesting ideas
or to pick my ideas or your ideas apart
now there are certain things that are
triggers for us so if we're in the
middle of a conversation and you worked
at parked for two decades and you're a
mems expert and in the middle of me
interviewing you you mention offhandedly
that you built a helicopter in your
garage I already know before the
interview is done we're going to hire
you there's just no question that
someone who has that deep technical
knowledge but fundamentally is a maker
who has a deep excitement about trying
to make hard interesting complex things
that's the kind of person who's going to
fit it x but i'll give you another one
that i do i say to people here sell me
this oh hey thirsty so you've already
passed the test what the test isn't
actually how well you sell it but when
you take an engineer and you ask them to
do something which is not fair it's not
a normal engineering thing a lot of
engineers will go like this they don't
want to have to do something which is
not an engineering thing that wasn't a
fair question what I care about is
whether in that split second I see the
flicker in their eyes that says I
embrace weirdness or I reject weirdness
the people who are going to work well at
X embrace weirdness they don't reject it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
