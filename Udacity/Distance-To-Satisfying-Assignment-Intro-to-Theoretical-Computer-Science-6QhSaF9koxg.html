this is that we start out with a random
assignment that has a distance of n half
to the satisfying assignment again
assuming that assignment exists so by
distance I mean the number of variables
that we need to flip we can expect this
to be about an half as we just found out
each time this algorithm here goes
through the loop there's two things that
can happen the first thing is that we
move closer to the satisfying assignment
and by closer I mean that we gained one
more variable that is set to the same
value as it would be in the satisfying
assignments so basically making a step
forward happens with probability one
third but of course as we also just
found out we can also make a step
backward and kind of flip the wrong
variable and the probability for doing
that is at most two thirds let's do
worst-case analysis here so we will
erase this one here and say in a worst
case we make a step forward with
probability exactly one third and we
make a step backward with probability
exactly two thirds and how often do we
make this step well the loop here is
executed three n times so what happens
is the following we start off here with
our random assignment and then 3 and x
we either move forward with probability
1 third or we move backward with
probability two-thirds and then the next
time assume that we are lucky we have
moved forward we again move forward with
probability one third and backwards with
probability two-thirds and this goes on
and on and on and on until we either
reach the satisfying assignment or which
is much more likely we don't reach the
satisfying assignment we might even get
get farther away from it actually
chances are pretty good that we are now
the nasty thing here of course is that
we move forward with the lower
probability than moving backward so the
probability of coming from a random
assignment to the satisfying assignment
by running the algorithm once actually
doesn't seem too good and the exact
probability analysis here is somewhat
complicated especially if you haven't
had an intermediate course in statistics
yet but what we can try to do even if
the statistic analysis is maybe a bit
complicated is at least to a simulation
so I wrote a program
to do a simulation for me assuming you
start at a distance one half from a
satisfying assignment what is the
probability of making n half steps in
the right direction if the probability
of making a step in the right direction
is one-third and the probability of
making a step in the wrong direction is
two-thirds and you try three n times and
I ran this for different values of N and
here's what I got now of course when you
run such a simulation yourself you might
get a little bit different results but
you will be more or less in the same
range I hope here are the results that i
got for N equals 10 you end up at two
point eight percent probability of
making n half steps in the right
direction for N equals 20 it's 0.08 four
percent and you can see that it rather
quickly decreases now my question to you
here does the probability decrease as a
function of n again logarithmically with
n linearly with n or exponentially with
n</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
