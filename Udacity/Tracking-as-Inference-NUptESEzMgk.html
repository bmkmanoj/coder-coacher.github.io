intuition but getting a little more
formal so here we have the same person
walking at time T and then there's a
question of what what do we do at time t
plus 1 and the idea is that from time T
we have some prediction or some belief
that's indicated here in red of where we
think the person is okay and that's our
prior so before we take any measurements
at time T plus 1 this is our belief by
the way I will go back and forth the
slide sometimes go back and forth
between whether we're talking about
moving between t minus 1 and T or T and
T plus 1 it doesn't matter it's just
going from one step to the next and
sometimes I screw up one way sometimes I
screw up another way this is like the
story of my life alright so it read we
have the ideas we have some predictions
at time T and we want to know what's
happening at T plus 1 at time T plus 1
we take a measurement that's what's
shown here in green okay so we had some
distribution that was our belief about
what's there and now we have some
measurement now notice that this
measurement is also a distribution we're
going to talk in a little bit about what
that means it means two different things
one you can think of is that given that
the person is someplace how likely would
be the current measurement that I got so
you see here let's assume the
measurement was there okay this
distribution says not how likely is the
person at a particular place that's what
I'm trying to estimate what this
distribution says is how likely with
this measurement be how likely would I
be to get this measurement if the person
was at these different locations that's
a little confusing when we do the math
of likelihood that will become clear for
now you can think of a measurement
that's just a little bit noisy I don't
know you know it gives me some bounds on
where the person probably is and then
finally taking that prior belief or
prediction and the measurement I come up
with what's referred to as either a
corrected prediction final estimate or
the technical term is the posterior
distribution as to where I think it is
and that's what's shown in blue so I go
from a prior or an old belief to
measurement
to a new belief</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
