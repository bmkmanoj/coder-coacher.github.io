scheduling works let's see how it
interacts with things like if conversion
recall that if conversion works like
this
we had some code and then there is an
if-then-else which means there is a
branch sometimes we do this sometimes we
do this and then we go back to doing
something after the if then else let's
say this is the orange code and let's
say that this is the green code before
if conversion we can easily reschedule
code within here we can also move things
around within this we can move things
with around within this and we can move
things around within this but it's hard
to mix the code from these together for
example take an instruction from here to
fill a stall here because if we end up
going this way that instruction doesn't
get done so it gets a lot more
complicated
however after if conversion we do the
stuff that was before the if then else
we then have the orange code predicated
so that it only results in execution and
then we have the orange code predicated
one way greens or code predicated the
other way and then the stuff after the
loop and now because this is for branch
free code and because all of these
instructions really execute every time
it's just that they're predicated
sometimes we can easily take
instructions from here and put them here
to avoid stalls and that's nice we can
even take instructions from here and put
them here or instructions from here and
put them here for that matter we can
even take instructions from here and put
them here so overall we get a lot more
opportunities for filling stall cycles
with something useful so if conversion
is one of those things that it helps
with branch prediction because you avoid
branches and it also can tremendously
help the compiler in making a better
schedule for a processor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
