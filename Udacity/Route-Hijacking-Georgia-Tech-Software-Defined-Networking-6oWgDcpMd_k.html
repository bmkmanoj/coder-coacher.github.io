rate of the code red one version 2 worm
which ultimately infected 350,000
vulnerable hosts note the shape of this
curve the worm is effectively dormant or
spreading extremely slowly for quite a
period of time and then there's an
inflection point at which point the
infection rate becomes exponential at
some point then infections slow and the
infection rate ultimately plateaus
presumably after all of the infected
hosts have been found we can actually
model the spread of these worms using
the random constant spread model if K is
the initial compromised rate n is the
number of vulnerable hosts and a is the
fraction of hosts already compromised we
can now express the number of hosts
infected at a particular time increment
in terms of the machines already
infected and the rate at which
uninfected machines become compromised
so if n da is the number of newly
infected machines in dt we can express
that in terms of the number of machines
already infected which is n times a so
these are the hosts already capable of
doing more scanning and now k times 1
minus a is the rate at which uninfected
machines become compromised in a
particular time interval DT if we solve
for a the fraction of hosts compromised
which is effectively the y axis of this
graph then we get the following you get
an exponential curve that is exponential
where the growth rate depends only on K
or the initial compromise rate this is
very interesting because it tells us
that if we want to design a very fast
spreading worm then we should design a
worm such that the initial compromise
rate is as high as possible so how do we
increase K or how do we increase that
initial compromise rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
