technique for asynchronous work pass a
function to another function and then
call the callback function at some later
time when some conditions have been met
this works well but there are some
questions without obvious answers for
instance how do you handle errors it's
best practice to assume that any
operation could fail at any time it's
doubly important to assume so with
Network requests if an error occurs here
should you still execute the callback if
so what value should it receive if not
then what should happen what if it's a
JavaScript heir should that be handled
any differently than a network error
there's no clear answer node basically
makes error first callbacks mandatory
but that doesn't really solve the
problem it's still basically your job to
define and implement an error handling
strategy assume that everything happened
just fine no errors and then this
callback runs when the onload handler
gets called great now you've chained
together two pieces of work but what if
this callback is also an asynchronous
operation and you need something else to
happen afterwards do you pass another
function with another callback here this
is one scenario that leads to something
called the pyramid of Doom a dreadful
situation where there are nasty nasty
nested callbacks within callbacks within
callbacks this looks ugly and it's hard
to write but the real sin is that it is
incredibly frustrating to debug this is
the same kind of code but written with
promises and oh my it looks nicer you'll
be learning all about the beauty of dot
then later in this course
for now just read this and appreciate
the fact that you can figure out what's
happening here despite the fact that you
haven't even finished this course that's
pretty awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
