of shoes on by females equals average a
2 colon 88 we get 30 3.14 here let's
calculate the average pairs of shoes
owned by males looks like one guy owns a
lot of shoes we get 18 here will
calculate square deviations for females
and in column d squared deviations for
males in cell c2 we'll put equals a two-
dollar sign a dollar sign 10 so we're
subtracting the mean and then square it
this time let's just drag it down now we
have all our square deviations we'll
take the sum of squares and divide by n
minus 1 which is six there we have our
variance and if we take the square root
of the variance we get the sample
standard deviation now we'll do the same
for males and then we get that the
standard deviation is 30 4.27 if you're
very comfortable calculating this step
by step you know exactly what to do and
you don't have to remember anything or
review how to do it then feel free to
calculate the standard deviation using
the function stdev if we write equals
stdev and then put the cells a 22 a 8
then we get the same thing and same here
equals stdev we want the standard
deviation of the pairs of shoes owned by
men B 2 colon b12 that's a good way to
check your answers but if you don't know
how to do this step by step then I
really recommend to continue practicing
to the point that it becomes second
nature that'll help you remember the
process and understand what's going on
in the calculation of the standard
deviation now we have almost all the
information we need to do the t-test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
