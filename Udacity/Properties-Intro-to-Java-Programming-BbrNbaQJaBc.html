the number of seats the driver name and
the list of passengers for which of
these should we have getters and setters
the number of seats certainly shouldn't
have a setter you can't really change
the number of seats in a car should it
have a getter if you added one it's not
a mistake but there's probably no great
reason for having it I didn't add one
now the driver named definitely needs a
setter because when you look through the
methods there is no way of setting it
otherwise so let's add a setter here is
my setter do any together I think I do
there's no other way of finding out
who's driving this car none of that
other methods make any use of the driver
name I'm assuming it was important since
someone added the instance variable so
let's add together as well here is my
getter and I so often the setter and
together have very simple implementation
what about the third instance variable
you definitely don't want to have
getters and setters for this variable it
would be very odd to have a method that
wholesale replaces an internal array of
a class and you also wouldn't really
want to return it because then you would
give the user of the class the
possibility of changing its contents so
there is a rule of thumb that says that
in general a class does not want to
return any internal parts of its
implementation that a third party could
modify now you've seen a bunch of useful
patterns that hopefully will help you
designing the implementation of the
class and we'll put those to good use
when we implement our car share
application but before we do that there
is another technical topic that we need
to tackle namely variables and methods
that don't belong to objects but to the
class as a whole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
