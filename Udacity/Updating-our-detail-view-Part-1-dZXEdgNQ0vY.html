the first element is the tool bar now
styled in white the second set is a view
reminiscent of the today view and the
third set contains additional weather
detail some quick measurement shows the
top set of today elements is one and a
half times the height of the bottom half
of the detail elements sounds like a job
for a linear layout with weights inside
of the sets we see some interesting
Android layout techniques to space
reviews are in place above and below the
vertically center the contents of the
today styled view following the rules of
material design we see 16 DP spacers
being used liberally in the vertical
direction along with 32 DP spacers in
the horizontal direction for the details
but we're still missing the core of
these layouts it would be pretty easy to
build the top one with a nested linear
layout and slightly tricky with a
relative layout but it turns out that
both of these sections are built with
only one layout each a grid layout grid
layout was added to Android for the Ice
Cream Sandwich release its goal is to
address the limitations of androids
nested layouts which fall into three
basic categories firstly the inability
to control alignment along both acting
simultaneously performance problems and
hierarchies that are too deep especially
when you're using expensive features
such as layout weight and unsuitability
for design tools that support freeform
editing and yes we are looking at you
relative layout as its name suggests
grid lab uses rows and columns to layout
views you can see it adjusts the grid
automatically as controls in the
right-hand column get larger using grid
layout you give constraints to each view
as well as specify what to do with the
extra space in the cell using the grid
layouts own version of layout gravity
the grid layout that attempts to
preserve the constraints as it solves
the problem of laying out the view
Android lollipop added the ability to
grid layout to reapportioned space among
its child views automatically using
layout weights fortunately the support
library lets us use this latest and
greatest version of grid layout grid
layout is a separate support component
it requires a separate entry in your
Gradle dependency list here are a bunch
of layout elements in no particular
layout if we place the
outs into a default grid layout it
became similar to linear layout although
it aligns text the baseline by default
we didn't have to put the height or
width of each into the layout XML
because grid loud assumes wrap content
here is the underlying grid produced by
this layout changing the orientation of
vertical makes it perform very similar
to a vertical linear layout and here is
the grid produced by that layout
changing things back to the default
orientation of horizontal but giving the
grid layout a column count of two causes
grid layout to automatically place the
child views in two columns here's the
underlying grid produced by this layout
explicitly setting the icon view to the
second layout row first layout column
causes the grid layout to move the cloud
icon to the first column in the second
row and continue laying out all other
views from there here's the underlying
grid produced by this layout but even
better we can use layout column span to
have the date span both of the columns
here's the underlying grid produced by
that layout now we can distribute the
extra weight across all columns by
adding a layout column way to all of the
columns note that you need to add this
to all layouts in the column and each
row for it to have the desired effect
and here's the underlying grid produced
by this layout we can tell the grid
layout to Center a view horizontally
within its sell by adding layout gravity
equals Center horizontal by adding this
to each layout we get this effect note
that the two columns aren't exactly even
because we only distributed the extra
weight between them it looks close
because they contain similar sized
elements you can really see that in the
grid produced by this layout material
design defines these default styles
these sizes and styles were developed to
balance content density and reading
comfort under typical usage conditions
consider using these tiles whenever
possible is it will help you make good
design decisions the support library
provides the definitions for all of
these font styles here's how you would
reference the display for 112 SP style
in the text appearance of a text view
we're going to do our best to make
sunshine use as many of these styles as
we can while
learning the new design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
