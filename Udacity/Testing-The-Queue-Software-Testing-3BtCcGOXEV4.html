but I've provided is the Q code we've
already seen and also three test
functions the first test function is one
that I wrote and let's just go through
it really quickly so it creates a three
element Q checks that it's empty that is
to say it calls the empty method and if
it's not empty that is to say if the
empty method doesn't return true we
print testimony and return otherwise we
keep going so we in Q at n make sure
that that succeeds in Q the value 11
make sure that that succeeds call the DQ
method which takes the first thing out
of the Q that we put in which is 10 so
we make sure that it's 10 DQ the next
element make sure that it's 11 and now
we check again that the queue is empty
if all of these are true then we print
test 1 ok so that's my test function
your test function is our test two and
three so let's just make sure that
everything works here well run the code
and we see the test 1 okay a test - okay
a test 3 okay so your assignment is to
write functions test2 and test3 so just
a little bit previously I gave some
examples of several different tests for
the Q that were equivalent to each other
in a sense that if we ran one of them
then it was just about as good as
running the other one so if you remember
for example we can accuse some numbers
and EQ them and check that they are
correct the Q code would behave exactly
the same if we did the same exact
operations but with sleeps in between
them so what you're going to do here is
the opposite of what I was showing what
I want you to do is write test functions
two and three so that they're not
testing equivalent functionality in the
Q this should be pretty easy but let me
just go up and look at the code and
we'll get some ideas about how that
might work so what kind of behaviors in
the code could you trigger that I didn't
trigger well that's pretty obvious for
example I never triggered the full case
for NQ I never triggered the wrap-around
case I never triggered the empty case
for DQ nor did i trigger the wrap-around
case for the head pointer so given those
ideas write functions test2 and test3
such that they are not testing
equivalent q functionality as the test
one function that I wrote</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
