the user ship is so diverse we're going
to need a road map to guide us on our
journey throughout this course we'll be
referring to what CAG or the web content
accessibility guidelines 2.0 mechag is a
set of guidelines and best practices
which have been put together by
accessibility experts to try and answer
the question of what accessibility means
in a methodical way several countries
actually mandate the use of these
guidelines in their web accessibility
legal requirements mechag is organized
around four core principles the first is
making sure users can perceive content
this helps us keep in mind that just
because something is perceivable with
one sense such as sight that doesn't
mean that all users can perceive it
second is it operable can users use UI
components and navigate the content for
example something which requires a hover
interaction cannot be operated by
someone who can't use a mouse or is
using a touchscreen third can users
understand the content also can all
users understand the interface and is it
consistent enough to avoid confusion and
finally is it robust enough for the
content to be consumed by a wide variety
of user agents and does it work with
assistive technology together
this forms poor while we tag provides an
extremely comprehensive set of
guidelines to help us keep many facets
of accessibility in mind it can also be
a bit overwhelming to help mitigate this
the web aim group has distilled the
wicked guidelines down into an
easy-to-follow checklist targeted
specifically for web content the webbing
checklist can give you a short
high-level summary of what you need to
implement while also linking to the
underlying akattak specifications if you
need an expanded definition both mechag
and the checklist cover a lot of the
accessibility space but guidelines can
only ever be a limited proxy for actual
accessibility what actually matters is
the user experience not just checking
some box so while these guidelines give
us a framework for thinking about
accessibility there may be places where
they're incomplete or even give advice
which is a little out-of-date however
there's still an
excellent resource for helping us
integrate accessibility into our process
with these tools in hand we can chart a
direction for our accessibility work be
confident that so long as our project is
meeting the outlined criteria our users
should have a positive experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
