this problem and actually has a couple
ways the first one we're going to talk
about it's called Cass
which basically stands for check and set
and this basically makes two different
it adds to commands to the protocol one
is called gets this takes a key and this
is instead of get and what this returns
is the value plus what they call a
unique which is basically it's like a
hash of the value or a counter it's it's
some value that's unique specific to
this to this value in memcached and
there's another command called casts
with six a key a value just like set
would and also a unique and basically
the way this function works is for the
key that you're setting if the unique
matches the unique that came out of
memcached overwrite it with the value in
return basically true but if you don't
pass in a unique or the key isn't in the
cache or the unique has changed don't
set it and return false so basically
what this allows you to do is it gives
you these two commands that prevents you
from from two people overwriting the
same key in the cache so if we have two
app servers so if they both run this
memcache that gets on a particular key
at the same time you know they'll get to
return values they'll get the value I'm
going to call that V and the unique
we'll call that u and if one of these
app servers updates key by calling Cass
he wants to update key to the variable
stored in Y using the unique you this
will succeed it'll return true and if
this guy tries to do the same thing all
memcached will only accept one write at
a time it doesn't very very fast but
only do one right at time so if this guy
tries to run the exact same code I'm see
that Cass I'm going to set key to a
variable sort and why passing in you
this one will return false because this
for this app server got there first and
and the unique value stored in memcache
changed you know what both these app
service would really do is that the code
would look something like this you know
R equals and then like well R equals
false then you have like you V equals MC
gets R equals MC dot casts okay
why you so you have this loop where you
basically you know get
the new get the new unique out of the
memcached and then try to set it and
then once you're setting the unique that
you got out of memcached
or that is the unique that's stored in
memcache now matches the one that you've
got out you know that you made the
correct edit now generally you only use
this when you're doing kind of a
destructive operation to the cache like
you're updating a list you know if
you're just overwriting something you
don't need to worry about it but if
you're kind of manipulating an object
and the order of manipulation matters
you can use something like casts and so
what I'd like you to do is go ahead and
implement these functions and our fake
memcached</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
