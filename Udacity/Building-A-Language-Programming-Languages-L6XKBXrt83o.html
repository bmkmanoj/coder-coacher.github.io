about today came from Elise and at least
we got really excited by the discussion
that Wes was having with the CTO of
Mozilla and she wants to know how do you
create a programming language what goes
into it well the good news is that's
what we're doing in this course we just
happen to be creating all the materials
needed to interpret and run programming
language that exists and that is
JavaScript and interpret HTML which is
just how to display something but that's
that's how you build a programming
language exactly what we're doing in
this course the only difference is is
that you would change the syntax and all
the features to how you would want it in
language of your choosing but this is
the course and I hope by the end you'll
get a very clear picture of what would
go into doing such a thing all right
well thank you for your answers Peter
and thank you all for your questions
thank you as well and thank you for
being here Andy thanks to everyone
everyone gets thanks see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
