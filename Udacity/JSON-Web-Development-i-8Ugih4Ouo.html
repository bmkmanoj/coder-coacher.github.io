straightforward I like your blog to
output JSON instead of HTML or rather in
addition to HTML when the URL ends with
JSON let's see how this looks in real
life here is the blog online in showing
the ten most recent entries if I were to
add that JSON to this URL and load this
URL I would get a wall of text and you
can see in here there is some JSON it's
a list of dictionaries in each of these
dictionaries is one entry we'll look at
the JSON for one entry so it's a little
bit more clear if we were to go to blog
entry 1002
which is just this short little entry
and add JSON to this we see that it
returns just a dictionary with the keys
content equals what a great body created
equals this date last modified equals
this date and subject equals what a
great title we'll be looking for content
and subjects in your response you should
try to also include the dates keep in
mind that this date is not built into
the the JSON library in Python you're
gonna have to actually encode this
yourself remember when we talked about
that stir F time function and one of the
previous homeworks well that's a that's
a good use of the store F time function
to create this little date string
because remember the JSON data types
don't include dates they just include
integers floats strings boolean's and an
annul so you have to figure that out and
so I'd like you to have dot JSON on both
the permalink for the permalink URL for
a blog entry and the entire blog itself
and of course you should also have new
posts that continues to work so if we
were to enter a new post in here and
submit this we were to go to the JSON
for this post we would see the JSON
representation here's our JSON one last
thing I'd like to point out to you if I
were to open up our little debugger and
Chrome here and reload this page we were
to inspect this request the response has
a content type of application slash JSON
car set utf-8 it's important to get the
content type right here we're not
sending HTML anymore we're sending JSON
and this is the appropriate content type
to use when you're sending JSON so make
sure you set this header as well
okay when you have all that working
enter you URL here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
