+ odd equals even now one of the rules
of the way we form numbers is that we
don't want to have a number that starts
with zero so even could be say 34 35
that would be a perfectly valid set of
digits to fill in for the word even but
it shouldn't be 04 05 because we just
don't normally write numbers with a
leading 0 so I excluded that how did I
do it so i did a regular expression
search for the regular expression / b
which matches at a word boundary B
stands for boundary and then I'm looking
for a 0 followed by any digit 0 to 9 and
I'm looking for that within F and I want
that to be not true so if I took this
string here something plus something
equals 0 405 and I did this regular
expression search it's saying find me a
word boundary a boundary between a
letter and and or a digit and something
that's a punctuation or something else a
word boundary followed by a 0 followed
by another digit it would say yes indeed
that search does succeed and it succeeds
right here the zero and the four-match
and I want that not to succeed so I
would return false I would rule out this
case where we have a word starting with
0 and 4 and I did that one just because
it's good form that normally you don't
allow valid numbers to start with a0 and
also because in Python we could come up
with an error because of that here's the
problem in a Python program the string 0
1 2 corresponds to an integer
the integer it corresponds to is not 12
it's 10 why is that well it's an old
historic historical accident way back in
the 1970s the C programming language to
find it that way where they said any
number that starts with a0 is going to
be interpreted as an octal number which
means base eight and so 0 1 2 means 1808
squares and two more so 8 plus 2 is 10
and so that would give us the wrong
answer if we allowed octal numbers to
sneak in where we were expecting decimal
and it would also give us a possible
error if we had the string 09 that gives
you an error because that's not nine is
not an octal digit so to avoid all those
problems I put in this regular
expression that says anytime you see a
leading 0 just rule it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
