Alice's vertex cover a little bit
smarter so let's look at Alice's vertex
cover the main thing that happens the
key idea is that we're going just going
to try every single possible assignment
of a cover to the underlying graph so
for let's say for let's say that graph
we might try this this and this or we
might try this this and this or just
this or maybe all of the vertices the
point is that we're not specifying an
order to check the vertices in we're
just saying check every single one what
if we did though what if we decide to
check the vertices in order of size that
is we're checking the covers in
increasing size so first we check a
cover with zero vertices in it that is
no cover at all then we check every
cover with one vertex in it so let's say
this one then we check this one then
this one and so on and after we're done
with that then we do every vertex cover
with two vertices in it so this and this
this and so on and we keep going
checking all of the covers in increasing
order that way once we've found a
possible cover we know that that is the
minimum possible cover and we can simply
stop there now my question then is does
this change how the underlying algorithm
performs so let's go down the questions
first does the new algorithm on average
check fewer assignments than the
original second does the original
algorithm sometimes look through fewer
assignments and by that I mean does it
look through fewer assignments in the
original algorithm at least once next is
the worst-case behavior of the new
algorithm in O notation better than the
original and similarly for the best case
and the average case of the new
algorithm
in O notation are they better than the
original please check all either true or
false</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
