may look similar but our hemispheres
differ in size shape and function thus
even though the cerebrum is divided into
two equal hemispheres we now know that
the left hemisphere processes
information in a focused and analytical
manner and the right hemisphere
integrates information in a more broad
manner we see that insights and
solutions to ideas are more likely to
occur in the right hemisphere
however the hemispheres do not operate
independently let's look inside so I can
show you why this is here we have the
corpus callosum this is a thick band of
fibers that connects the two hemispheres
and this ban allows for extensive
communication between the two
hemispheres this is really important for
things such as logical thinking even
creativity from research we know that
the biggest functional difference
between the two cerebral hemispheres is
language both speech and language
abilities involve the left hemisphere
however they involve different parts the
first neuroscientists to discover this
was a man named Paul Broca he found that
a man who had a stroke could understand
language but could not speak
grammatically correct sentences this man
had what we call aphasia which is a
deficit in the ability to speak or
comprehend language due to his research
the part of the brain that's responsible
for our ability to actually produce
speech is named the Broca's area the
part of the brain that's responsible for
the ability to speak in meaningful
sentences and to comprehend the meaning
of speech is named the Verna Keyes area
it was discovered by Carl Wernicke if
there's damage to this area the type of
aphasia that results from this is fluent
grammatical streams of speech
however they have no meaning so they're
grammatically correct they just don't
have any meaning to them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
