sub-lists and we saw before when I drew
it out that we wanted two arguments the
big list of people that I'm going to
invite to my party and the people that
I've selected so far as we make
recursive calls to sub lists the big
list of people I've yet to invite will
shrink and then selected so far the
people who've showed up to my party may
or may not grow they may show up or not
so this is a recursive procedure and
every recursive procedure needs a base
case or a stopping condition if there's
no one left to invite then i'll just
print out the people we've selected so
far remember when i drew the tree at the
bottom there were eight answers when i
get down to the end i want to print out
each of those eight answers if the big
list is not empty then it has at least
one element the current element i'll
call it and then here i've just put the
rest of the list which is everything
after the current element may be empty
may have more things in this recursive
procedure we're going to call ourselves
two times there's one case where the
current person responds to our dinner
invitation and ends up being one of the
people we select and there's another
case where they do not and that's
actually it here's a test program my
dinner guests are Lucretia Mott
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and susan b
anthony and i'm going to call sub lists
and the big list of people is dinner
guests and the people i've chosen so far
is nothing let's see if this works and
in fact we got just the answer we wanted
there's one world where everyone shows
up one world where no one shows up three
worlds with just one person and three
worlds with two people each for a total
of eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
