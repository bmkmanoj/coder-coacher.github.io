make one of these charts though I make
my gauge gauge monitor well we're almost
there
okay so your report now I'll search for
attendees again and there it is
festivals with attendees Oh create
alright and this is again it's a lot to
look at at first so think of a report at
its lowest common denominator hmm it's
just like a spreadsheet so down here in
the whole preview area yeah
this is going to show you some of the
records not all of them like right now
it's showing festival name attendee
names it's not showing you all of them
it's just doing a little preview of what
the report would look like now so on the
Left sidebar you can drag all of those
different fields which are fields on
festival and attendee into your report
so we can see summarized data about so
what would drag is like if I dragged in
well what's something we'd care about in
our gauge report money right total spent
so grab that off of the attendee object
okay and there's a few places where I
could drag it it doesn't matter um you
can put it anywhere and you can keep
dragging and dropping reordering this as
you go okay I get it so this is
basically a spreadsheet and I'm just
choosing which columns to show exactly
so let's pick a couple other fields like
what are a couple other fields that you
might want to show in this report like
maybe they wouldn't necessarily come up
on the dashboard or the graph that we're
trying to show but if you were to hand
off this report to an executive or a
manager what are things that they'd care
about seeing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
