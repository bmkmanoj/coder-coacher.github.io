computing base has to do whether we take
the security colonel approach or we
don't but we largely sort of focused on
what it has to do when we say revisiting
assurance what we really talking about
is well how well does it do that as the
example we used before somebody's trying
to sell you a an operating system which
is as we said is the de facto trusted
computing base and they're making all
kind of claims about how rusted it is
when we say we want sort of the love to
get get a sense of the level of
assurance somebody has to sort of
convince us so let's just sort of
quickly talk about a couple of sort of
ways in which assurance can be provided
well one thing they can do is saying you
know we did implement it it is a
software system but we extensively
thoroughly tested it so testing is
normal testing you do it for right
functionality things like that but
there's also been testing or penetration
testing penetration testing basically
refers to so do you come with the
adversarial mindset saying what
vulnerabilities can I discover in this
system if you can better is to actually
have a roof that cannot be refuted you
have a formal verification you know it's
a theorem that we prove say this is what
my system is supposed to do and here you
can check that it does exactly that and
and nothing else other things we can do
is you know some sort of a checking that
developers have actually implemented all
the requirements that we had and we
talked about bunch of different
functions that are trusted computing
base or have requirements for a trusted
computing base so when it comes to
assurance and comes to testing a word of
caution here we should look into what
exactly does testing give us in terms of
assurance so remember testing is good
for showing that there is a problem
testing obviously cannot demonstrate
absence of a problem you can't say well
I ran all these tests so there are no
problems okay tests can only demonstrate
problems that you can find and the
variety of testing I'm testing is
something that we do fairly frequently
in
in the software development process in
the QA process quality assessment
process and one kind of testing for
example is regression testing that said
when we enhance the system add features
to it patch it all it's a new system
it's a different systems or regression
testing said you run the tests that we
had to make sure that that these
alterations that we did or the changes
we made don't break functionality or it
could be performance however the key
takeaway from here is really the first
two bullets which is you know testing is
important is useful to discover problems
it is you done a lot of testing it
increases your level of assurance or
confidence but of course it doesn't
guarantee that there are no more
problems that may be left with the
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
