virtual index physical tag cache
aliasing avoidance quiz we want no
aliasing which means the index bits have
to come from the page offset the page
has two to the 13th bytes so the page
offset has 13 bits in the address
breakdown for accessing the cache that
means that our index and offset for the
cache need to fit in 13 bits the 16 byte
block size means that the cache block
offset is 4 bits that's how many bits we
need to tell us we're into 16 bytes we
are and that means that we have 9 bits
for the index we can use fewer but that
would make the cache even smaller we
cannot use more because then we would
get aliasing so the maximum cache size
will be when it has 2 to the 9th sets so
we have 2 to the 9th sets times 2 to the
4th bytes in each block times it's a
4-way set associative cache so we have 2
to the 2nd 4 blocks in a set so this
basically bytes per block blocks per set
how many sets and that amounts to 2 to
the 15th bytes in the cache so the
answer here is 32 kilobytes which is 2
to the 15 bytes so we cannot have a
cache that is larger than 32 kilobytes
and yet it avoids a liasing with these
parameters know that really these two
have to be equal to the page size
because 2 to this number of bits times 2
to this number of bits has to be equal
to 2 to this number of bits so really
the maximum size of the cache here is
the page size times the associativity
and the only way to avoid aliasing in a
cache while making it larger is to
increase the associativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
