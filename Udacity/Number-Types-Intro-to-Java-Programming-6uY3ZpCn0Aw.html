office today it would be relatively
small so we can probably get away with
an int and we would write that as 123
the number of gallons used could be
pretty much anything we don't know what
it's being used for so it could be 2 or
2 million it probably doesn't have to be
an integer
you could have 2.5 gallons of water so
this should be a double and we could
write it as 123 point or 1 point 2 3 e
to either one of these would work for
initializing this variable pageviews or
the number of pages of a website viewed
by users this quarter could be a very
large number think about how many
YouTube videos get watched but it has to
be an integer number because it's a
count so I would use a long and when you
initialize along you would use something
like 1 2 3 L half-life a measure of how
long it takes a signal from a
radioactive oxygen isotope to decrease
by 1/2 is another double there's nothing
to guarantee that this would be an
integer value we could initialize this
again using 1 2 3 point or 1 point 2 3 e
2 and for this case and also the gallons
case we could have just written 1 2 3
that would work as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
