quickly cover how the web works what
exactly happens when you type a URL into
a browser and why all of this matters if
you want to use d3 so far we've been
experiencing d3 through our web browsers
console and have been manipulating
elements that have already been on the
page well this is all fine and good this
isn't anything we can't do easily with
existing libraries or technologies
what makes d3 special is the ability to
easily load and manipulate data often
from external files or sources and in
addition to being the way that the d3
data loading functions work what I'm
going to cover with respect to the
client-server model is actually how most
of the Internet in the world wide web is
possible and worked so well typically
everything that happens in the internet
happens between two or more computers
most often your laptop and some external
server and without going into too much
excruciating detail the way the world
wide web works is by creating a network
of all the computers on the internet so
that they can inter communicate let's
say for example that you want to go to
the d3 homepage located at d3.js org and
load the index.html page when you type
the address into your browser for
representing here by the Blue Square the
web browser is local on your laptop and
needs to send the request out to the
internet asking for the HTML of the
d3.js home page typically it can be
found on one if not many servers on the
world wide web and the good analogy of
how to think about this process is
actually quite similar to the way the
postal service works let's pretend for a
second that phones and actually the
internet doesn't exist yet if you wanted
a package from a friend in the old days
the really old days you would have to
send a letter to your friend requesting
that they send you let's say a package
with your favorite
book they've borrowed you can think of
the host name in this case d3.js org as
the address of a building or a hotel or
even an apartment complex and the port
of a server can be thought of as a room
or apartment number so in this case in
the analogy of the really old days where
we're sending a letter we would say send
the letter to address d3.js org room
number 80
I wanted to simplify the diagram a
little bit to show this process and
exchange much more clearly again
continuing the analogy of requesting
your favorite book from a friend
assuming that the internet and
telephones don't exist you would have to
send the letter let's assume that you
are the client or in this case a laptop
and you send a letter with both the
destination address and the return
address in this case your destination is
d to J's org port 80 and where your
friend in this case the server should
send your book is in this case a
somewhat arbitrary IP so this is just an
identifier for your laptop and the
somewhat arbitrary port number to send
that package - or rather address and
room number your friend the server
receives this request or the letter for
them to send your favorite book back and
this is called the request typically and
in the response your friend or the
server send you your favorite book back
on the case of a web response there will
be a bunch of HTML to the return address
and once you receive your favorite book
in the olden days you can start reading
or in the modern age of computers when
you receive the webpage HTML you can
render it on your browser and now
hopefully that you have an idea of the
general request and response model of
the client-server model where you the
client or your laptop and its web
browser requests a web page which a
server on the inter
located at the address you request send
you back some HTML in the case of d3
code let's say that we request the index
page from d3.js org on port 80 which is
the default for all web communication or
at least HTTP the server sends you back
an index that HTML webpage composed of
HTML Javascript CSS and some d3 code and
on that page is a chart for to render
remember that I mentioned
anytime d3 loads an external file
through its data loading functions such
as JSON dot CSV or dot TSV it makes a
secondary request to some address it
doesn't have to be the server that it
came from but it often is and what the
server sends back when the web browser
makes an ajax request for some data file
in this case data at json the server
sends back the data in another response
which d3 then loads into its callback
function to either bind to your HTML or
SVG and draw a chart or visualization
based on the data sent back so just to
recap when you initially request a page
your browser requests of the host and
port some web document in this case
index.html that the server sends back in
the HTML page if there's an external
data loading function in d3 such as d3
json an ajax request is made which then
goes back to the same server or
whichever address you specify in the
background once the page has loaded and
waits to run its callback function until
the server sends it its data so it can
then build a visualization with the data
and the JavaScript HTML and SVG that was
sent in the original response</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
