that changes in amino acid to a stop
codon like this is called a nonsense
mutation nonsense because it makes
nonsense after this there's nothing left
it stops translation a single nucleotide
variation or s and V the changes in the
amino acid to a different kind of amino
acid is referred to as a missense
mutation it's also referred to as a
nonsynonymous mutation and in snv that
doesn't change the amino acid sequence
at all from the original sequence it's
called a silent or synonymous mutation
now silent mutations can accumulate
because there's really no selection
pressure on them and they don't
detrimentally affect the overall protein
product so one of the most common kinds
of snv's we find our silent mutation
snv's where someone make code for
availing using a GTA and someone else
will code for veiling using a GTG
because the overall protein is unchanged
there's no direct selection pressure
that can happen on the protein it would
be completely random which of these
alleles would fluctuate in the gene pool
now missus mutations could be
advantageous or detrimental it depends
entirely on which amino acid is replaced
and what it's replaced with remember
structure is function and in this case
it all depends on what the structure of
the amino acid were coming from and the
structure of the amino acid we're going
to and then we have nonsense mutations
which are almost always detrimental
because they're going to shorten a
protein sequence once a nonsense
mutation has been induced everything
past that mutation is not going to be
translated take a look at this long
sequence right here I've given you two
mutant versions they both have nonsense
mutations at TGA here UGA and the
genetic code and a TNG here or you AG it
would be both are stop codons I want you
to tell me which of these two nonsense
mutations is going to be more severe and
then I want you to tell me why in this
text box right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
