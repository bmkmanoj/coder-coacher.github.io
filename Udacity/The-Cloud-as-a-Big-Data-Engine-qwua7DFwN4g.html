it empowers anyone to potentially have
infinite resources as long as you can
pay you can have the resources that are
required to work on maybe hard problems
that involve lots of data and that
require lots of processing here are some
illustrations that I found pretty
informative to illustrate how much of
data are we dealing with in terms of our
everyday life in our world so if we just
think about one year 2011 there were 1.8
Isetta bytes of data that were created
in that one year this amount of data is
equivalent to everyone in the u.s.
tweeting forty three hundred and twenty
times a day pretty much not doing much
else or another way to think about it
this amount of data is 200 billion
high-definition movies that are each
about two hours long if you lived for 47
million years you'd be just about done
watching these two hundred billion
movies or to store this much data it
would require so many of the apples 32
gigabit iPad that if you stack them up
together there'll be 25 times higher
than Mount Fuji pretty powerful these
illustrations and this is all the data
from 2011 only clearly not every
application needs access to all of the
data that's generated that's available
in the world but a lot of the
applications for scientific discovery
for improving social services for a
number of other types of applications
they do require a lot of data looking at
cloud computing as a big data engine
there are a number of layers that are
necessary in order for the cloud to
provide that kind of infrastructure and
those kinds of services that are needed
by these big data applications cloud
platforms that offer as a platform as a
service a stack for big data processing
at the minimum have to have some layer
that enables the storage and access of
data from across many many nodes and
also the ability to
describe applications in a certain
parallel fashion and ideally to do that
easily so that the data can be processed
across potentially many nodes we talked
earlier in this course that access to
memory and access to local memory is
faster than going to disk and
particularly if you have to go to disk
that Maeby's remote that's attached to
another node so most of the cloud stacks
also incorporate some data caching
Claire where the data can be brought in
memory or maybe even across multiple
memories in the distributed system big
data system I said a cloud platform for
big data must incorporate some data
processing framework but commonly when
we talk about small or smaller data the
way we are analyzing it is using things
like SQL queries or some other type of
query ink mechanism and so often
CloudStack big data stacks would
incorporate some language front-end that
would make this data processing a little
bit more easier one common thing that
people do with big data that they
analyze that they search for certain
patterns so they perform some data
mining operations that often involve
common functions such as some machine
learning algorithms so just as it's
common for cloud big data platforms to
support popular language front ends it's
also common for them to support popular
analytics libraries and also a lot of
the types of the data that we're
interested in isn't just created once
and then that's it that's a complete
data set instead there's continuously
generated knowledge and then potentially
the answers from the analysis on that
knowledge are derived continuously and
updated over time so therefore a common
service that needs to be incorporated in
big data clouds would be something that
provides a streaming abilities both as
inputs or NS outputs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
