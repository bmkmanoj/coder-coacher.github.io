associative caches so now let's go from
the other direction which is let's first
look at direct mapped cache 'as if this
is the memory and it contains blocks 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 etc and these are the block
numbers not the addresses so I'm
assuming that this thing here is an
entire block worth of memory which
contains multiple locations and let's
say we have a cache with room for 4
blocks we can number the lines 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
and in a direct mapped cache block 0 if
it's in the cache at all needs to be in
line number 0 block 1 if it's in the
cache at all will be in slot number 1
block number 2 if it is in the cache at
all has to be in this place here block
number 3 if it is in the cache at all
has to be here and now block number 4
will again get to map to line number 0
block number 5 maps to line number 1
block number 6 maps to line number 2 etc
so pretty much for any given block
address there is only one place in the
cache where that address can be if we
look at a memory address the least
significant bits are still the block
offset they tell us where in the block
are we assuming that we find a block the
block number now contains some bits dec
tell us where in the cache this block
can be the index bits need to be
sufficient to tell us which of the lines
in the cache are we talking about so if
there are 4 lines in the cache then we
need 2 index bits to tell us where a
block and map and that is why in the
block number it was 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 etc
was determined by the lowermost bits of
the block number and the remaining bits
of the address are now the tag now there
is an interesting question of why the
tag does not include the full block
number so why doesn't the tag cover also
the index bits and the answer to this
you
that the tag needs to tell us which of
the blocks do we have in this place and
the answer is that the tag needs to
identify which block we have in the
cache considering that the block with
some index bits has to be in one place
in the cache the tag for that place in
the cache doesn't need to tell us what
the index bits are by looking at this
particular line we have already
determined that these index bits have to
be the ones that correspond to that line
so all we have to do is tell us which of
the lines that can possibly be here do
we really have and for that we only need
these bits because the index bits are
pretty much predetermined once we are
already looking here in other words if
we stored the index bits in the tag all
of the tags that we could possibly put
here would have the same index bits
which means we don't have to store them
because we already know that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
