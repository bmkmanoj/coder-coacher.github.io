have been a lot easier to read and a lot
more useful if we used names to keep
track of values instead of writing out
those big numbers especially numbers as
big as the speed of light Python
provides a way to do it it's called the
variable we can use a variable to create
a name and use that name to refer to a
variable so the way to introduce a
variable is using an assignment
statement and an assignment statement
looks like this we have a name followed
by an equal symbol followed by an
expression after the assignment
statement the name that was on the left
side refers to the value that the
expression has the name can be any
sequence of letters and numbers as well
as underscores as long as it starts with
a letter or an underscore so here's an
example we could create the name speed
of light and we can assign to it the
value of the speed of light in meters
per second so after that assignment
the name speed of light refers to that
value one way to think of that is to
have an arrow so we can have the name
speed of light and that's a name which
refers to value and the value at or
refers to is this long value which is
the speed of light and meters per second
so once we've done the assignment we can
use the name and the value of the name
is the value that it refers to in this
case it's the speed of light in meters
per second so let's try that in the
Python interpreter so here we've
introduced the variable speed of light
and we've assigned to it the value
299,792,458 the speed of light in meters
per second and now we've got that assign
in a variable instead of having to type
out that whole number we can use it
directly when we print out the speed of
light it will be the value that that
name our first two so we'll see instead
of seeing speed of light
we'll see the 299 million value here we
can use it in expressions as well so if
we want to convert it to centimeters
instead of meters we can multiply by a
hundred and now we see the result is the
speed of light in centimeters per second
so let's define another variable this
one will define billions which means one
divided by a billion that's hard enough
to remember how many zeros to type so
it's nice to have that in a variable and
now we could define Nano stick does the
length of grace Hopper's nano stick
as the speed of light times a billions
that would be the length of the nano
stick in meters if we wanted in
centimeters we can multiply it by a
hundred and so now we've defined a
variable nano step which is the length
light travels in a nanosecond in
centimeters and we can print that out so
variables are really useful they're
gonna make our programs a lot easier to
understand they also mean that we can
use the same expression changing the
values of the variables to compute
different things so now it's time for a
quiz to see if you understand variables</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
