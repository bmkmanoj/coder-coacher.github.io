equation again which again is one of
these alpha based things and just to be
clear I really do mean you know alpha
sub T here that we're doing this over
time we're updating our learning rates
as we go it's just sometimes it's a
little irritating to put that that there
but but yeah so let's imagine that we're
doing that we're we're we're using that
same kind of weighted process bumping
the values around so what would based on
what we just talked about Charles what
would this actually be computing well it
would be computing the average value
that you would get for following you
know a kind of optimal policy after you
take this particular action yeah this is
trying to go to this expected value and
what is that expected value so the
linearity of expectation says that we
can actually move the expectation break
the break up the sum using the
expectation so this the expected value
of the reward is actually rms mm-hmm the
gamma is going to come out because of
linearity of expectation and now what
we're left with is the expectation over
all next states of the maximum estimated
value of the estimated Q value of the
next state but what is this distribution
over S prime it's the distribution that
is determined by the transition function
right so it's this which is you know
this so that's good it's I'm kind of
cheating though do you see how I'm
cheating I think I know you're cheating
to tell me well so when I told the story
about this alpha arrow updating thing I
said that it converges to the expected
value of this quantity here but this
quantity here since it's Q hat it's
actually changing over time right so
this target is actually a moving target
its changing over time so we can't quite
do this analysis because the first step
is a little bit questionable but it
turns out that there really is a theorem
that this simple update role this Q
learning update rule this tiny little
one line of code actually solves Markov
decision processes yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
