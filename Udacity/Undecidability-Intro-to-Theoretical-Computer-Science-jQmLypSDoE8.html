okay so programs can become so
complicated that no algorithm can decide
whether they run infinitely or not so is
there a short program for which I could
show you
undecidability well yes there is such a
program it's not very practical but it
is an example for undecidability for a
very simple program here's a simple
example of a problem that is actually
not decidable although it's very simple
to write so the input to that problem is
an integer and we'll just call that
integer I and the output is the number
of iterations that it takes to get to a
equals 1 using the following two rules
if I is even then set i to i have so we
divide by 2 if I is odd set I to 3 I
plus 1 just two simple rules and so for
example when we start out with I being
10 then we first apply the first rule we
get down to five fives odd
so the new value is 16 then we divide by
2 we divide by 2 we divide by 2 we
divide by 2 so we have one two three
four five six iterations so I equals 10
then the answer is 6 so now we're going
to let you play a little bit with this
algorithm and then discuss the
undecidability for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
