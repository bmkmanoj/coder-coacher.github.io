it's quite possible that some things
went wrong and you got some nasty error
messages when you learn a new language
be it a human language or a programming
language errors are a fact of life let
me show you some common errors so that
you can recognize and fix them here is a
typical error have a quick look and see
if you can tell which part is wrong that
can't be right the terminal window
object was system dot out dot system dot
out let's see what happens if one makes
such an error you may want to work along
with me here in bluej open the errors
project and open error one here is the
error let's compile and the compiler the
program that translates Java into
lower-level code complaints and says it
has no idea what the variable outch is
the compiler knows system dot out it
doesn't know system dot ouch such an
error is called a compile time error
because it's found when you compile some
people call it a syntax error because
there's something wrong with the syntax
of this statement here as you can
imagine there are lots of syntax errors
you could make you might forget the
semicolon you might forget one of these
quotation marks or both you might forget
one of these dots anytime you do that
the compiler will complain and you just
fix that particular error and recompile
it happens to the best of us now here we
have a different kind of error again
have a look and see if you can guess the
programmer misspelled world let's see
what happens in this case when you
compile there's no error the compiler
doesn't know English and it has no idea
that this part has been misspelled we
can run the program and it runs it just
does the wrong thing when a program
compiles and runs but it produces the
wrong output then that's called a
runtime error some people call it a
logic error because there's something
wrong with the logic of the program not
just its syntax now have a look at this
statement it also has an error what do
you think will happen when you try to
compile and run a program containing
this statement do you think it doesn't
even compile
do you think that it compiles and runs
but then prints the wrong value like in
this case or will it compile and run and
then print an error message or will your
keyboard melt into a puddle of plastic
if you have blue jay open right now just
give it a quick try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
