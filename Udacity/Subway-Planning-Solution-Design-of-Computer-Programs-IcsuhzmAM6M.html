decided I'm going to return something
that looks just like the successor
function only it's going to have all
possible successors so it's going to be
a dictionary of this form for any
station that you ask me four stations
are states in this problem all you need
to represent state in this problem is
what station am I currently at each of
those I'm going to give you a dictionary
that looks like a successor function and
that is it has a combination of state
action pairs so the state is just going
to be the neighbouring station and then
the action is the line that you take so
for example if I'm at boden then one of
the state's I can arrive at his
government and the action I take to get
there is follow the blue line how do I
do that well one thing is I import the
collections module I use collections
default dicked so I'm saying successors
is a dictionary and by default if
there's a value that isn't there the
default is going to be a dictionary so
here's what successors look like and the
default value if I ask for the value of
a station there's nothing there make it
be an empty dictionary the the line
items are a set of line stops pairs so
I'm going to go over those line name and
stops then I'm going to look at all the
overlapping pairs Bowden government
government state state aquarium that I
get by splitting up the stops in to list
on spaces and then I'm saying a
successor of going from A to B from
Bowden to government you can do that
along the line name and similarly going
from government devoting you can do that
along the line name your blue then
return the successors overlapping pairs
takes any sequence and just gives me
those payers so if you give me this
sequence of this turned into a list the
overlapping pair is our first Bowden
government than government and state
then state aquarium this is useful here
and it's useful in general here's my
ride function it's now very easy it's a
shortest path search that makes sense I
don't need lowest cost
search because there are no costs here
I'm just going from one station to the
next I start here where am I trying to
get to what the goal is to get to there
so I'm trying to get to some place where
and I just put the function in line here
rather than defining it separately you
could have done it either way because
the functions were short I decided to
put them in line but naming the function
would also be fine lambda s S stands for
state or for station or for stop and we
ask are we there and then the successor
function well we've already built up a
successor function in this subway system
Boston so we just say look into boston
that's a dictionary and look for the
station that i'm currently at and that
will give me a list of successors and
then shortest path search that's less
the rest what as long as ride do first I
have to find all the stops and that's a
little bit complicated because I've
hidden them away in this dictionary for
the system but I can go through with
this generator expression to come up
with a set of stops and then I just
iterate through all possible stations a
and B look at 4a and all possible stops
and 4b in all possible stops generate
the the you ride the shortest path
search between them and then take the
longest out of all those shortest paths
and that's my longest ride</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
