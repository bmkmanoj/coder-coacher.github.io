add 2 to both sides then we just need to
divide both sides by 3 so now we have T
equals one-third times log base two of 3
plus 2 well what do we do with this we
know that we want to find out what
number this is equal to but our
calculator doesn't have a button for log
base 2 that means we need to convert
this log base two of 3 into something
that's either a natural log or a log
base 10 I'm feeling in a natural log
mood so let's do that now that log base
two of 3 will be equal to the natural
log of 3 over the natural log of 2 so
let's substitute this into this spot
okay so now we have T equals one-third
times the natural log of 3 over the
natural log of 2 plus 2 this is
calculator appropriate so let's pull out
the calculator I'm just going to enter
all of this in I have one-third times
the natural log of 3 divided by the
natural log of 2 plus 2 and here's what
that equals T is about equal to 1 point
1 95 awesome we went through a ton of
steps to get to our answer but we did
arrive there eventually and along the
way you got to practice a ton of
different techniques that you've learned
throughout the entire course awesome job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
