can add to your Android project unit
tests and connected tests the primary
distinction between the two is that unit
tests run on a regular Java VM on your
computer and connect the tests run on an
Android device or emulator in general
you should use unit tests for testing
generic non Android related classes in
fact since unit tests are run against a
mock Android SDK implementation any code
that calls the Android API will fail in
this case you should either use a
mocking framework like maketo to mock
the appropriate Android dependencies or
use a connected test instead
additionally you can configure the
testing options in your Gradle build
script to instruct the mock Android
implementation to return default values
rather than throw an error in any case
it's up to you as a developer to decide
how the best write your tests and how to
structure your code in such a way is to
make testing easier connected tests
should be reserved for testing logic
that depends on Android api's or for
more high-level testing like integration
and functional tests remember connected
tests are packaged as an apk that will
be installed on an android device or
emulator so there's typically more
overhead involved in their execution
both unit tests and connected tests have
their own source sets named tests and
Android tests respectively the notion of
variants extends to tests as well
allowing the right tests specific to a
particular build type or product flavor
the naming conventions for these source
sets follow the same pattern as for
application code except for the test or
Android test suffix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
