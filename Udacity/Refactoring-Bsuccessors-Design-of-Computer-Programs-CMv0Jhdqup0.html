bridge successor function I want you to
write a new function we'll call it B
successors 3 which takes a bridge state
as input but we're going to represent
the states in a different way we're
going to represent them not as a set
that included the light because in the
old bridge successor function bridge
successor - it just seemed kind of
complicated then I had to deal with a
special case of our the the elements of
the sets on the here and there side are
they people or are they the light it
just got a little bit overly verbose and
I think maybe there's a better
representation so we're going to try
different representation we're going to
try one where there is a set of people
on the here side a set of people on the
their side and then the light is going
to be an index it's going to be 0 if the
flashlight the torch is on the here side
and 1 if it's on the their side and then
the tuple for the actions is going to be
a little bit different it's just going
to be a set of people the travelers that
are going and then followed by the arrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
