ship otherwise to maintain coherence
between our caches that are very very
fast we would need to look up a
directory in very very slow memory which
kind of defeats the purpose of having
these caches some of the questions about
this directory are easy to answer like
for example where is the home node where
we go to find the directory information
about the block and the answer to that
is the same tile that has the last level
cache slice where that block would be
because if the directory entry for that
block indicates that none of the private
caches have it then we want to look up
the last level cache to find a block so
we might as well do that in the same
node that has a directory otherwise
there would be a lot of traffic between
where the directory for a block is and
where the last level cache for the block
is so naturally they should be on the
same note but that doesn't really answer
the question of having a directory entry
for every memory block we have seen that
we only keep the data in the last level
cache lights for those blocks that we
actually have in our level three cash
but a directory without any changes
would need to be for every possible
memory block that might ever come into
that slice which is a big problem
because there are a lot of memory blocks
so instead of keeping a directory entry
for every memory block we need to
realize that the entries that are not in
our last level cache or in any cash is
on ship really are not shared by anybody
so we don't really have to maintain that
information so we will maintain what is
called a partial directory we don't
maintain a directory entry for every
memory block instead our director will
have a limited number of entries and
then we allocate an entry in this
limited directory only for such blocks
that have at least one presence bit at
one basically only four blocks that
might be in at least one of the private
caches so for a block for which we know
that it is not in any l1 or l2 cache its
present only in the LLC or only in
memory for that matter we don't need a
directory entry because implicitly we
know that such a directory entry would
just be all zeros but let's say that we
have decided on some limited number of
entries we start allocating those
entries when we put blocks in l2 and l1
caches and eventually we will run out of
directory entries what do we do now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
