the World Wide Web I'll run using
different operating systems
specifications and data structures so
how do we make sure these devices can
all communicate with each other a set of
rules must be in place in order for
machines to speak the same language we
call these sets of rules protocols a
common abstraction for conceptualizing
this is with the open systems
interconnection or OSI model this model
characterizes the communication
functions of the computing system
without getting too caught up with the
specifics of each different type of
computer this allows the model to focus
on the interoperability of diverse
communication systems with standard
protocols the model partitions a
communication system into abstraction
layers the original version of the model
defines seven layers as shown here a
layer serves the layer above it and is
served by the layer below it a variety
of protocols can exist within each layer
but they all have to be able to receive
and handoff data to the protocols and
the adjacent layers a good analogy to
conceptualize this is like sending a
message inside of multiple envelopes the
application layer is the code that makes
the original message it is then passed
on to the layer beneath which wraps this
message inside an envelope each layer
adds another envelope with more
information about preparing the message
breaking it up into small packets
routing the message to its intended
final destination and rebuilding the
message once it arrives once the message
reaches the physical layer it is
transmitted as the stream of bits over a
physical medium physical media are the
wires fiber-optic cables are wireless
signals that you use to connect to the
internet once the message reaches its
intended machine it is now processed in
reverse order such as the application
sitting on the receiving computer gets
the message the same way it was created
by the sender when it comes to
developing web applications and API
design developers mainly focus on the
application layer in the OSI model
operating systems can handle the
complexities of the lower levels for us
in most cases but if you're interested
in learning more about the lower layers
