about done with this course in a few
moments you're going to be introduced to
the requirements for the final project
of the course but before I get to that I
want to talk about quizzes you've
probably noticed that we'd like to put a
lot of quizzes in our courses because
that's just how people learn you're
taking this course because you want to
make your apps faster so it makes sense
for us to give you a lot of sites to
analyze and D djenka Phi as you go
through the course but of course not
every quiz involves you debugging apps
we also like to pepper in quizzes like
these that we hope will give you a
better conceptual understanding of what
you're trying to accomplish I want to
talk about myself for a second when I
started working on this course with Paul
I thought I knew a bit about getting 60
frame per second performance but as we
work together and thought through all
the questions that we wanted to ask you
I realized that I really didn't
understand front-end performance as well
as I thought as any teacher will attest
you don't really understand a subject
until you try to explain it to somebody
else
in fact the act of teaching and deciding
what questions to ask is actually a much
better learning exercise than simply
answering questions to that end I have a
challenge for you can you teach this
course better than us think back to the
questions that we asked you and the
examples that we gave you to work on do
you have an idea for a better question
that could have been asked or do you
have a better app that people should be
debugging or even better do you think
you can stump Paul and me with some kind
of performance question if so head back
to that particular part of the course
and post your question in the forums and
when you do that
start your post with better question
there are two big benefits for asking
questions you'll be boosting your
understanding of performance by thinking
through it a little bit more deeply and
you'll make the course better for
everybody else future students will
practice what they're learning with more
questions and walk away with a better
understanding of performance it's really
a win-win so do you have a better
question than what we've come up with if
so post it in the forums because I
cannot wait to start answering them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
