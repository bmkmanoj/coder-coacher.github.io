going to show you the easy way to do it
which is to use the built-in python type
called a dictionary and what a
dictionary is is really an
implementation of a hash table it's
built into Python so it's much easier to
use then defining our own hash table so
far we've seen two complex types in
Python we've seen the string type and
we've seen the list type now we're going
to introduce the dictionary type so
there many things that are common
between these three there are other
things that are different so to create a
string we could have a sequence of
characters inside quotes to create a
list we use the square bracket and we
could have a sequence of elements inside
the square bracket and the elements
could be any type unlike a string where
they had to be characters so our string
was a sequence of characters our list
was a list of any kind of value so a
list of elements of any value the
dictionary type we're going to create
using the curly bracket and the entries
inside the dictionary our key value
pairs so here I've created a dictionary
with two elements and each element the
key is a string here's the string
hydrogen and the value associated with
that element is the number the keys in a
dictionary can be any immutable value so
they don't need to be strings they could
be numbers they could be other things
the values can be any value so what a
dictionary is is a set of key value
pairs and the property that a dictionary
I'll give us is like the hash table that
we can look up a key and get the value
associated with that key so one
important property of all types is
whether they're immutable or immutable
we saw that the string was immutable
that means once we create a string we
can't modify that string it has the same
value it always has a list was mutable
we could change the values of elements
in the list after we create the list we
could upend to the list adding new
elements to it a dictionary is also
mutable so after we create a dictionary
we could add new key value pairs to it
we could change the value of values
associated with keys we saw with strings
if s is a string then we can do s index
I
that will give us the i'th letter in
string with lists we can do something
very similar if P is a list we can do p
index I to get the ice element of the
list with dictionaries it's a little bit
different the syntax is the same we can
do D index K with both strings and lists
these were numbers here the K is
whatever the key value is so this is a
key in the dictionary what D index K
will give us the value associated with
that key in the dictionary we'll see
some examples soon we can also use our
indexing and assignments we saw with a
list we could do this that would replace
the value of the I element of P with
whatever we have here with a string we
can't do that that produces an error and
the reason we can't do it is because
strings are immutable so there's no way
to modify characters in a string with
the dictionary we can and what the
meaning of this is very similar to the
meaning of update in our hash table so
that's equivalent to update the value
the value associated with k2 bv</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
