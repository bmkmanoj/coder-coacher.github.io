every sequence becomes small this is
true because they're become more and
more sequences every time you flip a
coin you double the number of sequences
they may have varying probabilities but
there are always more of them so the
probability oh it always goes down
you're always multiplying in a number
less than 1 that's why this assumption
is important the probability of every
number of heads become small this is a
little trickier but this is also true
because as the number of flips increases
the number of heads must increase even
if we're assuming some low probability
for it so it becomes farther and farther
away from what we expect the probability
of every proportion of heads also become
small this is a little trickier but the
thing to remember is every proportion of
heads corresponds to a given exact
number of heads now that exact number of
heads changes as let's say I double the
number of flips I also double the number
of heads I need but that's going to
always be a smaller number since again
there's now the probability that
probability has to be divided into the
chance that I could just have one more
head or one less head which is going to
be an ever so slightly different
proportion now this statement is not
true the probability of every range of
proportions can't become small the range
of all proportions is arranged and we
know that has to stay at one so that
can't be true and the probability of
some ranges of proportions become small
well this will also be true consider
something improbable like getting the
proportion a proportion below ten
percent on a fair coin that's going to
tend to become rarer and rarer and rarer
as you flip it more times because the
same rare or unlikely event has to keep
repeating itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
