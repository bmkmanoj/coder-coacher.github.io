register renaming and how to follow the
true dependencies and so on we are ready
to learn what the instruction level
parallelism or LP is so we will now
define what it is
so the ILP really can be defined as this
IPC instructions per cycle when we have
a processor that can do an entire
instruction in one cycle so it doesn't
need a pipeline it can fetch decode
execute write result everything in just
a single cycle for one instruction also
the processor can do any number of
instructions in the same cycle so
theoretically it could just fetch and
execute your entire program in the one
cycle but it still has to obey true
dependencies so if one instruction
depends on another then they cannot be
done in the same cycle you have to first
one and then the one that needs its
result so as you can see it
LP really is kind of what an ideal
processor can do subject only to obeying
true dependencies how do we compute the
ILP for a program well we first rename
all the registers so we do register
renaming first and then we pretend we
execute so what we do is we say ok in
the first cycle these are the
instructions that don't depend on
anything so they can go in the next
cycle we go through the same thing and
so on until we run out of instructions
to do at which point we know how many
cycles it is now the one thing that you
should remember about the I'll pain that
will help you realize what it is and how
to do it is that ILP is a property of a
program not of any particular processor
so basically we define the LP to be what
would this program do as far as the IPC
is concerned on an ideal processor so it
has nothing to do with what kind of
processor you actually run it on it has
everything to do with just the
dependencies in the program so be
mindful of that because for example it
doesn't make really sense to say
something like what's the ILP on this
program on the I don't know Intel Core
i7 processor because the ILP on the
intel core i7 processor is beside the
point because the LP is really the
performance of this program on an ideal
processor that has nothing to do with
the intel i7 ok so just just dream
member that when you are asked to
produce the LP you should just consider
the program it doesn't matter what the
processor looks like because the LP is
computed for a perfect processor anyway
in contrast you could say that the IPC
of this program on a given processor is
something else but be mindful of this
basically the LP you only need to see
the program you don't really need to
know what the process looks like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
