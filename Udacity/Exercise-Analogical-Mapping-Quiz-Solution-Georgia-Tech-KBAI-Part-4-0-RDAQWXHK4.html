there's a few different ways we could do
the mapping between the Sun the planet
on the left and the nucleus and electron
on the right if we look only at the top
half of each representation all we can
really say is that the Sun must map to
one of them and the planet must have to
one of them because these relationships
are symmetrical if I don't consider the
bottom half it wouldn't matter which is
which if i look at the bottom half the
representations however it tells me
which part of the solar system must
correspond to which party atomic
structure the planet revolves around the
Sun and the electron revolves are on the
nucleus so the planet and the electron
must correspond because both are doing
the revolving and the son of the nucleus
must correspond because they are the
centers of the revolution so the Sun
corresponds to the nucleus in the planet
corresponds to the electron this is
right David another thing to take away
from here is not a depth of
understanding it requires in order to be
able to make the right kind of
correspondences if one did not have the
right kind of model for the solar system
and the atomic structure that captures
the deep relationships then the mapping
may not be done the alignment wouldn't
work and we would not be able to
understand the atomic structure in terms
of the solar system les modèles deep
and rich models of the two systems the
target problem and the source case are
essential to deciding how to align them
how to map them and as we will see in a
moment what to transfer and how to
transfer it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
