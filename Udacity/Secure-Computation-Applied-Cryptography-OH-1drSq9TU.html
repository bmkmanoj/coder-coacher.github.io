let's suppose Alice and Bob meet at a
conference they don't yet know each
other despite the fact that they've been
talking with each other through units
one three six but let's pretend they're
not quite so friendly yet and they both
have their smartphones and on their
smartphone they have an address book and
what they want to do is figure out do
they know any of the same people this is
a pretty common occurrence at
conferences often the way people do this
is the slow where you ever at this place
do you know someone here do you know
anyone there they want to do it more
efficiently so what they'd like to do is
have a protocol that allows them to
compare their address books find all the
people they know in common so in this
case it would match Dennis since they
both know the same Dennis and then they
would see the matches but not reveal
anything else about their address book
to the other person they want to do this
by executing some protocol where at the
end of the protocol both parties would
know the matching entries but not learn
anything else about the other person's
address book more generally we have two
parties a and B they have some private
information they want to perform some
secure computation and at the end of
that they learn the result of some
function on both of their inputs but
they don't learn anything about the
other parties input so now it's time for
a question sort of a trick question but
if you are paying attention at the
beginning of this unit you'll be able to
answer it correctly can we achieve this
property using cryptography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
