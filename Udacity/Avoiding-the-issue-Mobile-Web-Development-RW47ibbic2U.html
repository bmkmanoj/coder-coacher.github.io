lazy and my first reaction is always to
try to avoid the issue if possible
remember anything that the browser is
responsible for rasterizing it can
probably do at the native resolution of
the screen so if you can effectively use
vector graphics like scalable vector
graphics or canvas to draw your graphics
you absolutely should although I do want
to note that by default canvas has a
backing store set to a 1x pixel density
that is it won't rasterize in higher
resolution on 2x or 3x displays you can
change it and get a higher resolution
backing store by setting the width and
height on the canvas to the upscale
dimensions multiply them by device pixel
ratio then scale your entire context or
use CSS width and height to get it to
lay out in the appropriate size we don't
do this automatically in the browser
though if we did canvases on 2x devices
would cost four times as much memory and
3x devices would take nine times as much
memory on mobile devices that might have
pretty limited memory to begin with now
for small icons or glyphs you may wish
to use icon fonts which are a handy way
to get pretty looking icons that scale
well for general prettiness using CSS
features like gradients rather than a
gradient image is a radically good idea
and css3 features like rounded corners
and borders save you from having to
supply custom graphics for each corner
and they have the added benefit of
reducing the number of requests your
page makes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
