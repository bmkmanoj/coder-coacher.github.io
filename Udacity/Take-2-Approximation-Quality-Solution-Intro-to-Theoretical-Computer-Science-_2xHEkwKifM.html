first one is very obvious it's this one
here because the algorithm of course
returns a vertex cover and the vertex
cover can never get smaller than K but
the really useful answer is this one
here the algorithm has chosen at most 2k
vertices where K would have been the
optimum number because each time this
loop is run it chooses at least one
vertex from the optimum solution what
that also means is that it chooses at
most one how to say useless vertex that
didn't have to be part of that solution
so the error that it makes is at most
one extra vertex and it can make that
error at most K times and for that
reason the algorithm chooses at most 2k
vertices which means lad although they
take two algorithm doesn't look very
smart it's actually a factor two
approximation algorithm and guarantees
that the solution that it gives you is
at most twice as big as an optimum
solution so let's now have a look at the
algorithm that seems so sophisticated</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
