going to do this using an example so
let's say we start out with the
following boolean formula x1 or not x2
or x3 and not x1 or x2 and not x2 or x3
and the way we're going to transform
this into a network is we're going to do
groups of vertices for each clause
so for this clause here for this one
here and this one here so this is our
first group of vertices and we're going
to have one vertex for each variable in
that clause so this vertex here is for
the x1 this vertex here is for the not
x2 this one here is for the x3 for this
one here we're going to do another group
this one here is for the not x1 this one
here's for the x2 and for that class
down here we're going to do the same
thing so we have not x2 and here we have
x3 and now we're going to draw a lot of
edges so from each vertex we are going
to draw edges to every vertex in the
other groups with one exception we're
not going to draw an edge if we have the
same variable but one is is basically
the untouched variable and the other one
has a not so x1 and x2 we're going to
draw an edge x1 and x3 we're going to do
an edge and x1 and not x2 also but we're
not going to do an edge here and it
works similarly for this one here so not
x2 not x1 that's something we don't care
about that's something where we draw an
edge not x2 and x2 again here we have
not here we do not have a knot so we do
we don't draw an edge and down here
that's fine and here we have a case
where we have not x2 and not x2 that's
also fine so we'll draw an edge here
it's only if we have a knot and and here
we don't have one
so for x3 we can draw an edge down here
down here again those are the same so we
do draw
that's fine and we'll draw one here now
let's look at those here so we already
have have all the edges I went to this
group so we only need to look down here
and indeed we have edges here and the
same thing is going to happen here so x2
we are not drawing an edge to this not
x2 here and we're drawing the edge down
here and we've already drawn drawn all
the edges down here so this is the
network that we construct now what about
the size of the graph so if the boolean
formula here has polynomial size so we
have n variables or in this case three
variables and we said that we're going
to have the total length of the boolean
formula be polynomial and the number of
variables so if this length here is
polynomial then the network also will
have polynomial size because we have one
vertex for each of the variables that
occur here so the size really doesn't
change that much we introduced edges but
you already know that the number of
edges is quadratic in the number of
vertices that we have so the size stays
polynomial which is already good for our
reduction but now I still need to show
you what satisfiability has to do with
clique we're actually going to do this
as a little quiz so let's say that the
boolean formula has M clauses so in this
case M is 3 but you can consider the
more general case here and then let's
say that the graph that we have
constructed has a clique of size M so
one clique of size M for example here
because M is 3 would be this year all
vertices are connected to each other
there's others that you can find
actually so if you can find a clique of
size M in a graph that was constructed
this way does that graph contain at
least one vertex from each clause group
and back last group I mean the groups of
vertices that we introduced for each of
the clauses from our satisfiability
formula and what I would also like you
to think about is if a clique can
contain multiple vertices from one of
these class groups here so if we could
have a clique say for example that could
contain
these two vertices here or these two
here are in the more general case if we
can have a clique that contains more
than one vertex from each of these
groups here so please check those that
are correct and leave the other ones
blank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
