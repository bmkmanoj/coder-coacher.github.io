during a page fault service so when a
thread is executing on the CPU it
generates a virtual address and the
hardware takes that virtual page number
and looks up the TLB to see if it can
translate that virtual page to a
physical page frame that contains the
contents of that page
now if the TLB lookup fails that's a
mess in the TLB and at that point the
hardware if the hardware is doing the
page table lookup it'll go to the page
table and look up the page table to see
if the mapping between the virtual page
and the physical page is in the page
table and this would have been there if
the operating system has already put the
contents of that page in physical memory
but if the operating system has not
brought in that page from the disk into
physical memory then when the hardware
goes and looks into the page table it
may not find the mapping between the
virtual page in the physical frame and
so that will result in a page table miss
and that miss is the point at which you
have a page fault so your page fault now
that says that I don't have the page in
physical memory and so what the
operating system at that point in the
handler what it has to do is to locate
where on the disk that particular page
virtual page is residing on the disk and
as part of the page fault service the
operating system has to allocate a
physical page frame because it's now
missing in physical memory and do the
i/o to move the virtual page from the
disk into the page frame that it has
allocated and once it has done the i/o
the i/o is complete then at that point
the operating system can update the page
table to indicate now it has a mapping
between that virtual page and the
physical frame number which was missing
in the original scheme of things and
that's the reason that we had this fault
and we handled the fault by bringing in
the missing page from the disk into
physical memory and we update the page
table to indicate that the mapping is
now established between the virtual page
in the physical frame number and then
you can update the TLB to indicate that
now we have the mapping between VP
and pfn and once the TLB has also been
updated the page fault service is
complete and life is good so that's the
whole workflow in taking a virtual page
and mapping it to a physical frame when
there is a mess now let's analyze this
picture and ask the question where are
potential points of bottlenecks now what
I'm showing you here is thread specific
a thread is executing on the CPU and
looking up the virtual page and
translating that to a physical frame is
entirely local to a particular thread
and local to the processor on which that
thread is executing no problem with that
no serialization at that point now
moving over here once the page fault has
been serviced updating the TLB to
indicate that there is a mapping now a
valid mapping between the virtual page
number in the physical frame number that
is done on the TLB that is local to a
particular processor and therefore it
has processed a specific action that's
going on in terms of updating this TLB
now let's come to the middle structure
here this is where all the problem is so
what we have here is the situation where
we have to first allocate a physical
page frame that's an operating system
function in order to allocate a physical
page frame you have to update the page
table to indicate now that the IO has
been complete and now we can have a
mapping between virtual page and
physical frame and I told you that the
page table data structure is a common
data structure that might be shared by
the threads in which case all of these
things what I've shown you here can lead
to serialization so this is what we want
to avoid we want to avoid the
serialization that is possible in
allocating data structures allocating
physical resources in order to serve as
a page fault so what we are seeing here
is entirely lookup and that can be done
in parallel no problem with that reading
is something that you can do in parallel
and similarly what is happening over
here is we're updating the TLB but it is
local to a processor there is no
serialization that's going to happen
here but here
we can have serialization if you're not
careful so as an always designer in
designing this particular service page
fault service this is what you have to
focus on to make sure that you avoid
serialization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
