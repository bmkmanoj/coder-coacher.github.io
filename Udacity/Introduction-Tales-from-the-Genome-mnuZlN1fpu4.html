genome we're really excited that you've
decided to join us on our exploration of
the human experience through biology we
really hope that this is going to be an
awesome learning odyssey that just might
change the way you think about yourself
and others in a fundamental way for
example whether you know it or not the
objects and these two images are
intimately related the image on the
right I think you already know what that
is but the image on the Left represents
a DNA molecule the substance that makes
up all of our genomes all living things
including you are created from their
genomes which are the set of genetic
instructions that seems pretty
mechanical to me well it is sort of
biology is just chemistry that crawls so
you mean like chemistry that comes to
life well yeah what what I mean is that
every physical aspect of who you are is
deeply rooted in the chemical
engineering processes that interprets
the information within your genome
together with environmental influence
your genome and unique development the
chemistry of you is what brought you to
where you are today but I am a
psychology person so it's not just a
physical aspects right what about our
feelings and behaviors well your
physical aspects your size your
metabolism even your behaviors and your
interests even the personality traits to
exactly these are all deeply influenced
by your genomes instructions if you were
to zoom into your body you would see
that you are made up of trillions of
individual cells all different because
they read different parts of your
genomes instructions some are skin cells
that use melanin to protect you from UV
rays from the Sun some are stomach cells
that help you digest products that you
eat and drink others are red blood cells
that carry oxygen to all parts of your
body all of these cells and more use
your genomes instructions to build who
you are you are a giant conglomeration
of cells all meticulously reading the
book of instructions to keep you alive
and functioning forming the basis for
all of your traits now this course will
help you relate your traits to this book
of instructions and show you some really
amazing life stories along the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
