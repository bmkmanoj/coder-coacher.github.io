and the background knowledge this is the
final concept definition for foo there
is particular air agent will learn
notice that there are no must support
links here because the input series of
examples do not require them notice also
that we did not generalize this bricks
into something else or further
generalizes blocks into something else
because there was no background
knowledge to do that so the results of
learning here depends not just on the
input examples but on the background
knowledge that the AI agent has this
method of incremental concept learning
differs quite a bit from some of these
standard algorithms in machine learning
often in machine learning the AI agent
is given a large number of examples to
begin with and the learning begins with
those large number for examples when the
number of examples could be in thousands
or millions or more when you have a
large number of examples to begin with
then one can apply statistical machine
learning methods to find patterns of
regularity need put data but if the
number of examples is very small and if
the examples come one at a time if the
learning is incremental then it becomes
harder to apply those statistical
methods to detect patterns of the karate
input data instead in that case the
algorithm must make use of its
background knowledge to decide what to
learn and how to learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
