air program this example is the second
example and you teacher also tells the
air program this is a positive example
so these are labeled examples here is a
representation of the second example
again I have done the variable ization
so the constant here brick a has been
replaced by brick this was a current
concept definition of the AI program for
the concept of arch and here is a new
example how should the air program
revise its current concept definition of
an arch in order to accommodate this
positive example because it was a
positive example therefore the air
program should try to generalize so one
good way of generalizing the current
concept definition is to drop this link
if the AI program can drop this link in
that case this will be the new current
concept definition note that this
current concept definition covers both
the second example as well as the first
example this is called the drop link
heuristic it's a heuristic because that
we have discussed earlier a heuristic as
a rule of thumb so here is what is
happening when an air program needs to
learn from a very small set of examples
just one example or two examples then
the possible generalizations and
specializations the learning space is
potentially very large in order to guide
the air program about how to navigate
the learning space will develop some
heuristics the first photo stickers drop
a link if you need to generalize in such
a way that the new concept can cover
both earlier examples so the drop link
heuristic is used will win the structure
the current concept definition and the
structure of the new example have a lot
of overlap the overlap almost exactly
except for one link that is extra in the
current concept definition that extra
link can be dropped because in the new
definition will cover both the previous
concept as well as in your example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
