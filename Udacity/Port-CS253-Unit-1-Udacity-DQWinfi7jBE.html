to show you and this is the this the
final piece we'll talk about right now
and that's called the port when you make
a web request to a server this is the
host this is the name of the machine or
the location of the machine you're
requesting in order to make an internet
connection you need two things you need
one the address of the machine which is
represented by the host and to you also
need a port and by default the port
equals 80 if you want to use a different
port you can include it in the URL
between the host and the paths separated
by a colon in this case will be making a
request on port 8000 get used to this
URL because this will be your local
development URL for a lot of this course
and actually for a lot of your career as
a web developer you're constantly
accessing your local machine and you're
probably doing it on something other
than port 80 there are even more parts
to a URL but they're not particularly
relevant to us right now they'll come up
you know as we go let's do one final
quiz about URLs before we move on what
I'd like you to do is take this URL and
identify its main parts host protocol
fragment query and ports</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
