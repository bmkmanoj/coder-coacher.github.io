automatically inserted in the tab order
they can be very convenient to use but
there are instances when you'll want to
modify the tab order like if you're
building a component without a native
analog like this drop-down up here or if
you need to have something off-screen
that should only be focusable when it
appears like perhaps a modal window for
these cases you can use the tab index
attribute tabindex can be applied to any
HTML element and it takes a range of
numeric values a tabindex of negative 1
means that the element will not be in
the tab order but it can be
programmatically focused via JavaScript
by calling the elements focus method
this can be especially useful for
off-screen content which appears
on-screen
in response to a user event when the new
content is displayed you may wish to
call its focus method which will then
direct future keyboard events to it a
tab index of 0 will add the element to
the natural tab order plus that element
will also be focusable by calling its
focus method for example here I've got a
fancy button that I've created out of
just a div now without a tabindex
attribute if I press the tab key this
element will not receive focus by adding
a tab index of 0 now when I press the
tab key
this element gets focused and future
keyboard events get directed to it a tab
index of greater than 0 for instance
something like tabindex of 5 will jump
the element to the front of the tab
order regardless of where it is in the
Dom if there are multiple elements with
a tab index greater than zero the order
will start from the lowest value that's
greater than zero and then work its way
up in general using a tab index greater
than zero is discouraged and considered
a bit of an anti-pattern if you get in
the habit of using it you can quickly
end up with a very jumbled tab order and
it can make things especially confusing
for screen reader users who navigate the
Dom in a linear fashion ideally if you
need to put something earlier in the tab
order the best bet is to move it up in
the Dom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
