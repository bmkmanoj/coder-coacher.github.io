talking about have been mostly system
issues things like reliability
I'd also like to spend a moment talking
about software engineering side of
things that is building these systems
first category of issue has to do with
requirements because non-functional
requirements dominate this sort of
situation the requirements analyst has
to elicit this information from the
customers and of course it's axiomatic
that the customers aren't always sure of
what the requirements should be
particularly with respect to quality of
service that is some kind of measured
understanding of how the system is going
to deal with these non-functional
situations second concern is software
architecture recall I've been stressing
throughout the course that the key
element of coming up with a good
solution architecture Allah is how it's
going to deal with the non-functional
requirements a corollary to that is in
coming up with the architecture and
choosing the connectors how do those
connectors relate to the middleware
solutions that we have can for example
we find an appropriate middleware
technology for dealing with one of the
connectors we've selected to be included
in the architecture third software
engineering issue has to do with some
design questions whenever you have a
distributed application you have a
network whenever you have a network you
have latency that is delays in message
passing how is your system going to deal
at the software level with this latency
are there timeouts are there the
implementation of some kind of protocol
for resending and so on another key
question at the design level as far as
the tributed applications are concerned
is statefulness you know that the web
applications often are stateless that is
every time you interact with the server
the server has to treat your interaction
as a self-contained unit without relying
on any variables retaining values of
course the database sitting there can
serve as a persistent but heavyweight
way of keeping track of state
the question for the designer then is
how they're going to deal with this one
solution is you've seen probably with
respect to cookies that is the server
sends back some of its state to the
client which then returns that
information on the next next interaction
and then there's just the general
question of concurrency how a
synchronization going to be performed
how can you ensure you don't run into
problems like dead like deadlock or
making sure that every one of the pieces
of the system has some kind of
interaction on a timely basis that is
that it's live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
