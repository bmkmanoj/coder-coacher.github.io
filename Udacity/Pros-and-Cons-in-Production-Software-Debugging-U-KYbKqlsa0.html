whether assertions in production code
should remain enabled or not here are
some points to consider first failing is
better than bad data if your program
fails with an assertion you know that
there is an error if it simply produces
a bad result without actually checking
it then this may have far worse
consequences and failing second the more
active assertions they are the easier it
is for you to find the defect third
defects in the field are hard to track
which means an assertion gives you a
chance to find a defect before it goes
into the field in particular in
combination with thorough testing and
even in the field if assertions are
still enabled you still have a far
better chance to find defects because
well you get a failure rather than
producing bed data on the detector side
so what speaks against assertions being
enabled in production code we have
performance performance performance if
you do have a large data structure with
lots of global checks and leave this
enabled performance will suffer however
there's a large number of assertions
which impact performance only in a
marginal way checking if some result is
larger or equal than 0 ranges like
things these will not impact performance
in a measurable way the answer here is
to first leave the assertion zone then
measure which assertions actually do
impact performance and possibly do turn
these off and leave the others enabled
the second thing is assertions when they
fail typically cause the program to
crash or at least abort execution
immediately this is not very
user-friendly you should give your users
a chance to recover even if an assertion
finds that something has gone wrong but
then again if an if your program crashes
because of a failing assertion what's
the alternative the alternative is to
keep on working with bad data and bed
data can produce arbitrary and even
worse results later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
