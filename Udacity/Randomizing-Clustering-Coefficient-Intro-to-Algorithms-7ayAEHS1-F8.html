shortest path in weighted graphs in this
unit there's some I think interesting
questions on the homework for you to get
to know this concept better and to work
with it and apply it to some interesting
social networks I'm going to take this
last topic for this unit to be
estimating the clustering coefficient
this is kind of a different idea but I
wanted to introduce the idea of a
randomized algorithm and we did that a
little bit in the context of the
expected linear time top-k algorithm and
in that case the answer that it returned
was always the correct answer but the
time that it took was actually a random
variable that on average was linear in
the size of the list we're going to now
look at computing the clustering
coefficient approximately this is a
really useful thing to do if the exact
answer doesn't matter very much which
often in when you're doing social
network analysis it doesn't really
matter that much exactly what something
like the clustering coefficient is you
want to just get the the ballpark
whether it's heavily cluster or loosely
clustered or you know slightly more
clustered than the movie database or not
so just getting it correct to a couple
digits is probably sufficient but for
the case of the clustering coefficient
getting the exact answer is actually
pretty expensive so just to remind you
here's here's some code for computing
the clustering coefficient of a graph
with respect to a particular node V so
given a node V are computing the
clustering coefficient involves looking
at all the neighbors of V going through
them one by one and looking at the pairs
of the neighbors for each pair of
neighbors it does a calculation to
compute how connected it is and then
returns a measure of how densely
connected the neighbors are but that's
for each node we need to look at the
square of the degree to actually compute
this so if the degree is rather high if
the if the graph is fairly densely
connected or even if there's just a few
nodes that have a very very high
connectivity like maybe not that many
edges like a star graph for example so
star graph has just linear number of
edges but it also has linear degree at
least in that one node and so computing
the clustering coefficient for that node
is N squared well I guess in this case
then the total running time is not going
to be in cubed because we don't have n
squared on each of those nodes but the
running time is still pretty high and N
squared is pretty high and if this is
actually a densely connected graph like
a click we're talking about n squared
for each of the nodes in the graph we
totals up to n cubed and then cubed you
know for something like the Marvel
Comics graph where we have 6,000 nodes
6,000 cubed is a pretty substantial
number even by current computing
standards so we'd like to have a way of
getting a pretty good answer in time a
lot less than this here's a kind of a
formula for the clustering coefficient
the clustering coefficient of a graph
have to sum all the nodes in the graph
we're going to average it for the end
nodes in the graph and then for each of
those nodes what we do is we sum up for
all the pairs of nodes that are
neighbors of the node B we sum up
whether or not they're connected and
then we scale that by taking the number
of possible connections to over the
neighbor size of V times the neighbor
size of V minus 1 so I want to think for
a second about this this random process
that I've got this brace around here so
imagine that we choose a V at random
from anywhere in the graph and then we
choose a pair of neighbors of that that
particular chosen node V completely at
random from the graph and then we return
either 1 or 0 depending whether those
two nodes are connected what is the
average value of this quantity and
remember the average we're taking here
is averaged over these two sources of
randomness that we're randomizing over
all nodes in the network and we're
randomizing over all pairs so just to
review the expected value of some random
variable X is the sum over all values
that variable can take on the value of
that variable times the probability so
for example for a six-sided die the
expected value that we get by rolling
the die it's the sum over all sides the
probability of getting that side which
is a six times the value on that side
which is the number one two three four
five or six and so from that we can
actually get the name of the average
value that comes up on the dime or the
expected value so given that and if
we're given a V what's the expected
value of C WX maybe I should ask you so
here's a skeleton to get you started I'd
like to know the expected value of this
see this connectivity variable given a
graph G and a node V of that graph and
I'll predefine for you then set of
neighbors of V and the degree of V the
number of neighbors the expression X in
G of W is true if X and W are connected
in the graph so those are the pieces
that you need calculate this value
exactly the expected value of the
connectivity of wnx for randomly unifor
me randomly selected wnx from the set of
neighbors so write that code and we'll
test it for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
