an important part of it that we haven't
focused on yet the first step is the
hello from the client to the server the
second step the server responds both of
these messages include new randomness
and part of the response is a
certificate and then in the third step
the client sends a new random value
encrypted with the server's public key
and at the end of this process the
client and server heads agreed on a
master secret which is used to derive
the keys for communication so the key
question and the goal of the protocol is
for the client to know that it's
communicating with the correct server
and that that master secret is only
shared with the server it intends to
communicate so the question is how can
the client trust that it's communicating
with the server it intends to
communicate with here the choices select
the best answer and I should warn you
this is a bit of an unfair question
since we haven't talked about this yet
but I think you know enough to figure
out the answer based on what you've seen
so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
