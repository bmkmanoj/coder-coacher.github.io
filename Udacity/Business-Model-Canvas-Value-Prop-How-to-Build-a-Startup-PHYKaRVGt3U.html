called the value proposition the value
proposition answers the question what
are you building and for who the value
proposition
says hey it's not about your idea
product it's about solving a problem or
a need for a customer that is what pain
are you solving what gain are you're
creating and more importantly who are
your customers now value proposition is
a fancy word for what product or service
are you building this is where you
normally would list all your features
and here's all the speeds and feeds and
benefits and whatever but we're really
going to be asking a different question
than might have been used to it's not
all about your technology your
technology is just part of the value
proposition customers really don't care
about your technology the customers are
trying to solve a problem or fulfill a
need by the way we'll be talking about
this through multiple lectures the
difference between a problem and a need
is a problem is I have an accounting
problem or I want to use a word
processor and and those types of
products solve a problems but there are
other things that human beings do like I
want to be entertained or I want to have
a date
those are some basic hardwired social
needs or I want to communicate with my
friends like Facebook or Twitter
those are needs these are different than
problems and by the way if you could
find products that solve needs your
total available market as you'll see
later is huge compared to I solve
specific problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
