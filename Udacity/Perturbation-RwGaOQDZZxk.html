had before so you remember in track when
we're doing tracking we had this notion
of dynamics model for Kalman it was a
linear model so the idea is that each
time step we have some prediction that
allows us say well if I have some
density about where I think I am what's
my new density and in that particular
case it had to be linear in order to
make the math work out that was you know
the underlying part of the the Kalman
all right but in general we can have a
more general state transition matrix
right so the idea is that what is the
expected change from time t to t plus 1
ok so if i'm at some point or if i'm
guessing that i'm at some point I could
say what's my expected change so what's
important about this and the reason I'm
going on and on about this is besides
just having sort of a dynamics model
that says how things are likely to
evolve I can also include a notion of
perturbation or control alright so the
perturbation means if I was here maybe I
know that I added I took two steps to
the right now megan is freaking out
again all right back alright so what I
would do is I would say that okay the
the expected state transition is that I
take where I am I take two steps to the
right and then I had some noise so it's
a little bit like remember we talked
about that in the linear model I could
actually have a different linear
transition at every time T but usually
we keep them constant here we're gonna
have the notion of an input and the
input is represented as you you for
input don't ask me if you if you want to
know why I asked some control theory
professor because they always use you as
the inputs or is the desire anyway so
we're going to see a U sub T that's the
control or the input or the perturbation
that got added to the system at time T
and we assume that we know that alright
so what we've done is we've changed our
filtering just a little bit so that
besides just taking observations we're
going to assume we have observations
plus assume that we have um we know what
the
it's are all right lots of words but I
hope you follow that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
