situation when our determinant b squared
minus 4ac is negative or less than zero
the reason this is an issue is because
we know we need to take the square root
of the determinant and right now we have
no idea what taking the square root of a
negative number means none of the types
of numbers we've dealt with so far can
express the answer to this equation so I
guess that means we're going to need a
new kind of number let's look back then
at all the kinds of numbers we have
dealt with here's a diagram depicting
our world of numbers that Julie
introduced in the very first lesson of
the course I know this looks a little
bit different because I decided to use
rectangles as time instead of circles
but all of the sets and subsets have the
same relationship to one another you can
see we have the natural numbers which
are inside of the whole numbers which
are inside of the integers which are
inside of the rationals and together the
rationals and the irrational numbers
make up the real numbers the question I
have for you then is where this new kind
of number we're talking about belongs we
see that the number n is some negative
real number where should we put the
square root of n does it belong in the
natural numbers the whole numbers the
integers the rationals the irrational
numbers or outside of the real numbers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
