variety of issues of dynamic range what
it is related back to also things like
how we can see some details of dynamic
range and now we can capture that kind
of information in real scene we
basically talked about how image
acquisition pipeline is aimed at
capturing the scene radians and we want
to use that converter pixels basically
talked about a variety of linear and
non-linear aspects of the image
acquisition pipeline again remembering
that really what we want to do is
capture the scene radiance of a real
scene and convert it to the pixel values
and how the whole pipeline works and how
we can represent and model this then we
basically talked about the whole idea of
camera calibration which was aimed at
basically using a lot of data a
data-driven method to be able to map the
information about what scene radiance
was and what pixel values were this
allowed us to create a profile that can
be used to then of course to the
opposite given a pixel value what would
be the best ingredients for it then we
basically talked about how to do this
mapping basically how do we go from
pixel values to different exposure
images and render a new radiance map
that captures a scene then we talked
about how tone mapping could be used
take the radiance map then display an
image in the displays that we have
available there is a lot of work out
there in the HDR area I'm just listing a
few of the papers here are the papers I
will make available also on the website
so you should be able to look at them
carefully these are the ones I referred
to in this slot says slide deck and of
course there are lots of software's out
there I encourage you to look at things
like exposure fusion that's an
additional method builds on a whole lot
of stuff that we talked about and builds
on X plant photography and of course
these types of HDR image is now
available on your cell phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
