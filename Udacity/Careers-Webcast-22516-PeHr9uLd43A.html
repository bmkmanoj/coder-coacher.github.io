ahead and we're going to introduce
ourselves before we jump in here my name
is Horatio I'm actually nanodegree grad
I graduate from the android nanodegree
September and now i work at course
manager / Udacity cook at Udacity I am
Rachel many of you may watch with me on
concern opportunities I work with the
careers team I'm the career success
strategist ah pretty much a fancy word
for a matchmaker I came to ask me from
Whitechapel which is a recruiting
platform that helps companies the
candidates get matched based on skill
sets you might see some Rachel
information on us insight we partner
together for a while yeah and we are
here today to simply give you some
insight into what it's like to work with
a recruiter and how how it can benefit
your job search and so many of you guys
have submitted questions when you sign
up for the chat so we'll be sure to
touch on those at the after we kind of
do a live Q&amp;amp;A and then if any of you
guys have questions relevant to what
work
hm submit them what about it will make
sure to address it if you have just
general overall questions maybe you can
read till the end and we'll make sure to
address them then if we have time yes
apparently the feature is disabled now
to ask questions right now but we will
be touching on those questions that you
did submit in the surveys beforehand and
we also be touching on some other
questions that way said before head
humble right now we're sort of debugging
it so that you can ask questions but um
so I was in this position not too long
ago so how Rachel can you tell me about
who exactly recruiters are maybe who
else do I need to be concerned out at
like hire a closet okay so there are two
different types of recruiters for the
most part internal and the external
recruiters so internal recruiters work
for the company and they they are in
charge of essentially hiring directly
for that company so you have to be
itself has people who act as internal
recruiters helping the teams here at
Udacity philibert overall to me hires
there are also actual recruiters which
are more than a third party recruiter
they work for recruiting companies such
as like robert hass or air attack or
can't think of any other names off the
top of my head but they they essentially
have a companies and they work with to
make placements and then they also have
a community of candidates that they pull
front depends on the roles needed I
worked for it was pretty company years
ago and so I have some insight to kind
of how about how that function is what
those relationships are like um maybe
really we'll go into more detail later
but they can be beneficial i know they
get a bad rap but they don't always have
to outside of just who we could regard
you might also hear people talk about a
hiring manager hiring managers
essentially are the ones who are in
charge of posting the job writing the
job description on they are typically
the ones you make hiring decision me to
your future boss maybe not oftentimes
hiring managers work with Department
leads to make the placements and so they
did you work closely together um and
then in the internal energy process you
also will typically get food by
interviewers who our team members
typically the teeny will actually be
working with us about the last you some
questions sometimes its technical
sometimes per euro it just pretends on
each company's actual process it's
awesome so thanks for that Rachel um so
what I don't like some of the common
mistakes people make when talking to
recruiters intersections um well first I
think it's got first mistake is entering
into any conversation with a recruiter
having a negative connotation or stigma
attached to the conversation like I
mentioned earlier often times such as
like external for recruiters kind of get
a bad rap sometimes it's warranted but
it doesn't always have to be it often as
a case-by-case basis for each person as
an individual on the just common
mistakes are would be to put all of your
eggs in their basket and assume that
they are going to be the person to find
you a job and also on the flip side of
that is assuming they're not gonna be
able to find your job people tend to
overlook recruiters or rely too heavily
on them both are very negative both can
be a detriment to your job search if you
rely on somebody else find you a job you
might not find that job because you're
at Columbia able system urgency to make
an assumption about what you want on you
are your own best advocating your job
search you should you should use
recruiters to help you build your
network and get connected the companies
but you should rely on them to find your
job yes this is really interesting
Rachel so on even before we were talking
to your cooties how do we get in touch
with recruiters and how it was the best
way to reach out to cruise yeah so some
as far as an external recruiters go
finding am looking into her Korean
companies um in particular can be
helpful so do some research into the
company
we're recruiters work for so like for
example robert half or air tech like i
mentioned earlier look into them free
food you saw friends you would other
people's experiences being a candidate
for them was and make your decision then
um typically to convey people writing
reviews i found are the ones who have
bad experiences with recruiters to say
they're writing about not what not to do
I'm pretty good with everyone not to do
or with every negative experience
there's a positive off on the flip side
um so really make your own impression or
make your own opinion of them um fine so
you can for recruiting companies you can
actually buy directly to their open
roles you can apply directly to become
one of their candidates which means they
will use they'll take you into
consideration as they get integral thin
and then with internal recruiters you
there's a couple different ways to
connect with them first would be finding
like applying directly for a job they
typically will then be the ones to reach
out to you once they have gone for your
resume your application and it can if
they're interested in connecting with
you they'll schedule a call you could
also that's like the most passive way to
go about doing it if you are really
motivated to work for specific company
um like say for example you really
wanted to get a job at Udacity this is
not necessarily how you would go about
getting a job you ask me i'm just using
it as a sample case one way you could do
it is to find their open roles on the
company's website and then go to
LinkedIn maybe try to find somebody who
looks like either they'd work on that
team or they'd be in charge of like
they'd be in charge of hiring manager on
that role specifically um and then
connect with them and write them an
essay to be really personable don't go
straight to you on a job there but get
to know them and just reach out and say
i'm really interested in what you
working on i'd love to know more about
the problems you're solving and leave it
you never want to be too forward
build affections you kind of want to
just leave it leave it simple simple low
is best and just kind of wait see what
comes of it you can also apply directly
to that role sometimes having like your
name in different pots so you've applied
directly and they see your main that win
and you've also added them on LinkedIn
some deals might know you at that
company it could just worried about help
too and it's kind of like meeting people
and networking okay so there's all these
different ways to reach out to
recruiters and you mentioned like one
platform is LinkedIn and we could do
different things to differentiate
ourselves there so what are other ways
we could differentiate ourselves I'm
talking to recruiters on so having some
sort of a presence on social media we'll
all go back to LinkedIn can can help it
you are really active on Linkedin in
your part of different groups you
participate and we post things that are
relevant to you know your industry or
job search on it just helps to like
Bruce your name a little bit um also
coming in community of connections I
would caution you though to have a
quality of connection over quantity of
connection some people tend to think
that the number is all that matters but
I comes to LinkedIn and the more people
you have that's all that's that's the
biggest deal you can make it's not true
if you are connected with 500 people and
none of them have anything to do with
what what your industry is what types of
jobs are trying to get or the field
you're in it's not helping you at all um
her connections you have really should
be about type of role you're trying to
get it should be industry people so you
can bounce ideas off each other share
articles on connect so that that's
having building a connection only give
you a way to differentiate yourself
using other forms of social media
chemical oh I know might sound crazy but
using social media platforms such as
Facebook or Twitter in a professional
capacity can also be helpful I because
they're going to search you and I think
your Facebook box set or your Twitter
feed pops up no prob thing depending on
how in depth of a recruit
or hire a manager they are they might
check that out and if they see that
you're not not that you need to go and
make all of your all of your social
media is like super professional now
that's not the case but if you're
choosing to not make them professional
make them private because it's somebody
searching you and they find things you
don't want them to see it could be a
detriment to your job search but having
a professional professional linkedin or
having a facebook or twitter could help
as well with posting professional
articles kind of like you would on
linkedin same with twitter reposting
things following people in the industry
all of that helps helps build your brand
um one last thing that I think people
sometimes overlooked because it tends to
be very personal um is blogging talking
about your professional journal or
journey as kind of like an online
journal how you build products how you
saw questions how what X of challenges
you overcame and your search to become a
developer can just give another layer I
all of these things essentially our
supplement to the main form of job
searching which is an application or a
resume so none of these replace a resume
or an application but they just
implement them that are away for
recruiters and people possibly looking
at you to get a better sense of your
skills abilities and who you are alright
yeah that sounds really awesome so now
we know how to differentiate ourselves
so I'm at a nanodegree right now and
maybe I just graduated or I just really
wanna start looking for a job really um
what are something like the best
practices I could follow what I'm
starting a job search like how do I even
know what companies I want to start at
right yeah that's a oftentimes this is
this is the hardest place to start in
any job search regardless of what type
of God retrying gas regardless of the
industry you're trying to get into or
break into or gonna start in and
figuring about how to start your job
search team you really can be an
overwhelming place to start um and so
giving some thought to trying to answer
the following questions can be a helpful
way to pedal
um wait wait so the new questions our
location so are you happy with where
you're currently living are you looking
to relocate what does that geography
look like for you on industry so we're
going tech there's a lot of like sub
industries like health care or finance
or thinking or education um fitness
there's nutrition there's a ton pretty
much anything you could think of some
sort of sort of somewhere out there
doing it so getting getting some thought
to if you have a personal interest in
something already you want to take that
further into this next step of your
career really honing in on that can be
helpful as well giving some thought to
what type of company you want to work
for so sighs what their personal values
are what their how they treat their
employees um some of the perks and
benefits that come come attached to that
role um so thinking about those types of
questions and trying to come up with
some sort of an answer can give you a
place to start you don't whilst you want
to be careful not to limit yourself too
much to only having like two different
kind of companies available to you but
it's mostly just a place to start um
sending out mass mass applications to
companies that you're not passionate
about or you have no interest in what
their product is can show a little bit
sometimes to hiring managers felt
they'll take a look at your resume if
you like I don't understand at all how
this person fits into our jobs or what
we're working on so if there's something
specific you're really wanting to do or
bathroom you have that you're wanting to
continue but just now in a different
capacity capacity the web developer
applying for those and look into that
and use that to start your search all
right so what if a recruiter reaches out
to me with a job oh yeah so if the
recruiter reaches out to you with a job
role on I would ask some questions as to
what's expected of this job where's it
located just general questions that you
don't have and then just because it
recruiters reaching out to you doesn't
mean you have to go or do any
sing with it if it's not something
you're interested in um if you really
are strongly like nope this is not for
me I don't care this is nothing our work
and it's not a role I want located where
I want like you're more than welcome to
turn it down more will come if you're
being reached out by one recruiter that
means more access to you and working
find you I would however give some
thought to possibly considering it only
as a practice to go through the process
on interview practice especially its
attack technical interview is associated
with their internal process getting some
practice with this can be really
beneficial the last thing you want is to
have an interview with a company you're
stoked about if you really want to work
for and then you get to a terrible
interview and you don't even know what
to do you've never practice one before
you vomit so getting some practice in
your belt whether it's a textable
interview or just a behavioral interview
in a new process in general can be not
necessarily the most comfortable or fun
experience to go through so having some
of your belt before you find your dream
job can just be helpful um so I know
like a resume is really important but
after I apply like how really a whole
point is to resume really to like that
recruiter and the company yeah so resume
is hugely important I had somebody who
has a name with creating background if I
was to get a resume in for a role in
working on and the résumé either was
not professional wasn't formatted well I
super crazy Kramer errors or selling
errors they tend to not take it
seriously you might they put them at the
dump market along with that if you
better rhythm in and the content is good
and there's no some years but it has
nothing to do with the job you are
trying to fill you also won't be taken
seriously so being able to have a
professional resume that is curated for
the role you're looking for can be
really helpful so making a targeted
resume for the company for your specific
role you're looking for even going one
step
for a very making it company specific or
super role-specific so one example would
be saying you were you were you have
experience as a taxi driver and you are
applying an uber um you want to make
sure that you list back because you also
you have actual experience in the field
they are in um yes you might be a junior
web developer but you have in space as a
taxi driver which ties in to uber
platform in general on so you making it
super company in Super Bowl specific can
be helpful as well yeah so if I was
applying at facebook i probably wouldn't
put the same resume where I had that cab
driving space yeah yeah then if you're
going back in depth with your resume and
making it that targeted um you would
want to then make the prez may use
Facebook more about like something
specific to the role at Facebook and one
thing that can really help you is to
find the job description that the
company has posted and take some key
terms and he turns and some of the roles
and responsibilities and see how some of
your past experience relates to that or
yields to that and then list that top up
your experience that relates to what
they are looking for on it just it
catches the eye of the recruiters and it
really it really can go a long way to
showcase how you'd be perfect for it
instead of making the recruiter kind of
like second-guess how you'd be a good
fit for it you want it to be like
clearly from a question your resume like
this is why I'm a good this is what my
experiences this is how yields to the
role you're looking for you want that to
just come out of your resume without
having to explicitly say it yeah so what
if a candidate has some really
impressive maybe professional resume but
and I not even relates the industry or
on the job title there apply for when
you yeah so I if you're looking for your
you're trying to get your first job in
this new industry so if you're taking
your nanodegree you're trying to get
like say your background you came from a
business
list now you're trying to be a web
developer um and you you don't have a
lot of tangible like industry experience
to showcase I wouldn't still list you're
in a work history section still list
your professional experience because
oftentimes having professional
experience can also speak a lot about
who you are and who you are as employee
maybe just don't go into like really
in-depth examples of what your roles and
responsibilities where your past
companies just list that you for their
the years worked what your title was
maybe like one line about what your role
was with this case you'd want your
projects and your the your experience at
you vaseline your education to really be
the focal point of that resume on so
they're just you know different types of
resumes for different types of
experiences as you get more industry
experience you can start to take away
some of the less relatable professional
experience and have your industry
experience kind of speak for that so as
as you get more opportunities to
practice your skills more job
opportunities your your resume will kind
of take shape and will slowly start to
read more industry specific yes so are
there any like last-minute tips you want
to give to people that will be talking
to recruiters and are doing a job search
before we could go into the questions
that are since I've said it um yeah
mostly just put it to summarize and to
touch that one thing um really you want
to diversify yourself don't put all your
eggs in one basket and you you owe it to
yourself to not settle for just one or
two help you if you work with recruiters
work with multiple on find yourself jobs
along with them on be careful when with
recruiters in just in general they don't
don't sell yourself short and don't
believe don't bind everything they say
they are they're trying to find the best
candidate for their position obviously
you're going to think you are the best
candidate they the company might not
agree so don't
necessarily like get yourself settled or
spent on a roll that a recruiter is
helping you with you should still do
your own search you are your own best
advocate I think I said that earlier on
and then this in addition to not keeping
or not putting all your eggs in one
basket like multiple search avenues and
search paths can just help you stay
fresh and keep your skills up on while
you're looking for a job don't let your
skills go stagnant the worst thing you
can do is to focus all your attention on
your job search should pay any attention
to keeping your projects up-to-date keep
learning keep practicing that back speak
only as you're playing two roles keep
yourself organized so have some sort of
a spreadsheet as to where you've applied
what the progress is when you should
check back in what what applications you
set out where where you resume that even
if you end up doing a targeted resume on
having like a folder designated
specifically to resume is entitled both
resumes with the company things that way
you know that that's specifically that
one so you don't accidentally send out
your what you thought was your normal
resume to a company and it has a bunch
of company information in it so that can
just be just general best practices and
then also be persistent I know job
search in general can just be kind of it
can be overwhelming to get started with
and then it can be very discouraging if
you get some negative feedback in the
beginning so don't don't get too caught
up in that just let yourself just keep
people flying the the more you apply the
more experiences you get the more
opportunities you get to practice
interviewing and coding challenges and
so just the more opportunities you put
yourself out there and the better chance
do you have overall so be persistent
yeah um so thanks a lot for that rachel
is really informative really great um so
next thing we're going to go to is um
for those of you that I've taking the
surveyed before we gave this webcast we
had a section where you can put any
questions that you would like answered
in the webcast um so I'm just going to
we're going to get to the ones that we
felt like we related with the most and
then if we
time we might be able to cut some more
so if your question doesn't get answered
we're sorry but this all you got alright
so first question we have here is how
can I improve my skills to crack the
coding interview any resources so I was
actually in a really similar situation i
just recently graduated from nanodegree
and i was like i need to learn data
structures and algorithms and be able to
perform an accounting interview in a
technical interview and do these things
and I was also like wondering where can
I start on the first advice I would give
is definitely don't give up and like
know that you can do it because when you
first start out it might be like wow I
wish I had a computer science degree or
I could have learned all of this but the
thing is you can teach the stuff to
yourself you got so far with Udacity
nanodegree so it certainly is possible
um so you know just just start googling
data structures on check to check out
books like cracking the coding interview
um what I would personally recommend is
go to hacker encom and just start going
through those problems and then if you
need to learn a data structure to solve
a problem go and Google that data
structure google that algorithm so you
know how to solve the problem alright
and this gives you practice in that sort
of situation and then when you sort of
feel like you understand data structures
and you're ready to start sort of start
practicing interviews before you
actually enter interview situation
there's a great website out there it's
called francom pyare MP com that's the
name of sight and what that allows you
to do it actually allows you to take
turns interviewing a person and then
that person would interview you with
coding and algorithm questions right so
this is this is pretty I as close to
real life as you're gonna get right
because you have your webcam in front of
you and you're speaking in front of this
person and there's an online code or pad
and so you're really walking through
polym as you would in an interview have
a person in front of you to tell you how
you can get better and how you can get
worse and also putting that choose to
the interviewer right so you can see
things that maybe you wouldn't have
noticed while you were doing it but you
could see somebody else do it um so that
would be my answer to that and yeah just
don't give up um so the next question we
have is a recruiter
look at many profiles people to identify
potential candidate for specific
positions on this kind of long question
very often these positions belong to
specific Department our team for
instance our database management systems
and it is possible that there are other
departments and teams in that company
that are more relevant to you for
instance data analytics mining or some
other data engineering so my question is
how do you get the recruiter to review
your profile and set up a call with
someone from other departments but might
be looking for a candidate with the
profile similar to mine and how do you
stand out from others so my there's two
paths I guess that this would take first
is it it depends on if the recruiter is
an external recruiter working with a
third party company or is from their
train company or isn't an internal
recruiter on easily if you are applying
if you find this position that you're
applying to it directly if that's a
scenario to which got you to this
application and that you see that there
are multiple roles across different
teams you'd be a good fit for apply to
all of them um that's always a good idea
if you see multiple roles don't
pigeonhole yourself just like don't put
your eggs in may of my baskets
essentially um and then because what
will happen is if there are different
recruiter like our hiring managers that
are associated to each role they will
talk amongst themselves because they all
work together um they will end up
figuring out that they are all talking
to the same person or interested in the
same person and then work together to
figure out which department you would
actually be as if it for that happens a
lot you I I don't think you'd be
surprised or mean it might be surprising
it's how often that actually happens but
never living yourself you're interested
in multiple different teams apply to all
of them um now if you're getting
contacted directly from a hiring manager
from an external party or even an
internal party and you have taken the
kind to get to know this company and you
recognize that there's a lot of roles
they have open that you
silly the image before you worried about
not getting in touch with the right
person for those just asked if it's an
actual recruiter they might also be
working on that role or they might know
somebody who is or they might not have
been aware that position is open and
just ask and just tell them hey I
noticed when after you told me about
this role I looked up the company it
looks at their jobs I noticed they also
have these positions posted based on my
experience I think I give it for them to
who do I talk to can you make that
introduction and just ask they're not
going to be they're not going to be
offended if you ask for that they will
get the referral bonus regardless of
which job you get put into if they have
it the company hires you for that goes
for external or internal recruiters no
it doesn't really matter as long as the
company makes a higher that's that's
their biggest concern I had awesome
thanks Rachel um so this was a question
that's particularly curious um so how do
you sponsor the question how much money
do you earn the student said that they
usually reply with my talk to Sally or
say something like oh we're at the fair
market value so what is the best way to
respond to that question from our
Kreeger again this is not as simple as I
think I
good question nobody likes talking about
money um in general and so it's
uncomfortable anyway so there are two
different scenarios I am going to come
talk through first is the scenario where
you have no work experience you are
entered this this would potentially be
your first job in this new industry you
just got your NATO degree your apply
they potentially make you an offer and
they're asking about what your current
salary is and you don't know how to
answer that because you don't you've
never had a salary as a web developer
before one thing you should do is prior
to starting the entry process or as
you're engaged with it as you have an
interview with a company um look look up
what like just the medium or market
range salary is for people in your
similar position and just see without
there depending on what your where
you're located it might differ greatly
so take that in consideration there are
using a site like glass door can
actually give you some specific
information on what that specific
companies salary ranges so you can kind
of get because even within the same
market area different companies are
going to pay different amounts depending
on whether they're they're established
company they have a bigger budget or
startup they who might have a smaller
budget so getting specific information
on what the company's salary ranges can
hop to and then um in addition to that
if you're making a career change in you
wear a senior little person prior or
your fresh college grad there might be
some differences in terms of what this
new salary is going to be so if you are
a senior little person making a
transition into a starting developer
role you might have to just accept the
fact that you might have to take a bit
of a pay cut just to get started there
is a lot of new for Brooks with intact
and so you could easily within a year to
six months make um make up to what you
were making prior but you might have to
bite the bullet and take a pay cut in
the beginning so really what you want to
do is figure out how low you can go
what your price range is for making what
you're what you what you can make it
look comfortably for your app um that
might take some budgeting that might
take some really like deep deep diving
into what you spend your money on and
how do you spend your money but really
take into consideration like what it
would be to live comfortably and then
ask for that or a little bit more but
give you some room negotiation with what
you want to know is where the lowest you
can possibly go because if they make you
an offer you negotiate you know how low
can possibly go um give yourself up
brighten up so you're not living on the
streets you never want to have to do
that just to take on a job that's like
my worst case scenario but just
understand that within different market
ranges within different companies and
different jobs even there might be
differences in salary and just so do do
your research going into it and then my
next set of advice is somewhat similar
but if if you already have industry
experience so say you have experience as
a you took pretty much in a degree as
just a way to and a bolster your skills
over you have had a job and I are
getting your second job and they ask how
much you're making always ask for more
because I gives you room to negotiate
and because sometimes depending on the
company they'll offer you what you say
you're making now and so if you give it
hold that more they you have a buffer
and essentially anymore and you comin
Burton League otten erase with this new
position so salary negotiation in and of
itself can be very tricky enough and
then uncomfortable thing to do on the
career resources center that Udacity has
created actually has a lot of resources
on how to go through this and different
scenarios how to make the most of it and
how to really make sure you're not
understanding yourself for or you're not
preventing yourself and getting drop
opportunities because you've asked for
too much so it kind of walked through
that so I would definitely recommend
checking that out if you have
or specific questions regarding how to
handle with because it can be tricky
yeah the Career Resource Center is
really great I personally used it a lot
when I was looking for a job in
technology so it's a really awesome
thing on even that goes back to my
question on how to crack the coding
interview there are a lot of resources
there that will help you with that um
but back to this question um so
typically a recruiter my asskiss like
during the phone screening right um so
maybe like would you recommend to a
candidate that they could revisit this
topic after they get an offer yeah on
that so if you're talking to a recruiter
they will probably especially if it's a
pretty company they will probably ask
you early on what your salary ranges
just so that way they have an idea of
how where what kinds of roles for
venting for on because they know that if
they put you for a role and they know
that the salary is way too over what
your ranges or we played it helps them
kind of gear their search so they will
probably ask early on um you are more
than welcome to revisit as well as long
as you haven't accepted an offer you can
revisit a salary some there are
oftentimes things that come up that can
change a salary range and if there is
additional resources to seed it or maybe
they may be this company can give you a
certain like a salary amount but can't
provide any other benefits you have to
take that in consideration that's
oftentimes things you won't know until
later on on so just yeah as long as you
haven't verbally or on paper accepted an
offer you can always revisit and it
there are going to be situations where
maybe you have accepted an offer and you
something unexpected happened and you do
need to revisit it you can just be very
careful about how you tried with that
because that can leave a bad taste and
company smell but those are extenuating
circumstances and those are one in a
million so that we don't really need to
get into too much detail with that but
yeah just just be open and honest I
found just from
so experience like the more honest you
can be about what your needs are the
better so if a relocation is needed the
upfront and honest about what it would
take you what it would take for you to
move um if you need financial support
and say that we open and honest and ask
questions about what the company is able
to do for you as an employee because
that can sometimes impact salary as well
so do they have a really really good
benefit package or they have all these
other perks like a free gym membership
they have a cell phone reimbursement or
they order luncheon every day or they
have free childcare on-site like all of
those things can change the way you
might think about a salary that might
have been less than ideal there been
many times where I've I've worked with
somebody and the perks associated with
kroll has actually outweighed the the
left that I yield salary they were
making because they were actually going
to be saving all this extra money on
transportation expenses or you know they
got to work from homes it and has a
worry about coming to office there there
are other perks and day-to-day benefits
that can outweigh or can help impact
salary decisions would ask about those
as well all right yeah I'm so thanks for
making that what could seem like a
difficult question a lot easier for us
so next question we have here is as soon
wants to know how can they market
themselves with no related work just
experienced any kind of professional
before yeah so we kind of went over this
with the resume aspect but the best
thing you can do is just to showcase the
skills and abilities that you do have so
you actually have all of these skills
that you might not realize this
experience some personal projects count
does work experience I used when you're
building a resume or when you're
building a portfolio or you're building
your Linkedin really talk up the
experience you do have and let the
experience you don't have kind of like
fall to the back you never want it to be
obvious that you know you don't have a
lot of experience you want to talk up at
projects you have worked on you want to
talk up the like a great way to do so
and to showcase that is to build a
tigard build a personal portfolio that
is essentially a website you are
creating for yourself you get to design
it you get to be the mastermind behind
it and it gets to allow the people who
are looking at it snippets of who you
are as a developer what your abilities
are there have been times where these
types of sites have turned into
employment opportunities for like a
concert fool because somebody's are
cycling I want you guys I want me off to
you like and then you can look that on
your resume or list like links to that
as an example of your work and so the
more experience you can get even if it's
out of a professional setting and it's
just a fun project you're working on or
something you're developing on your own
or an app you put out or projects you're
working on with friends hackathons you
can attend and participate in on github
you can do like at any time you can do
that that is building up your
professional experience so I know that
how marketing yourself with what seems
to be no experience can be a very
daunting thing to do but if you think
about it you actually probably
especially you have graduated from
Udacity you do have projects show for it
and you have work that you can showcase
um it just just yeah okay yeah and like
another thing you could even do is
what's your desk if you graduated from
your netid you could even apply to be a
code review that's another excellent way
to gain related work experience um so
the next question we have is how to six
my ideal job and not to be led by
recruiters and still work smoothly with
them yeah so just tips for working with
recruiters just because they they
contact you about job doesn't mean you
have to do anything with it doesn't mean
you have to consent to it doesn't mean
you have to let them put you forward it
at all if you like have a very clear
vision as to what you what job do you
want and where do you want to go with
your career and the job that this
recruiter was talking about doesn't fit
that path then you can just say I'm not
interested at this time you don't have
to connect to them you don't have to
work with them and often times though if
you are
working with a recruiter especially in
third party setting they will take the
time to get to know what your
motivations are and what what interests
you what types of projects you want to
work on types of companies you want to
work for if they're a good recruiter
anyway they will definitely take that
into consideration because that just
helps them in their search so you don't
if you're not interested in for whatever
reason you don't have to go with it like
I mentioned earlier if you are kind of
new to the interviewing scene I would
possibly suggest doing it anyway because
did you experience on how to interview
um and that can be invaluable in and of
itself just the interview resources that
for you talked about a great and will
definitely help you but nothing really
beats face to face in a high-pressure
situation when you're interviewing for
an actual job and a jobs on the line
even if a job you don't want like you
still get the like the pressure of it
and so I think nothing can replace that
type of feeling so practicing and using
using these jobs that you have no
interest in I just simply practice can
just maybe help you later down the road
yeah and even if you get the job and
also on the table Everett yeah you don't
have to take it because you had an offer
doesn't mean you have to take the job um
if you get two offers that can help with
you know salary negotiation you can use
one to leverage together on so yeah just
it never hurts to say no I I'm sorry
shal that looks like all the questions
that we planned on that story that got
sent in do you think we have on any time
for any more here um okay yeah so we
have a few here um what we originally
planned to do was actually answer some
of your questions live but it looks like
there's an issue with that right now but
for the next career broadcast we promise
to have that working oh and also just to
know if you guys have any question that
about content that we brought up there
we talked about and because we can't
answer them now I've feel free to email
me or ratio and we can figure out who
would be the best person to answer the
question yeah I'll depending on what the
question is so at the end actually I
guess we can give our
well if you just email Udacity dash
support yeah don't get sensitive like
the best person yeah so and just just
like mention webcast fall know so that
way they know exactly the rest of the
way they could go to anybody yeah so uh
which one of these questions let's get
social um okay so this is one that I
personally had to deal with so how did
answer the question why do change change
jobs so often once in a year so I myself
over the last two years have changed
jobs maybe four times um not because
just because opportunities present
themselves and I took it on and there
it's not a negative to change jobs
especially in this ever-changing startup
scene in fact I what you're trying it
into tons of jobs will turn will like
one will become another you'll gold meet
something here that will offer you this
as long as the jobs you are jumping to
fit to your career path that's all that
really matters um and if oftentimes
people who who take on contract work
deal with this as well because it
appears on a resume that they had like
six jobs in the last year because each
one have been like short-term contracts
and if you just say up Fred that that's
that's the situation um that's totally
fine even in my face where I've just
taken on new opportunities meet none of
them have been like for very long for
one reason or another you can just be
honest and say that and just explain you
know why what how you got started what
your what the transition was what led
you on to the next job and you can just
say like the difference is though if you
are getting fired from all these jobs
and that's why there's so much turnover
you might want to rethink what you're
doing in these jobs to get you fired /
typically that's not the case
differently is because an opportunity
lens themselves or or you're moving or
whatever the situation
is just be honest about it recruiters
are smart we tend to have a very good
read on people and so especially if
you've been doing this for long enough
you can tell when people aren't being
truthful and something shady is going on
so it's always better to be honest and
just explain what happened what the
situation was and why you made a change
and you know it just that's usually my
best my best advice for that yeah thanks
for the Rachel Elam is there anything
else that you see um okay so how do I
get how do I get employers to get past
the node agree on this person has github
and and projects so i think this county
goes back to what I mentioned earlier in
terms of how to market yourself with no
experience so just don't it don't focus
yourself on the fact that you don't have
a CS degree you have Udacity Hannah
degree which in and of itself is
starting to gain more traction and
starting to just like other boot camp an
emergent programs kind of take the place
of cs degrees and that that shouldn't be
if you feel like that's holding you back
I think that that's a new thing not
necessarily recruiter thing on just
because a job post or a good job
requirement list that you see lists
specific types of actually eager
education experience or um like how many
years worked in a situation that's
oftentimes a wish list but it's often
times not to the company is actually
hiring so don't ever feel if you can't
apply to a position just because you
don't hit every notch on the list you
should still apply um they're oftentimes
it's a big discrepancy between the job
posts and she's actually getting hired
for one reason or another on companies
will oftentimes totally be really tired
capable people don't regardless of what
their background is and within within
tech itself recently
with smarter or smaller medium-sized
companies there's a recognition that a
CS degree or a college degree doesn't
mean anything there's a difference in
what you're learning in a CS setting
versus what you're learning in a
nanodegree setting in terms of actual
tangible hands-on work experience on
projects so as long as you showcase the
experience you do have and don't like
showcase the experience you don't have
uh you'll you'll be okay yeah like dumb
for a lot of my nano degrees there
talking subjects that some universities
don't even offer classes and right so
you might be even more qualified than
somebody who has a CS degree to be an
Android developer because you took our
net right so make sure to mention that
and really showcase your projects oh so
rachel is there anything else ah see
what's the moment mostly of the
questions that have been submitted to be
covered in some capacity so I don't feel
like we need to keep retouching on it um
okay when I one there's one more i will
touch on is how to bypass recruiters and
go directly to the company which has the
opening so in all honesty your end gonna
end up working with recruiter because
the person handling it even if you go
directly to accompany the person
receiving your application is going to
be your recruiter just an internal
recruiter so you're still going to ask
deal with them in some way it so you
might just need to kind of get over that
a little bit they're not as scary as
they have to me and just just yeah there
might be in some situations if you're
working with a super small on a super
small company that there's not going to
be affair because they don't have an HR
set up so you might then and those cases
talk to somebody who's more engaged with
the actual engineering or CTO CEO type
person that's pretty rare yeah but by
all means if you know somebody in a
company and you could get an internal
referral definitely do that right but
you probably will get sent to a
recruiter eventually um so yeah that was
really great it was really great having
you here today Rachel um I don't know
about you but I sure learned a lot today
a lot of great things um so yeah
basically get their job of course uh
like I said if you have any questions
feel free to reach out and let us know
on well we'll probably probably next
week send out a list or a survey a
simple questionnaire to all the people
who attended or said they were going to
attend just with follow-up information
about how you think it went what you
would have liked to see maybe possible
future topics so keep that in mind as
you're reviewing this as you're thinking
back on on today and what was talked
about and what you would like to see for
next time yeah it would be really
awesome to get you guys to back all
right that's it thanks guys thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
