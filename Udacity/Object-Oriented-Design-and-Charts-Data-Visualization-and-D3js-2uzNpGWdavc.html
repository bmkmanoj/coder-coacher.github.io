object-oriented programming or its
counterpart the functional programming
paradigm this may seem weird to you we
called a few methods on an object the
methods return some values but now when
you want to actually draw a chart we
call the draw method on our original my
chart variable what's happening behind
the scenes that the dimple library
actually implements an object-oriented
interface for its objects in which the
method calls on the my chart object
mutate the internal state of the object
what does this mean will only call the
series and add access functions they
actually add the axis and series objects
into the chart that they're called on so
now when we call draw on my chart my
charts been mutated by the add series
and add access calls such that they have
all the data and specification they need
for the draw function to operate the fun
thing about working in the debugger with
chrome is that as soon as we call the
draw function the chart will immediately
be drawn into the web page keep an eye
on the web page in the background here
and even though we're paused in the
debugger all the code we execute here
has access to the web page itself
calling the draw method we can see that
a bar chart spontaneously appeared in
our web page window one last thing to
note before we move on to better and
different charts is that the return
object from the draw function is the
chart object that we called it on if we
inspect draw chart which we stored the
return value of my chart draw into and
we can see here that it's dimple dot
chart and has all the same properties as
our original chart and again you can
actually check whether it is equivalent
to our initial chart by using the triple
equals operator in JavaScript and
comparing it to my chart and we can see
here that it is indeed the original
chart this style of returning the object
that you call the method on is exactly
how D 3 works and
you to chain methods without having to
go through an intermediate
representation or variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
