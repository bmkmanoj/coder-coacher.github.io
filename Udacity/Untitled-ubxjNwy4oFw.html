our main activity we'll get back to that
in a little while but first let's create
our intent service we're going to call
it detected activities intent service
I'll do this by creating a new Java
class and calling it as I said detected
activities intent service so here you
can see my new class has been created
for me well there's a few things I'm
going to need to set this up first of
all there should be a tag that we're
going to use for logging events and a
constructor for the class here's the tag
i'm setting up i'm just calling it
detection is where is stands for intent
service and here's the constructor and
all i'm just going to do with the
constructor is super the tag there's one
more thing that I need to do not is
because this is an intense service I
have to get it to extend the intent
service class and we do that right here
because I've pasted intent service in an
android studio recognize that I haven't
imported that yet it's asking me if I
want to import it and yes of course I do
you may notice that I have a red
underline here and that's because I
haven't implemented the on handle intent
yet and if you remember earlier we
mentioned that you have to implement
that and you pass the desired intent to
that so we will do that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
