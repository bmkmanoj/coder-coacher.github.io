we select training examples when when a
learner is needing to learn so let's at
least articulate some various ways that
training examples could be selected and
then for each one we might end up with a
different answer as to how much training
date is going to be needed if the
training examples are selected in that
particular way so so what do you think
Charles are there any ways you can think
of for selecting training examples well
so I so here's how I think about it so
you keep using the word learner and when
there's a learner there's often a
teacher so I'm trying to think about
this in the different ways that learners
and teachers can interact so I'm gonna
try to think about my experience as a
professor so there are a couple here's
one one is sometimes the learner asks
questions of the teacher I see so in
this case the learner would be selecting
the training examples the learner would
say I you know here's here's an input X
would you please tell me C of X right
that's exactly what I'm thinking
right right then there's another case so
the learner ask questions of the teacher
but sometimes the teacher just goes
ahead and gives XCX pairs and let's say
it's it actually is trying to help the
learner sure so it's a friendly teacher
okay I've had some of those good all
right so this could be the learner
asking to try to get data it could be
the teacher asking to try to lead the
learner to something good and anything
else well so I like this this way of
thinking about it because it sort of
makes sense in my world as a professor
but it doesn't actually sound like
either of these things is what we've
been looking at so far what I think
we've been looking at so far is that
somehow the X's and the C X is the
training examples just come out of
nowhere they come from some underlying
distribution it's just nature it's just
coming at us from some process that we
don't know what that process is yeah I
like that so in some sense there's three
individuals that could be asking for
examples there's the teacher there's the
learner and there's like the world
around them and and the things could
come from any of those I guess another
possibility would be that questions are
asked specifically in an evil way all
right so all of these different kinds of
distributions or ways of selecting
training examples they're actually going
to come into play and
stuff that we're talking about let's
let's use the first couple to get a
sense of why these things might be
different from each other so let's go
back to this notion of twenty questions
