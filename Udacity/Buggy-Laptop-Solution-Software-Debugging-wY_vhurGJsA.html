hint right within this story battery is
the correct answer after three hours my
battery had run out which means that
until then I had worked on battery power
in order to recharge my battery are
reconnected to AC power and it turned
out that it was this difference that
caused the program to fail when my
laptop ran on a AC power which was
precisely the configuration for which
everything was installed the program
worked just fine if it ran on a battery
however the program failed it turned out
that my laptop ran slower when running
on batteries this saved energy but also
introduced interesting timeout errors so
I made a mental note to fix these as
soon as we get home and of course I gave
the demo on AC power to make sure that
all our tests were not in vain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
