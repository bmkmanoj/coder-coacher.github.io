for this is because each ciphertext is
the result of exhorting a message with
the key so C is equal to M XOR K C prime
is equal to M prime XOR K
note that the K is the same in both
cases so if we XOR C and C Prime
that's going to be M XOR K XOR M Prime
XOR K and the really useful thing that
happens if you're trying to break this
cipher is these two K's will cancel out
so that's why you end up with M XOR M
Prime so that doesn't tell right away
what the message is if the messages were
exactly the same M XOR M prime would
just be 0 and this wouldn't tell us
anything the ciphertext ex-ored will be
0 but they weren't exactly the same so
when the Allies XOR these ciphertext
they didn't get all zeros and the reason
for that was because of the
abbreviations that were used in the
transmission an example would be if the
original message has truck number
meaning serial number well maybe in the
retransmission it became an abbreviation
truck number and that would mean well
the places where the letters start to be
different we start to see differences
between the ciphertext in the ciphertext
Prime and unlike the key which was
pretty close to random there were a lot
of things you could guess about the
messages the Allies had a pretty good
guess that the message was in German so
the Allies could start trying let's say
the guess the message will guess at M
star then we could try seeing what we
get when we do M star ex-ored with the C
XOR with the C Prime so we can make some
guess for the message try exhorting it
with the intercepted cipher text that
should give us back the other message
and we'll look if that looks like a
possible message this is definitely a
painstaking process but something that
can be done once you get to 2 messages
by this guessing process then it's easy
to find the key once you have the two
messages through this guessing you had
ciphertex intercepted now you know the
key so learning the messages might be
useful by the time you've done all this
work maybe it's too late for the message
to be useful but learning the key could
be really useful so this was done by
Colonel John Tillman who took these two
intercepts and determined the key that
produced them and they had enough
content here that there were 4,000
letters in the intercepts so they had a
4,000 long key and this key was given to
Bill type this was his first assignment
at Bletchley Park was to try to make
sense of this key and after about six
months of work he was able to determine
the Machine structure that produced that
key and this is what it is you have five
lines going in this is the five bits in
the Bedok code for encoding each
character and the rest of the machine is
to produce the key bits and there's an
XOR with each of these wheels so these
wheels will rotate with each character
and then there's another set of wheels
that sometimes rotate and sometimes
don't and we have these two M wheels
based on the result of X or Y M wheels
either all of the s wheels rotate one
position for that character or none of
them do and this was really the biggest
weakness in Lorenz cipher was that the s
wheels all moved at once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
