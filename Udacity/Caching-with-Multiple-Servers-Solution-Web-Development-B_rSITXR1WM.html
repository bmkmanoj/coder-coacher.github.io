a trick question it's actually not a
trick question multiple app servers
means multiple caches and so we have to
keep them and sync yes that is one
source of problems we are going to face
you know we have multiple app servers
let's draw a picture and we've got our
database and say both of these guys have
their little cache here
you know let's say both these caches are
both these caches are warm they've got
their stuff let's say a database you
know a post comes in here that that
results in a database right which
results in a and a refreshing of the
cache now we've got one app server with
an up-to-date cache in another app
server with an out-of-date cache and so
if a read comes into here we're gonna
get stale cache and that's no good so we
got to figure out way to keeping these
caches in sync each app server may have
to hit the database to update its cache
you know this is a problem let's say a
situation isn't neither both of these
caches are cold they're empty and to
read requests come in or many read
requests come in this is similar to the
cache stampede problem where each of
these app servers is going to want to
update his cache which means it's gonna
have to hit the database so that's
problematic as well now of course we can
alleviate you know some of these
problems by updating the cache on writes
but we'd still have to find a way of you
know keeping these guys in sync with one
another which is a little tedious and
the final answer will be caching data
redundantly I'm not accepting that one
in this quiz as a bad thing because very
often you do cache data redundantly
that's kind of what a cache is right
you're storing data redundantly and i'm
actually torn on whether this should be
considered a downside or a plus side are
kind of neutral but for our purposes we
want to focus on these problems which is
keeping these caches in sync and
limiting the number of database requests
we do now the solution we're gonna
approach here is gonna change this
architecture a little bit instead of
each app server having its own cache
we're gonna move caching into its own
process and so now both these app
servers will use a shared cache and so
this cache actually behaves very similar
to the database except the queries are
much simpler they're just key value
pairs and it's probably only in memory
and there's technology designed
specifically to solve this problem which
is to be fast and used as a cache which
is different from a database which is
designed to you know run complex queries
on huge amounts of data this piece of
technology
it's called memcached and we're going to
be spending basically the rest of this
you're learning how to use memcached</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
