square team as an example and see how
they came up with their value
proposition now what's interesting is if
you remember value proposition describes
not only the features but also the pains
and gains that they see that if they'd
actually create for the customer and
that the goal is to figure out what the
MVP is and if we see that Jersey square
team they actually did a pretty good job
talking about pains and gains a cheaper
way to we're officially licensed sports
jerseys to a game to eliminate the risk
of owning a player's Jersey who's going
to be traded or to provide an
alternative to purchasing counterfeit
jerseys pretty good for pains and canes
but what they forgot to describe is what
are the features and just so we could
remember the features for jersey squares
they were going to provide a single
place where you could rent sports
jerseys so you wouldn't have to own them
and maintain them to visit your favorite
team on what they also missed is what
was the MVP or Minimum Viable Product of
what they were going to build and in
their case it was going to be a website
with rental and the stock of jerseys of
the most popular teams at first in the
New York area and then nationally in the
United States and then ultimately
internationally so those were kind of
missing but again starting with pains
and gains was pretty good for their
value proposition notice by the way
while they were working on value
proposition they also had some
hypotheses about the customer segments
and this is a key ideas value
proposition and customer segments are
the first two things you tend to work on
with the business model canvas because
these two have a special name called
product market fit and prada market fit
just simply says what is the match
between
what you're building and what customers
need and want and who are those
customers so while the goal and value
prop is to figure out the MVP as we'll
see later the goal in customer segments
is to figure out who and what the
archetype of a customer is so again you
could start either with customer
segments or you can start with a product
and value prop itself it really doesn't
matter but most teams if they're
technology driven tend to start on value
prop and most teams if they happen to be
market ears or business people
happen to start with the customer
segments there's no right place but it's
the interaction between these two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
