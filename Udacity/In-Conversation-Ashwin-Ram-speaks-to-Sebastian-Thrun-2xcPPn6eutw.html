interviewing dr. Ashe Monroe senior
manager of AI science at Amazon Alexa
and dr. Sebastian Thrun president and
co-founder of Udacity can you tell us a
little bit about yourselves and how you
got into AI and some of the projects you
worked on in the past so my first
introduction to AI was Doug Hofstadter's
book early girl Aschenbach he came to
the u.s. to study engineering in grad
school and rapidly discovered that AI
was my passion also for my wife here
which is nice interesting experience I
was did a PhD in the I at a liberal arts
school at Yale and so I was studying
science and technology but also being
exposed to the human side of technology
looking at philosophy psychology
designed the human experience and that
covered the way I look at the I mean my
story is somewhat similar I was in
college and I wanted to understand
people and I started philosophy
medicines psychology liberal biology and
the suddens computer science major and
in English science I found AI to be an
interesting study of the human
intelligence and and I got really
frustrated with philosophy because
people make these outrageous claims and
they can't back it up they can't say
here's a system and the system that's
exactly the following thing guys in the
eye you couldn't make an outrageous
claim at the time it was very small but
at least you've a bit of an entire
system so I got really intrigued by
building robots that do something that I
can understand and what are some of your
past projects that you're most proud of
nai well I've worked on south driving
cars I've build a huge number of
different robots I build robots it would
explore abandoned mines and build my
maps I what was they went to Smithsonian
Museum and gave tours to tourists robots
in the medical sector or that helped
elderly age and be able to be more
mobile and so on and these are all AI
projects all the way to more like in
intellectual perception projects and
then a product recently on finding skin
cancer where we could show that
adequately trained AI is better
finding skin cancer than the best human
doctors how about you dr. ROM I think my
most favorite project is the first one I
did and it's also the last one I'm doing
now I've worked on a range of things
have worked on robotics I worked on
computer games AI for games they've
worked on machine Diagnostics but I
started my life in language
understanding and in looking at how AI
might understand human language and
learn from human language several years
later full circle now at Alexa I'm
working in the same problem again the
progress has been amazing the progress
has been amazing and there's still a lot
of hard problems to solve
I like servo time is it the time is 2 or
7 p.m. that's so cool
so you're currently working on Alexa and
voice user interfaces how are these two
different and also how do you display to
the lay audience the difference between
conversational AI and voice cognition
the voice user interface part of Alexa
or any other system is the speech
recognition part right we have to
understand what words you just said from
the sound waves have to turn turn those
into text and then we have to serve
understand what you're asking in this
case Sebastian was asking about the time
and so we have to then respond back with
the time that gives Sebastian a voice
interface to a well known application in
this case the time application right
when you get into conversational a I now
he's talking about truly understanding
what language means why the person is
asking me this and what response they
might want to apply ask Alexa to wake me
up in the morning what I'm really asking
is setting along in the morning I didn't
say that people don't say what they mean
they expected and for that so you can
ask Alexa something quite complicated
like Alexa who was the president when
Obama was a teenager Richard Nixon
Ronald Reagan Jimmy Carter and Gerald
Ford were the US presidents when Barack
Obama was a teenager there's a lot of
inference going on here firstly what
kind of president not a company
president like Sebastian the country's
president we know that because you're
talking about Obama which Obama we have
shared knowledge of the world around us
and we know exactly who Obama refers to
we also now
can't look up a webpage to find the
answer to this question doesn't exist we
have to go back and do some inference
there's many steps involved in figuring
out what time period are we talking
about finding the individual piece of
information and collecting it together
on the fly
all of these are hard problems and it
all has to happen in about a second what
are the implications of voice user
interfaces for interfaces in the future
and for human-computer interaction I
would say and we trained ourselves to
use our fingers and in the beginning it
was a very cryptic language to talk to a
computer in the early days you had to do
PAP and LS and crazy commands and then
we got to a point where we can move
stuff at the house mouse around and
moved to trade our hand to to move left
and right and up and down or the thing
on the trackpad
and now it's coming full circle now we
can just talk to our house the same way
we talk to our family there's no
instruction and so you can unpack and
exit as an example when put on your desk
and the only thing you have to learn is
the name so he's called Alexa and then
you can talk to her natural language and
I think that's a it's a great great
ability to take this compute idea and
make it so pervasive in our lives
without any training whatsoever
they're just ever in the world can
benefit from it yeah very similar story
you know for years we've been typing to
our computers and other devices you know
we type on microwave control panels and
TV remotes and all kinds of things and
for the last few years 10 or so years
we've had touchscreens we've been able
to touch and swipe and so forth but
that's not how we communicate when we
want to talk we're not typing into each
other we're not touching and swiping
we're just talking you're talking back
right why can't our devices do that not
just computers all devices why can I
talk to my thermostat in my microwave
and my car and and every other piece of
technology imagine the world of
technology being accessible to everyone
not just to the techno-savvy I think
that's the future of AI you just been in
the hotel and Alexa was part of the
hotel when we talked about this before
this recording and I could go in and
open the curtains using voice so do you
think we're upon the end of keyboards as
we know it would you say that what's
happening soon
I think that's a sweet spot for every
modality they never go entirely away if
you look at the ability to the number of
word counts per minute and so on
keywords will have the sweet spot but
I feel bothered by the fact that I have
to move my fingers to talk to a computer
honestly I'd rather talk the way we
talked about now and I think this is the
first time it's becoming reality as if
I'm such a big fan of Alexa and I really
am NOT just because it's sitting here
and working with us I'm a big fan of
Alexa I have many of them at home
because it is for me a complete new era
of computing yes so you know that again
there are sweet spots so that you know
we still need to type at things we still
need a mouse and keyboard if I'm making
a PowerPoint presentation or writing a
Word document I'm not gonna speak it out
and I certainly can't draw using my
voice but that's a very niche use case I
think for an 80 90 95 percent of what we
do in our daily lives boy should be just
fine
that's amazing we actually do some
speech to text dictation when teaching
it's a tool for rapid prototyping
sometimes at Udacity when we're
scripting out our courses or content so
there's also that use case too so you're
solving a major challenge with
conversational AI and what are the
product challenges and the technical
challenges that you're encountering
along the way so there are several
science challenges and of course
engineering challenges as well on the
science side I mentioned some of them
earlier understanding meaning
understanding the speaker's intent in
talking about something another tough
one is in a conversation where you have
multiple turns in a dialogue you have to
track context across across dialogue a
lot of our conversational agents
nowadays are very good at transactional
interaction sort of one step they play
music tell me the time but in order to
carry on a multi-step conversation we
have to track the context of the of the
dialogue along as we go that's another
really hard problem personalization is a
hard problem personalizing their
dialogues to every individual on the
technical side there are a lot of
challenges in training some of the
machine learning systems that I used to
do this requires a lot of data requires
a lot of compute power and a lot of time
so we have our highly paralyzed training
systems that are used to train models
these models have to run in real time
that's a hard problem as well and
they're typically too large to put on a
device so you also need connectivity to
the to the cloud at all times with fast
enough response rate and latency low
enough latency dr3 and you have any
questions
well I would say as much as a fan of of
Amazon I quote it's still in the infancy
right so so this box at some point
should be smarter than the smartest and
of a professor in fact my silver PhD
students should say I'd rather study
with Alexa in a study with Sebastian if
you look at the spectrum I mean we're
now at a point we have good
transactional models I actually like
this much over the previous generation
of speech systems where you had to learn
the vocabulary in my car I had to
understand which word to use this is no
flexible enough you can use Martin
understand me without any training but
as I said I think it becoming really
wise and smart and being a vehicle with
me and understand what I want it's a
long step the reason why I mention is
because I know you guys are hiring it's
an amazingly great field to be in right
now
I mean this is amazing but just think
about where it's going to be ten years
from now when I can come home and it
knows exactly what my favorite food is
and knows that the spinach has spoiled
this day and it reminds me of this or
maybe even ready in Amazon drones came
by and delivered it before I even
thought about it there's an amazing
vision that this can become you're
really a personal assistant in some
sense yeah that's absolutely the you
know the future that we can all look
forward to again several hard challenges
and realizing that as we you know speech
recognition is near solved we get very
high accuracy with no training or more
systems now the next step of course is
the conversational language
understanding I talked about once you've
done that the beyond that to get to the
kind of vision you're talking about
we now need reasoning we now need these
systems to be able to understand us and
reason about our world not just the
language part of it but listen about our
goals and our beliefs and our intents
and our desires and you know recognize
that you're home late and want a quick
meal and have that won't deliver to your
head of time I think that their next big
challenge in AI is going to be reasoning
systems natural language or otherwise
yeah it's gonna be compete and summation
you're going to look back at these
devices as dinosaurs and say what you
could touch them and so on and we could
probably text somebody else and it does
show me the time it does but there
wasn't my pocket and and and if this
technology becomes pervasive and and you
never ever attach the device again you
don't know what the devices are anymore
because with you and you go to your
office or go jogging and then there's
another device with you and it just
seamlessly integrates that is going to
be the
oh of computer science and and so many
of us get stuck like they think okay the
mainframe time was mainframes in the
smartphone a smartphone is the ultimate
thing to do and they can't really think
ahead what's next I think this is
showing us the way ahead I agree with
that I think the future of computing is
where we won't see computers anymore
we kind of have that with with motors
the electrical motors and everything
around us we never see them we don't
talk about them we take it for granted
that they exist and they do the right
things for us the right time computing
should be like that do you both imagine
that computers will be embedded in our
environment all around us or do you
imagine it being embedded within us or
we're constantly carrying it as we are
carrying that dinosaur brick I for one
can't wait until at least one ship and
better than me which really really
upsets me they have to authenticate and
I would love to pay this on this way
honestly and I'm super happy to have a
chip implanted if that's what it takes
so they can just move around without
likely every sponsor so often I have to
go to my phone and read some two-factor
number and then punch it back into a
browser it was so wrong in my opinion
whether I go further I mean there's
there's certainly I mean if you really
go far out I think there's an
opportunity to a brain interface that's
better than speech right now our brains
are limited in part because our own IO
is not very good yeah very slow and
speaking we're slow and listening so
maybe you're gonna get through the
system that newborn babies know a lot of
stuff about the world already because
they have a brain in their face I don't
know but before that happens I just
envisioned that a my clothing my
environment my building and so on will
have this pervasive network of whatever
it was sort of Amazon echo that is able
to listen to me understand me and and
assist me yeah you agree with that
vision as well I think there there is a
value to having a conversational
interface in addition to having a brain
and face just like typewriters didn't go
away I don't think voice will go away
once you have brain emphasis there are
many use cases where you want for
example a conversational companion at
home yeah
you know babysitter for your kid or a
companion for an older person you don't
necessarily need a computer reading it
you're you know you have a great
grandmother's brain when the people live
to be 250 years old
you want them to will to talk to them so
there I think there's use cases for all
of them but I think computers will be
everywhere they'll be honest and they'll
be around us there's a great book
regarding the companion topic it's
called marjorie prime or it was a play
that was recently turned into a movie
and it really goes into AI and
companions i think it's a great great
film and a great play highly recommend
it on the topic of hiring which you
mentioned earlier and the topic of the
challenges in AI as you know we have an
artificial intelligence nanodegree
program at Udacity and we have the
self-driving car a nano degree program
that Sebastian pioneered what are the
challenges and skills that you think are
most important that students need to
have to tackle these challenges in the
near future so we are very excited to be
partnered with the AI nano degree at
Udacity and I've spoken to many of your
students I think they're bright and
they're great futures ahead of them one
of the interesting things about AI is
that when you think of this future world
with AI being embedded everywhere AI
jobs aren't just AI in AI they're in
every part of life
you know you're gonna need some
knowledge and understanding of AI so
what is that knowledge and understanding
right you need to understand how to make
sense of large amounts of data and build
models that will enable you to then
predict the future based on other new
data you might not have seen yet you
need to be able to do the kind of
reasoning and and inference that I
talked about you need to be able to do
problem-solving and decision-making that
is really data-driven and also
contextual and knowledge driven and so
the the nanodegrees that york is
creating have a lot of the core
technology and or the core understanding
i think is you do need to understand the
algorithms and the math but it's really
more than just that it's trying to
understand what what are the kinds of
conceptual frameworks you bring to bear
when trying to solve the problem in the
computer science world are used to be a
professor
we call it computational thinking just
like you have design thinking and you
have other kinds of mathematical
thinking computational thinking is a way
of thinking about problems and there's
AI thinking is another newfangled way
now that is emerging and will become
pervasive what i find fascinating is the
way recent work in the AI is changing
the way we program computers and so in
the past software engineer would sit
down and think about every
the contingency and so if you're right
say an Android operating system there's
12 million possible contingencies and
you're right is amazingly long kitchen
recipe like if this happens to this if
this happens if this happens to this and
then iterate to this and because it's so
hard to anticipate the contingencies you
would pay these people lots of money and
of course many of you to see students
expecting to me a lot of money and
hopefully make lots of money doing this
but the transition to machine learning
now is is kind of much more I think much
more humane we don't tell kids in the
first 18 years of life every possible
contingency and then let them out we let
them learn that we give them examples
and then make up their own rules and
they learn from their own data and now
we're at the point where our air systems
we can actually teach them based on data
so rather than telling it this is
exactly what this vowel looks like it's
exactly how we pass these documents how
exactly respond let them look at data
and that's what deep learning really has
done to us in artificial intelligence
and I think it's a paradigm shift not
just for AI it's a paradigm shift for
all of computer science in the future I
think there'd be much stronger component
of trusting our machines to find their
own rules than having to sit down and
giving them all the words per hand and
one of the effects of that is going to
be that these machines will all be
different from each other
even today you're relaxed assert in your
house are different from mine because
they're personalized they learn about me
they know what music I have and what
kinds of what time I wake up in the
morning as you fast forward that into
the future these self learning machines
are all gonna be different so you know
nowadays if you go out and buy any piece
of technology a car or computer they're
all identical if you buy the same model
that will no longer be the case
different training data and every
household engage oh yeah I'm an
identical twins tonal to be often very
different it's not the DNA that makes
them different it's the environment yes
different many different experiences so
these AIS have experiences as well and
it's and as Sebastian said it's all
about so learning from those experiences
so the the programmers of today are
people who know how to design models
that can learn from experiences as
opposed to building code and there's the
complete new skill skill set that
doesn't exist today you go to any major
college you learn how to code and so on
but this new kind of programming is so
brand-new and so interesting and I think
it's just now coming to the point where
you have really interesting results like
soft
cars cancer diagnostics legal documents
curry speech recognition natural
language understanding all these things
are not getting to the point that I
become really really interesting is
Amazon hiring dr. Amin we're hiring a
ton in Amazon is hiring a hundred
thousand people this year across all the
different businesses a lot of people
have Alexa is hiring as well and we are
certainly super excited about our
partnership with Udacity we have our
recruiters talking to your folks and we
have a pipeline of really good people I
see more and more candidates with some
kind of Udacity nano degree on them
which is nice I have a question for you
if you had a magic wand to solve one
hard technology problem what would it be
like something that bugs you over a wake
up in the morning and say and this is
really in the way of meetings whatever
you want to build my biggest wish would
be I think the big gap right now in
India is is then what people sometimes
called the knowledge graph is knowing
enough about the world so the
data-driven vision that we talked about
is great when you have all that data you
have all the computers power and you can
sort train these machines with all
possible contingencies that you might
have seen when you're in something new a
new situation new use case new problem
you want to address or when again back
to the example when we are just talking
we share a lot of knowledge about the
world how do we capture that shared
knowledge and make it available to
computers very interesting when when I
started yeah and so when you say I there
were much more than knowledge-based
world like psych holding up this big
knowledge base and so on and now we seem
to be much more in the perceptual world
where we can like recognize worlds and
recognize images and so on do you think
the pendulum will swing back I think it
will merge I want to see hybrid
solutions I've worked in for years as
have you in the knowledge base
paradigm I know its strengths and his
weaknesses and now with the data and
machine learning paradigms
there are certainly limitations there as
well we're gonna need both I think the
big problem we haven't solved yet is how
we merge them there's some so ad hoc
solutions out there we use a little of
this little of that
but no truly integrated approaches yet
one more question in the media a is
often discussed in some very ambivalent
terms like if you talk to people like
Elon Musk they believe the AI evil and
slave us
Kailas possibly on forever you built
probably the most direct system that is
in touch with all of us my Alexis listen
to me all day long I gave a constraint
that some smarty I made break loose
listen to me and take control of me I'm
not concerned about that I think you
know I'm not any more concerned about
that and I'm concerned about you know
smart people breaking news you know my
kids or friends or strangers as well
occasionally there are they're wrong
people and they will be they may be
wrong guys but that's not the dominant
future I think these these a eyes they
grow up in our world they're socialized
in our world and as we get more nor
towards ya as they truly learn from
experience they're gonna learn our
values as well and then a lot of good
people working on the ethics of AI and
building ethics into the AI I don't know
that we necessarily have to build it in
as a rule I think it's something that
emerges from the kind of data that they
encounter in the world that they live
and they learned from us totally with
you so in addition to being a founder of
a very successful e-learning company
you're also technologists if you had a
magic wand it could waive that what
technology or science problem would you
like to have solved I would literally
love to get computers into my brain I
mean if we look at like my example the
Google self-driving car was that the
self-driving car would surpass human
driving and it was predictable and the
reason is when we people make a driving
mistake I learned from it or maybe you
learn from it but I won't learn from
your mistakes and you weren't from a lot
for my mistakes so all of us have to
make the same mistakes and that's an
impediment to progress but it's been in
Google search term in comics and mistake
all the other ones learn from it
including all the unborn cars so I would
love to have a world where we birth a
child and they're as smart as a high
school graduate oh I have a PhD and I
know something interesting and of course
it's physiologically impossible today
but perhaps we instead of having to
train all these things or life maybe we
can just know them and we gotten very
close honestly and I think if I can
google anything right now or can echo
anything and I get the facts right there
and it's a big game-changer for me
because now I know about Afghanistan
know about it
war and all these things just by
googling it when I need it but it's
still effort involved in progress if I
would have that I just know these things
so can I make a device that I recognize
every face ever seen
I recognize over any conversation of a
head and really big put my my brain on
steroids so I can actually learn
mother's mistakes much faster that would
it's hard to think about today probably
involves some crazy implant and I'm not
sure people would vote I have a crazy
implant but you know everything is
possible
I'll beta test for sure I say sign me up
my friend Eli breast cert is very
passionate about the same topic he's a
data scientist at Netflix and he's very
passionate about the fact that humans we
pass away and when a human being passes
away we lose all of that knowledge and
all of that experience and all of the
intuition and the intuitive choices we
make so if you're a surfer and you go to
the beach and you know the waves are you
know choppy you have this intuitive
feeling oh it feels like Sharky waters
or it's all this experience that's lost
so I hope that that future comes to pass
yeah I'm cuffin go back I don't know
about little more than how years ago
with the world's expert on flight met
yeah and they determined absolutely
flight is impossible after many decades
of trying it was just secretly and Kitty
Hawk two brothers invented flight at the
same time and they didn't know about it
and so on of a sudden oh my god as
possible so all these things then people
say it's impossible my take is just wait
okay there's typically things are
possible in my opinion and many things
have you deemed impossible today my
voice is strong enough that I can that
it carries to Australia right so I take
this thing over here and I talked to
some of Australia's it's amazing there
was deemed to be impossible for the vast
majority of human history so having a
brain interface to me seems very
possible and we're pretty close in some
some areas there's some very nice brain
interfaces for example for disabled
people and locked-in patients and the
next step is the kind of world that
might allow all of us to augment our
brain not just to control things right
like you know you know in the case of
several people today but also in terms
of to ingest the sum total of human
knowledge they'd be amazing I'd be like
the matrix
no better better much better I think
abuse of human bodies for energy it
makes no sense to me whatsoever
I met when neo learns kung-fu in like an
instant you could learn anything in like
seconds that's amazing well that's it
for time that's all the questions we
have today Thank You Ashwin and thank
you
Thank You Sebastian thank you both for
being here today and just greatly
appreciate it
and thank you for watching join us next
