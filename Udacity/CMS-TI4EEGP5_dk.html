began at Duke University has the
clinical context object workshop or CCO
w it seeks to facilitate the integration
of diverse applications at the point of
use it does this by managing issues such
as the identity of a patient the user
wants to view or update via these
applications the identity of the user
who wants to access the applications a
moment in time around which temporal
data displays should be centered by the
applications and a particular patient
encounter that the user wants to review
the details are highly technical but you
can get the general idea from this
illustration where several applications
from different vendors are all centered
around the same patient at the same time
for the same clinician this is an
ambitious but potentially very important
effort since clinicians commonly
complain about the time and effort
involved to use many different systems
that work in different ways to manage
their patients before moving on I want
to mention an interesting feature of the
smart on fire app platform this is
called launch parameters these provide
some of the same services as anticipated
in CMS as providers patients and other
users move about among fire apps as
shown here these include the identity
the patient the current encounter being
viewed links to other resource instances
of interest with this patient and even
the reason why the app is being launched
here is an example of a JSON formatted
version of one of the simplest fire
resources the patient it contains the
basic demographic information such as
name birth date and the provider taking
care of the patient it also contains a
patient ID that can be used to
unambiguously retrieve other clinical
information look a bit more carefully
and you'll see that this patient is
actually our old friend
