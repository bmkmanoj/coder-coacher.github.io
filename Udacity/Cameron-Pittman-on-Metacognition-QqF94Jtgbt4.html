a course developer here at Udacity he's
going to talk to us a little bit about
metacognition so thank you for talking
to us today happy to be here so the
first thing I want to ask is the reason
why I'm talking to Cameron about
metacognition is the Udacity has started
a new type of doing a class they call
our an hour and can you tell us a little
bit about what that is sure r and r is
not a replacement for the classroom it's
just another way to engage students our
classes are essentially series of as you
guys probably well no videos questions
problems projects and some short
readings and that's actually where we're
extending the classroom here with rnr
rnr is actually I think it sets for
reading and reflection it's essentially
a set of topics online or blog posts or
news articles or any kind of writings
online that are relevant to the course
and what we simply do is ask students to
read them and then reflect in the forums
it's just another way of trying to
engage students in introducing them to
material that's out in the world so it's
worth noting that when they started the
are in our way of doing classes here at
Udacity I didn't know about it and they
did it in parallel to me designing this
class and so this RN our approach is
very much what we do in this class where
it's all about readings and going out
and finding your own resources and
reflecting on them and sharing them with
classmates but something I'd ask for
both these students in this class as
well as for general understanding of the
way this is used is this for everybody
or is this a kind of approach that
specifically for people who don't learn
from traditional methods that don't like
to learn from lectures that they need an
alternative way or is this the better
way to learn for everybody I I would
never couch something as a better way to
learn for everybody because everybody
learns differently right you know there
are different modes of learning some
people learn better visually auditorily
or in discussion Noli okay that's not a
way but anyways you know so this is just
another way of introducing students to
material that they wouldn't normally see
and I think this is a great method
because as a developer which is what
we're training people to become you have
to be up to date with current news you
have to be up to date with the current
thoughts on whatever technology is
you're working with and rnr is just a
great way to reflect that so it's not
replacing anything and I don't think
it's necessarily a better way to learn
it's just another way of introducing
students to the world around them yeah I
like it a lot because it's also it
doesn't just teach you
the the content that you're learning
about it and just teach you how to
design a form or how to write a line of
code but it also teaches you that in the
future when you encounter a problem you
don't know how to solve how would you go
out and solve it and that's almost more
important it's one thing to teach
someone something but it's something
else to teach them how to solve their
future problems and not to mention it
also introduces students to developer
communities you start meeting other
people or seeing other people who are
interested in the same technologies and
give students a chance to get involved
absolutely so um since this is an EdTech
class though one question I would have
is is technology aside from this being
in computer science so let's imagine for
a second we're doing rnr in English
class or something like that how does
technology actually help with this is it
a core part of the rnr process or is it
just that because we're teaching
computer science here at Udacity we tend
to use it in new technology along with
this well I mean I think technology in
this case is just a better way to do
paperwork you know you could easily do
this in the class and you know millions
of teachers probably have you know you
assign a reading to your students get
them to read that's essentially all
we're doing here and technology just
makes it easier you know it's it's not
necessarily better or worse it's just
easier and more accessible to students
it sounds like it introduces a kind of
more rapid feedback cycle because
instead of having to go to the library
final encyclopedia read about it go home
and realize I read the wrong thing I can
go through that cycle in a minute
instead of in a day so it really lets
them go through that more more often so
if we have any students in the class who
want to apply an approach like this and
our and our style approach our approach
that really Foster's metacognition and
their project that they develop for this
class doing suggestions for what they
should think about while they're doing
it yeah sure so one of the nice things
about rnr is it lets students go at
their own pace and gives them control
over what they're learning and then what
they do with what they're learning
because they're simply reflecting on it
and maybe they hate the article maybe
they loved the article maybe they want
to share it maybe they don't but either
way they have the power to do all these
things and that actually is a huge part
of learning is having the power to
control what you're learning and how
you're learning and what you're going to
do with what you've learned and so any
kind of tool that gives students that
kind of power is obviously a good way to
go great well thank you so much for
talking to us yeah happy to be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
