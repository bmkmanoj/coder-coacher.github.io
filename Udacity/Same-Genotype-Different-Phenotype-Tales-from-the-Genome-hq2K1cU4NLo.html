exerts its main effect by aiding the DNA
repair machinery in breast cells but
obviously there are a lot of other
factors both genetic and environmental
that contribute to won the overall
mutation rate and a cell as well as the
cells ability to repair those mutations
other environmental factors that
generally affect DNA mutation and repair
could be things like UV exposure
particularly for tissues in your skin or
cigarette smoking particularly affecting
tissues in your lungs these can increase
the chance for DNA damage thus making it
more likely that a repair may not happen
and there are even more genetic and
non-genetic factors that contribute to
risk in far less well understood ways
for most women who develop breast cancer
it's due to a combination of many of
these different environmental and
genetic factors let's say that we have
two women who've been analyzed for eight
genetic factors associated with risk for
breast cancer at the end of the test we
see that they have the same alleles for
each of these eight genetic factors they
both test the same for each of those
eight alleles unless they have the same
calculated risk for breast cancer but
one of the women goes on to develop
breast cancer where's the other one does
not I want you to tell me how or why
this is even possible they have the same
genetic makeup for these eight genetic
factors they have the same calculated
genetic risk but one got breast cancer
and the other one didn't go ahead and
