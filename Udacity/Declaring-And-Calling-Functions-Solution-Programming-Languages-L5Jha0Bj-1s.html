about this statement X is already in
scope in fact it's 3 so this is going to
assign X to be four I don't think this
will prevent us from printing Sinbad
this one though says X is x divided by
zero division by zero doesn't really
make sense and will typically cause the
Python interpreter to stop and say you
are asking me to do impossible math and
thus not execute subsequent statements
assigning X the string value returned
doesn't have the same effect is actually
executing a return statement so this
won't help us but X equal Y well if this
is the entire program then there is no y
in scope so Python will yell at us and
say oh you're referencing an undefined
variable so just to make these examples
clear let's actually see it in the
interpreter this time I've left in x
equals x plus 1 which should not prevent
us from seeing Sinbad up and there is
but if I print out X gets x divided by 0
no we don't get Sinbad and instead we
get this error message from Python blah
blah blah blah blah the part here at the
bottom is the most important 0 division
error integer division or modulus x 0
well we did ask you to do that so it's
our own fault similarly x equals y we
don't see Sinbad and instead we see name
error global name why is not defined so
both of those two errors caused us not
to see Sinbad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
