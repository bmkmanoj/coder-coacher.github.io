virtual world seem real is collision
detection and response collision
detection is just that you detect
whether two objects have moves such that
they overlap even modest forms of
collision detection can make a user feel
that they're in a virtual world instead
of a ghost that can pass through
anything for example simply shooting a
ray from the user's location and finding
the distance to the closest intersection
will reveal whether the users position
should be adjusted where the problem
begins to get complex is when you have
many objects in a scene with a brute
force approach you compare everything to
everything else for collision much of
efficient collision detection coding is
in creating data structures that quickly
call out possible collisions that can't
occur in a frame the other half of the
problem is collision response what to do
when two objects are found to have
collided this depends on a number of
variables including the velocity of the
objects and in this case the elasticity
of the materials collision detection is
done primarily on the CPU and most
programs at this point though there have
been some moves to offload the work to
the GPU or even custom chips this is a
complex subject entire books have been
written about it but this is all well
cover here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
