questions on arithmetic operations but I
want to talk about is somewhat trickier
aspect on how to do division with
integers let's say I have a piggy bank
full of pennies and then I want to know
how many dollars do I have in Java I can
compute that with the division operation
and there is a bit of a catch when both
operands on the left and on the right
hand side of the division slash are
integers then the quotient is formed and
the remainder is discarded
mathematically 435 divided by 100 is of
course four point three five and then
the point three five is gone the left
over is four as an integer and that
number here is now saved as the dollars
that's just what we want right 435
pennies is four dollars what if we also
want the pennies for that we have a
different operator called the modulus
operator and we often just pronounce it
as mod it yields the remainder of the
division by the operand on the right
let's try that out with 435 435 divided
by hundred is four so there's four times
100 going in here when we take those off
we're left with a remainder of 35 that
was no longer divisible by 100 that's
what the remainder operator heals so you
can see that by making an integer
division by a hundred and then also a
remainder operation with 100 then we get
the dollars and the cents value now it's
time for you to try this tell me what is
pennies integer divided by ten and
pennies mod ten</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
