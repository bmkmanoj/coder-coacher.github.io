every city is visited at least once
sounds like each clause must be
satisfied so we must basically ensure
that our satisfying assignment satisfies
it at least once so I think this one
here is closely related to this one down
here the main decision is the order in
which to visit the city's that is what
makes this problem hard and the
analogous decision that you have to make
for sat is deciding which variables to
set to true or to false so I think these
two here are quite closely related then
being able to visit a city more than
once but not having to do so i think
that is closely related to number four
because what we have here is one
variable is enough to satisfy a clause
but of course we can use more than one
variable to satisfy the clause that it
doesn't hurt if there's more variables
here that will evaluate to true so we
can satisfy a clause in multiple ways
but we don't have to one single variable
is enough and then finally saying that
each variable is either true or false I
think and this is probably the hardest
one to figure out then that is actually
quite closely related to saying that you
don't visit a city more than once on
purpose it means you basically have to
make a decision what city to visit next
and that is in my mind more or less
close to saying I'm setting a variable
to either true or false once you go
along the shortest tour you're always on
your way to a new city but again I
realize this might be a bit subjective
here let's use this relationship to try
and reduce SAT to shortest tour and I
think we should start out with this
relation here deciding true or false is
what makes SAT hard the main decision is
the order in which to visit the city's
so the important insight here is that we
should try and find some way to
represent true or false as an order in
which cities are visited and to assure
through that order also that you cannot
have an ambiguous assignment of true or
false so basically you have to make a
decision in which order you visit the
cities and that must represent either
true or false and to figure this out of
course that takes a lot of playing
around we
different networks so even though I had
learned the proof I didn't quite
remember how to do it and it took me 15
or 20 minutes to play around on a piece
of paper with a pen to find out how I
could represent true or false variables
as an order in which cities are visited
and there's many possibilities but i'll
show you what i came up with and then
explain that to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
