now but we'll come back to them later
let's look at some other ways that we
can use decimals we're going to look at
decimals and percents decimals and
percents are often used in currency and
in commercial business we can buy shoes
sweaters or electronics on sale and we
often want to know how much does
something actually cost by the end of
this segment you'll be able to find out
how much an item costs like a new pair
of shoes so here's the problem that
we're going to have you answer and come
back to later a pair of shoes cost
eighty dollars and is on sale for
forty-four percent off what will you pay
for the shoes the first thing we need to
recognize is this problem has a percent
in it % literally means per hundred or
out of 100 i can write forty-four
percent another way I know it's 44 out
of 100 or 44 / 144 divided by 100 is the
same thing as forty four hundredths
here's a grid of 100 squares or I have
one block of these hundred pieces I'm
going to have 44 of them so I'd have ten
twenty thirty forty forty four blocks
out of 100 or forty four hundredths and
that's this written as a decimal forty
four hundredths okay here are some other
percent's I could have twenty-three
percent six percent or two hundred
percent I'm going to convert these
percents to decimals sometimes we need
to convert percents to decimals in order
to use them in problems or to multiply
okay so let's use these hundred blocks
to help us out here I have twenty three
squares shaded out of 100 so 23 / 100 as
a decimal that's twenty three hundredths
for six percent I'm going to have six
blocks out of 100 so I have six blocks
out of 100 or six hundredths point zero
six notice that the six has to be in the
hundredths spot for two hundred percent
I know that I have to do something
different I could color on a hundred of
the squares in this one block so i have
a hundred block shaded but i need two
hundred percent this is only a hundred
out of 100 that's a hundred percent two
hundred percent means 200 out of 100 I
know one of these squares represents a
hundred so I have
200 hundreds or I just have to or two
blocks okay there's actually a pattern
here that we want to notice let's look
closely at the decimal places here in
twenty three percent the decimal is here
and then it ended up here for six
percent the decimal started here and
ended up here for two hundred percent
the decimal started here and ended up
there let's have a quiz behind what's
going on with this pattern what do you
