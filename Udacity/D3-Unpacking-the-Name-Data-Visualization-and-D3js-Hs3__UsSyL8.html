because I think it speaks to why the
library is created and how it integrates
data with a webpage data-driven
documents data in this case refers to
some information we are trying to
visualize be it CSV or a JSON load
externally are simply a JavaScript
object or variables documents is a
reference to a web page a web document
rather a collection of HTML CSS
JavaScript and SVG often but hey
data-driven HTML or data-driven pages
just didn't have the same ring to it and
ribbon d3 binds data to the document or
rather more concretely rows of a CSV or
JSON to SVG elements more formally
documents doesn't only refer to the
source of the page and the content of
the HTML CSS JavaScript or SVG but it
could also refer to what's called the
document object model or Dom web
browsers can be thought to store two
versions of the web page or rather to
views one of which is the initial source
as I mentioned they get returned from
the web server and the other is a parsed
Dom object the document object model is
a specification much like HTML and CSS
that specifies a common programming
interface for HTML and XML documents
once the source of the HTML is returned
from the server the web browser parses
the file and transforms it into a
hierarchical object that can be accessed
programmatically most often through
JavaScript called the Dom d3 actually
binds data to the Dom rather than the
source or visual elements of the HTML
but since the Dom actually represents it
can interact with what's displayed
visually
we bind dated to the dom d3 drives the
document in this case the visual
representation of the dom and creates a
chart based on the data that's in the
dumb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
