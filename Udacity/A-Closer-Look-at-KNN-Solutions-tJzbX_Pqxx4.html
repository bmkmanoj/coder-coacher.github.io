evaluate various machine learning
algorithms let's start back with kN and
look a little more closely at the sorts
of solutions it provides let's start
with our training data and remember
we've got pairs of x and y so each one
of these dots represents one training
tuple and I'm just making this data up
of course let's suppose we were going to
query this can--and model over in this
region say right here at this point well
the nearest three list let's use K
equals three here
the nearest three are going to be these
and remember we take the mean of their
value to get the value of at that query
point so if we query from here all the
way to about here our model it's going
to take the mean Y value of those so the
output of our model is going to look
something like this and notice it gives
the same value at all these points
eventually as we query from left to
right we get to a point where this one
gets dropped out and this one gets added
in and at that point we'll have a sudden
drop about like that in the model and we
continue on like this we'll have another
drop like that if we query our model now
from left to right in very very tiny
increments we'll get the result that
looks something like this
note that indeed there are sort of jump
points here some nice things about this
are that it's not overfitting the data
in other words it's not tagging each
point a negative aspect though is at the
ends there we have these you know
horizontal lines that are no longer
changing or you know essentially this
model is not able to extrapolate like we
might if we had a parametric model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
