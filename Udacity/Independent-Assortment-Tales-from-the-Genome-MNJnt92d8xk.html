understand and visualize all the
different combinations of chromosomes
you can have after meiosis but what I do
want you to see is that genes on
homologous chromosomes or jeans on pairs
of chromosomes have an equal probability
of their alleles assorting to either
gamete during sex cell formation we're
going to demonstrate this concept called
independent assortment with a deck of
cards let's imagine that each card in
this deck represents a chromosome so
here we're going to start with
chromosome one with the ACE is
chromosome one chromosome 2 number 2 of
spades chromosome 3 4 5 6 right on up
the line chromosome 10 and then Jack
queen king will be 11 12 and 13 now
obviously we should have at least 10
more chromosomes here to represent the
full 23 but we're going to keep things
simple and just use these 13 cards or
chromosomes representing one suit from a
deck of cards now in your germ cells
just like every other cell type in your
body you have two copies of every
chromosome so now we have our two copies
to chromosome ones to chromosome tues to
chromosome threes to chromosome fours
and remember one of these sets of
chromosomes you got from mom and the
other set of chromosomes you got from
dad now and the last exercise we talked
about an individual who was heterozygous
for both lactose intolerance and
dwarfism the gene controlling the trait
for lactose intolerance is lactase and
it can be found on chromosome 2 and the
gene controlling dwarfism fgfr3 can be
found on chromosome 4 now that
individual was heterozygous for lactose
intolerance meaning they had one
dominant copy for the lactase
persistence allele they had one
recessive allele for lactase non
persistence and that individual was also
heterozygous for dwarfism meaning that
they had one recessive copy for normal
fgfr3 function here and one dominant
allele for dwarfism here so the first
step is to duplicate our DNA or
duplicate our chromosomes now obviously
there's a lot going on here in this
frame so we want to simplify things a
bit let's actually get rid of all those
other chromosomes and focus on
chromosomes two and four well you're
about to see holds true for all the
other chromosomes but obviously if
they're all moving around at the same
time it's way too much for us to handle
so before duplication we have one two
three four chromosomes that we're
looking at here and after duplication we
still have four chromosomes one two
three and four they're just duplicated
chromosomes now remember from lesson to
this is the difference in the the single
linear chromosome and the ex looking
chromosome these would be the ex looking
chromosomes now that we've doubled our
DNA it's time to start cell division now
this means in the case of meiosis we're
going to go through two stages of cell
division so let's do the first one here
we need to separate our pairs of
chromosomes so take our pair of
chromosome tues here we have our
duplicated chromosomes we have the mom
copies and we have the dad copies and
what's going to happen is in a Cell we
randomly distribute which pair goes to
which side now we're going to do the
same thing for the pair of chromosome
fours okay we've done our first round of
cell division here and you'll notice it
over here on the Left we got our
dominant allele for lactase persistence
on chromosome 2 along with our recessive
allele for dwarfism on chromosome 4 and
on the right side we have our recessive
allele for lactase persistence here on
chromosome 2 and the dominant allele for
dwarfism on chromosome 4 now this was
completely random we could have just as
easily have the combinations ended up
where the two dominant alleles were
ended up on the same side of the two
recessive alleles ended up on the same
side so let's go back to the scenario
that we originally had now it's time to
do our second cell division so this time
we're going to line up in the middle and
now we're going to randomly split our
pairs up to either side now after the
second round of division we have four
cells for combinations here and notice
we have two that are the same the
recessive allele for lactase non
persistence and the dominant allele for
dwarfism and these two cells ended up
with the dominant allele for lactase
persistence and the recessive allele for
normal bone growth so that's two
possible combinations right there but if
we back up to our original division when
we got the dominant lactase persistence
on the left and the recessive version on
the right we could have instead had our
chromosome
for go to the opposite side that it did
before and we get our two dominant
alleles on the same side and our two
recessive alleles together and then when
we go through our second division</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
