might go about building an explanation
that shows that the object that had
these properties in fact is an instance
of this concept of a cup what I will do
here is to first sketch out the
explanation for you and then I will
discuss how the AI agent actually goes
about building the explanation let us
first consider this part this is an
abstraction that we learn from the bowl
the object carries liquid because it is
concave it is a similar abstraction
learn from the briefcase the object is
liftable because it is light and it has
a handle here is the obstruction that
the air agent learned from the glass the
glass enables drinking because it
carries liquids and because it is
liftable so in this way the obstruction
learned from the glass gets connected to
the abstractions learn from the bowl and
the obstruction learned from the
briefcase noted the effect here in the
abstraction from the bowl has become the
cause for the effect that was the
abstraction from the class similarly
here the affected object is liftable was
learned from the briefcase example but
in the context of the class this becomes
a cause for object enable sprinkling now
let's shift to the fourth example for
brick from there one learns that the
object is stable because it is a bottom
and the bottom is flat now we can
connect this causal chain and this
causal chain into a more complex causal
explanation for why this object is a cup
recall that we had said earlier in the
definition of a cup that an object is a
cup if it is stable and it enables
drinking now we have shown that in fact
this particular object is a cup because
it is stable and it enables drinking in
practice when an AI agent actually goes
about building this explanation it works
backwards from the definition of the cup
it knows that in order for an object to
be a cup the object must be stable and
the object must enable drinking so the
area incenses goal of proving that the
object is stable into its memory memory
returns the example of a brick because
of brick is stable but the brick said
that the brick is stable because
it has a bottom at the bottom is flat so
the AI agent abstracts is caused a
relationship from the Brig example and
applies it to the object here similarly
for this part another aspirin the
definition of the cup was that enables
linking so how can the agent prove to
the object enables drinking this object
it exceeds in the kitchen the agent
sends the goal of proving that the
object enables drinking into its memory
memory returns the example for glass
because the glass enables drinking it
abstracts from grass the fact that the
object must carry a liquid in the object
must be liftable in order to enable
drinking that set such new explanatory
sub goals how can the agent now prove
that the object can carry liquid that
goes back into the memory and the
example of a bowl is found and I think
you can now see how the rest of the
explanation process will work no
disconnects with a couple of lessons we
have learned earlier first you can see
problem reduction in application here we
wanted to prove that object is a cup to
do that we reduce the problem into two
smaller and simpler problems let's prove
that object is stable and let's prove
that object enables drinking and so on
and so forth second disconnects with the
notion of planning when we were
discussing planning we had open
preconditions those were preconditions
of a goal which we needed to satisfy we
use those open preconditions to select
operators a similar thing is happening
here when we want to prove that the
object is a cup then we have to open
preconditions object is stable and
object enables drinking these
preconditions and become levels for
selecting explanatory proofs ex-military
fragments that can help fulfill those
preconditions so the scenario of a robot
proving that an object is a cup is a
little bit of a longer term scenario
we're still a ways away from having
robots to walk around our house and
retrieve cups for us to take an example
perhaps from the near future I can
imagine one day having a word processor
it has built into it some intelligence
such that instead of choosing a file
based strictly on its file name I can
say something like get me that important
document from last Tuesday I myself
might not remember the file name or
where I saved it but I remember that
last Tuesday I was working on an
important document the intelligent
search from the word processor with an
iterator of the documents and say can I
both
prove that the document is important and
it is from last Tuesday now the word
processor might not have a notion of
importance built into it naturally but
in those documents I've considered
important in the past and it might start
to notice that documents that have my
header on them and have my signature at
the bottom are important and from there
it can start to build a case for why
that particular document is important
coupled with just being able to read the
timestamp and see if it's from last
Tuesday it should be able to retrieve
from me documents that might be both
important and from last Tuesday without
me ever really knowing what the document
file name was or where I saved it this
kind of explanation based learning
actually occurs in over everyday life so
you and a constantly improvising papers
are blowing off my desk how can I stop
them from blowing off so and it's
something to stop them blowing away what
is available what connect as a
paperweight a cup here is a cup let me
put her in the papers this is an example
of improvisation we use explanation
based learning to realize that and it is
heavy as and as a flat bottom can act as
a paperweight it is another example I
need to pop up on a door a door stopper
is not available what can I use perhaps
an eraser or a chair you and I do this
kind of improvisation all the time and
often we are building these explanations
that tell us that an eraser can be used
as the door stopper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
