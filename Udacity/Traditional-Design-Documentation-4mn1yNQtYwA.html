included information about the
components you've carved the system up
into what their responsibilities are
what their primary data flows are and so
on other elements of traditional
documentation include how you're going
to deal with performance considerations
and resource consumption by resource
here we might mean memory we might mean
use of peripherals bandwidth and so on
if that's not enough for you if your
organization needs more detailed
documentation you might rely on some I
Triple E standards such as standard one
zero one six some of the key elements
that the standard add to the list that
is traditionally used are things like
who is the designer it might be nice to
know if you have to go back for a
question who was responsible for a
particular piece of the design what are
the dependencies among the elements are
there hidden assumptions that one
component is making about other
components what are the trade-offs among
the non-functional constraints how did
you decide to take a particular
trade-off what assumptions are you
making about your users about the
technology that will be available for
the hardware and about the changing
customer base and which particular views
of the software system is your
