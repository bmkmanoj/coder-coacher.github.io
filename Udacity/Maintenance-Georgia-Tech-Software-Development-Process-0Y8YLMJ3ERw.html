development efforts normally result in
the delivery of a software product that
satisfies the user requirements so
normally our software development
organization will release this
application to its final users however
once the software is in operation many
things can happen so for example the
environment might change there might be
new libraries there might be new
operating systems in which our software
has to operate or there may be feature
requests so the users might find out
that guess what they might want to do
something different with the problem
that we gave them or again and with this
is one of the most common occurrences
users might find problems with the
software and my file bug report and send
the bug report back to the software
developer these are the reasons why
software maintenance is a necessary
phase in software development software
maintenance is the activity that
sustains the software product as it
evolves throughout its lifecycle
specifically in response to bug reports
feature requests and environment changes
development organizations perform three
kind of maintenance activities
corrective maintenance to eliminate
problems with the code perfective
maintenance to accommodate feature
requests and in some cases just to
improve the software for example to make
it more efficient and finally adaptive
maintenance to take care of environment
changes and after these activities have
been performed the software developer
will produce a new version of the
application will release it and the
cycle will continue throughout the
lifetime of the software that's why
maintenance is a fundamental activity in
a very expensive one and one of the
reasons why maintenance is expensive
that I want to mention now is a
regression testing during maintenance
every time you modify your application
you have to regression test the
application where regression testing is
the activity of retesting software after
it has been modified to make sure that
the changes you perform to the software
work as expected and that your changes
did not introduce any unforeseen effect
I'm pretty sure that you're familiar
with the case of a new version of the
software being released and just a
couple of days later another version be
released to fix some problems that occur
with a new version these problems is
what we call regression errors and
they're what regression testing targets
and tries to eliminate before the new
version of the software is released into
the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
