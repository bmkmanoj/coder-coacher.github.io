show you just a little bit of the
possibility of doing some compiler
optimizations now notice this sort of
barrier here where we introduced lambda
where we introduce a function remember I
said that there's two parts to a
compiler there's the part where we're
first defining language so when we call
lit and give it a string then we're
doing some work to build up this
function that's going to do the work
every time we call it again and anything
that's on the right of the lambda is
stuff that gets done every time anything
that's the left is stuff that gets done
only once now notice that there's a part
here building up this set of s that I'm
doing every time but that's wasteful
because s doesn't depend on the input s
is always going to be the same so I can
pull this out and do it at compile time
rather than do it every time we call the
resulting function so I'll take this set
of s and I'll give that a name that of s
and then over here I'll do set of s
equals that value well it looks like I
better break this up into multiple lines
so now I pulled out that pre-computation
so it only gets done once rather than it
gets done every time and you could look
around for other places to do that I
could pull out the computation of this
set of care characters and do that only
once as well that's a lifting operation
that stops us from feeding over and over
again what we only need to do once and
that's one of the advantages of having a
compiler in the loop is that there's a
place to do something once rather than
to have to repeat it every time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
