cleverly so I when I when I see things
like this I just like to be methodical
so why don't we just be methodical so
I'm gonna ask the question whether the
VC dimension is at least one because
that's pretty easy to think about and
maybe I'll get a feel for how to how to
get the right answer that way okay so
the VC dimension at least one well the
answer is pretty clearly yes so if you
just put a dot on the number line
somewhere you could yeah like that you
could label it positive just by picking
any a less than or equal to that point
and any be greater than go to that point
so if I were like drawing parentheses or
something to indicate the interval I
could just put parentheses around the
point and that would give me a plus for
brackets that would be fine okay so
that's that's pretty easy
and if I wanted it to be negative I can
just put both of the brackets on either
side of the point it doesn't matter
let's say to the left alright that make
sense Michael that's exactly what I was
thinking about yeah though I would have
put the brackets on the right yeah you
would okay so then we could see do the
same argument for see if the VC
dimension is greater than or equal to
two so if I put two points on the line
so there are only there are four
possibilities I've got to get plus plus
minus plus plus minus and minus - okay
so we got to get plus plus plus minus
minus plus and minus minus so the the
first and last one are really easy
actually they're all easy you can
definitely do this so if you want to get
plus plus you just need to put the
brackets so that they surround the two
points that's good if you want to get
plus minus you put the left bracket in
the same place and you put the right
bracket just to the right of the point
yeah and you do the same thing for minus
plus and then for minus - you put the
brackets on either side of the both of
the points and so since you like it to
the right I'm gonna put them to the left
good and there you go that was that was
pretty easy I think okay so next we need
to figure out whether the VC dimensions
at least three so we need three dots on
a line three distinct dots on the line
and we've got eight possibilities but
Michael I don't want you to write down
those those
possibilities because I think I see an
easy way to answer the question right
away excellent so this is a lot like the
last example we did with with the theta
except well now we have two parameters
and the problem we have with the theta
is that as we move the theta over from
left to right we lost the ability to
have a positive followed by a negative
so I think there's a similar thing here
so if you label those three points this
way plus minus and plus I don't I don't
think you can do that and that's because
in order to get point one and point
three in the interval you're gonna have
to put the brackets on both sides of
them so you're gonna have to put a left
bracket to the left of the first point
and a right bracket to the right of the
third point and that's the only way to
make those two plus but then you're
always going to capture the one in the
middle so you can't actually shatter
three points with this hypothesis class
now you have to argue though that there
isn't some other way you could arrange
the three points I don't know like I
don't know stacking them on top of each
other or something you mean yeah well
then they wouldn't be an R they'd be an
R - well no just like right on top of
each other well then they're all the
same point and you can't label them
again you have the same problem that you
can't label one of them negative and the
other ones positive they're on top of
each other so right - so there isn't
there just isn't any way to set up these
three points so that you're able to
assign them all possible labels right so
good so that gives us two as our answer
here so by the way I think that you said
something I think that's really
important in order to prove the lower
bound in order to prove one and two all
we had to do was come up with an example
where we could shatter right yes that's
exactly right
right so so that's good and that's
that's really nice because otherwise
we're we're gonna keep it trouble if we
have to show that you could shatter
every single thing we just have to show
that you can shatter one thing so it
exists so that whole VC dimension is
really there exist some set of points
you could chat or not you can shatter
everything that's right and what would
be an example of points that you
couldn't shatter yeah - a pair of points
that you couldn't chatter well the ones
on top of one another yeah exactly
because they you
be able to sign them different labels so
that would be a really bad choice anyway
here all we need is a good choice right
so if you make good choices you can
shatter things which sounds more violent
than I intended okay but in the third
case of the VC dimension it wasn't
enough to show an example that you
couldn't shatter because then you could
do the same thing as you point out with
a VC dimension of two instead you have
to prove that no example exists so there
does not exist or a for all not or
something like that for all not exactly
so that that's it that's interesting set
of a set of requirements there right so
proving a lower bound seems easier than
proving an upper bound though it's
interesting because in this case in the
one in cases one and two you had to show
that all the different combinations were
covered whereas in this last case we
just had to give one combination that
couldn't possibly be covered yeah but it
couldn't possibly be covered no matter
what we did no matter what the input
arrangement was right yeah
whereas in the first case I had to show
all possibilities I mean you know all
possible labelings but only for one
example of orderings or one collection
of points so just messily doing some bad
predicate calculus to nail down what
you're saying that when we say that the
answer is yes we're saying that there
exists a set of points of a certain size
such that for all labelings no matter
how we we want to label it there is some
hypothesis that works for that labeling
but to say no we have to do the negation
of that which is not exist for all
exists which by standard logic rules
says that that means that for all points
no matter how you arrange the points
it's not the case that for all labels
there exists a hypothesis which again de
Morgan's law is not against de Morgan's
law to to apply this idea that says
that's the same as for all arrangements
of points there's some labeling where
there's no hypothesis that's going to
work and that's exactly how you made
your argument huh except I didn't use de
Morgan's law and upside down A's and
backward Z's oh you did oh you did I am
done work of powerful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
