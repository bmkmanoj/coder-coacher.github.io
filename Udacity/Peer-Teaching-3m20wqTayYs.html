sort of real example that I'm gonna give
you and it's going to be in peer
teaching which hopefully is near and
dear to some of our listeners heart so
here's the idea the idea is that we've
got a student let's call this student
curly and we've got a teacher let's call
this teacher smooth and there's a bunch
of questions okay on some subject
because subject sub do you like
dinosaurs dinosaurs okay good so if you
don't your questions on dinosaurs you
draw a dinosaur okay there I've drawn a
dinosaur and white ink okay so what we
have here is we have a bunch of
questions about dinosaurs from it is no
Deinonychus no okay let's try that again
so what we have is we have a bunch of
questions and let's just say for the
sake of this discussion that we can sort
them and order them from really really
easy questions to really really hard
questions okay and what I really mean is
that things down here people with very
little knowledge about dinosaurs could
answer people up here you really have to
have learned a lot about dinosaurs and
it kind of moves between the spectrum
from from easy to hard does that make
sense yeah I guess as a course
approximation sure and so what we're
trying to figure out and then this is
important the goal here is to figure out
what incentives we can give to both the
student and to the teacher so that
learning happens over time so the goal
is learning and what we need to do is
design a mechanism and mechanism in this
setting means like a payoff function
essentially yeah because we're talking
game theory so in the end we're always
going to be talking about some kind of
payoff some way providing utility for
taking some kinds of actions in the
world now it's important of course this
is not just simply a one-shot game this
really is a case that we will be taking
actions over a period of time because of
course learning is gonna happen over a
period of time and we want to figure out
how we're going to get someone to kind
of give out these questions all we've
got right we've got a learning we've got
a teacher we've got a bunch of questions
we know they're easier or easy and hard
and we're gonna try to figure out what
we want the teacher to do and what we
want the learner to do so that learning
happens okay
so we need to design a mechanism that
will ensure the goal and just to be
clear is their assumption that answering
questions actually helps you learn or is
this just assessment
sort of assessment this is assessment
but of course if you can reliably answer
questions then it suggests that you know
something okay
does that make sense yeah I guess I'm
just wondering to what end right so so
what kind of questions should be asked
ones that helped me to figure out that
you've learned that you've learned yeah
okay now other stuff can be happening
here and there's you know whole
complicated things but readings can
happen in between there can be tutorials
or whatever but we're trying to make
this game really sort of simple to
illustrate the idea
so in between questions things might
happen okay and perhaps answering the
question requires that you go off and
you do some reading or do some work Oh
which could promote some learning which
could promote some money some of these
questions might be take implement five
supervised learning algorithms on two
data sets that are interesting run them
and write it to a HSA for example oh my
gosh that's a terrible assignment yeah
but you will learn something in the end
yeah you'll learn it some people give
terrible assignments that cause you to
learn mmm I think this was really
important here so you with me understand
kind of what it is we're trying to
accomplish I think so yeah okay cool so
let me give you a proposal for some
incentives and you tell me what you
think is going to happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
