JavaScript interpreter that has a bug
already in it if we go down to the part
of the JavaScript interpreter that
handles calling functions we can run
this sample webpage and discover that
what the correct answer is three and
four is actually becomes eight eight
eight and nine nine nine as it turns out
this very wrong answer is caused by a
very simple bug hopefully you ran a few
of your own test cases to narrow down
the problem but right here on this line
is the culprit our new environment the
environment in which we evaluate the
statements of the function body is the
env variable which comes from the call
and the value passed into env is
actually the environment from which we
call the function if you recall the
parsing for our JavaScript functions the
first element of the tuple is the string
function which says that this represents
a function the second is the parameters
for the function we then have the
function body which is just a sequence
of statements and then lastly we have
the environment for the function this is
the parent from which the function was
defined and it's actually the
environment in which we're supposed to
execute the function however with this
code that's not the case we're executing
the function in the environment from
which we call it not from which it was
defined so we need to fix that so I've
defined a variable function environment
which just grabs the fourth element or
the third index out of the tuple and
instead of creating the new environment
as env I want to do it fe + b which is
going to be the function environment
that we want and that's it the
consequences of the bug are pretty
severe but it's really just what do we
change 10 characters I mean that's just
how these bugs can be and can be really
hard to find that's why finding bugs is
time-consuming difficult and it's a
skill that you're going to have to learn
because it's just part of programming
you're going to make mistakes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
