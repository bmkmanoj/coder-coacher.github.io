promised that we would link up these two
chains and use the transitivity of
reductions to show that vertex cover and
independent set are np-complete we now
turn to the last link in this chain and
will reduce three CNF SAT two
independent set as we've already argued
these problems are in NP so that will
complete the proof that they are
np-complete here's the transformation or
reduction we need to accomplish the
input is a three CNF formula with M
clauses and we need to output a graph
that has an independent set of size M if
and only if the input is satisfiable
will illustrate on this example for each
literal in the formula we create a
vertex in a graph then we add edges
between all vertices that came from the
same clause will refer to these as
within clause edges or simply the clause
edges then we add edges between all
literals that are contradictory b and b
bar can't both be true for instance we
refer to these as the between clause
edges or the contradiction edges the
implementation of this transformation is
simple enough to imagine and I'll leave
it to you to convince yourself that it
can be done in polynomial time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
