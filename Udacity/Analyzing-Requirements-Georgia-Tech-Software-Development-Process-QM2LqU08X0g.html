nouns and I'll start identifying the
ones that are relevant and I'll ask you
some questions or if you know if you can
ask me questions if you see something
that doesn't make sense to you good
enough okay this is it patron it seems
to me that patron is definitely an
important entity that's that's what it's
all about
okay all right so actually the way I'm
gonna do this I'm gonna take all these
relevant entities and I'm gonna start
putting them in what I call a class
diagram so you don't really need to know
what that is exactly but imagine there's
been a diagram in which I'm drawing I
represent in all the relevant items as
rectangles with a given name and then
later on some attributes okay okay and
I'm just gonna put in there so I'm gonna
start with patron I'm gonna create one
class for the patron I'm gonna give it
the name patron and by the way it's I
mean you probably figure out it's
important that we represent we use the
right names so that there it's clear
when we're looking at the class diagram
what we're referring to so I'll just use
did not denounce themselves as names
okay library card seems to be also a
relevant element every patron has a
library card all right perfect so we
just create a library card here and
let's see as long as they're in the
system and I saw that there's a system
here this concept of system this concept
of library and based on my experience
normally those are kind of an
overarching theme so this is really what
we are modeling so that the the only the
only thing that will make a difference
is if there were more than one library
or more than one system is that the case
we just want one system for our one
library okay so in this case I won't
even represent those because basically
what I'm representing is the system and
the library I understand implicit in
concept okay and then I'll name address
and phone number are interesting because
these are important entities but this
seems like you know they're not entities
in themselves so there are more
attributes of something else oh I would
imagine that this is the way you
identify or these are elements that are
important for the patron that's what
that's what we take down when we when we
issue the cards okay perfect so I'm
gonna take those and make those
attributes or the patron which means
that I'm gonna take the class that I
created before and I'm just gonna write
them down here
so that they're represented and we know
that these are kind of what
characterizes the patron gotcha okay and
then I guess a similar consideration for
the library card number so this seems to
be associated with a library card it's
printed right on it all right
so we'll put this as an attribute of the
library card then and then in addition
at any particular point in time
okay so time well time seems to be a
relevant entity right because time seems
to occur several times in this
description for example I think you guys
keep track of how long a book has been
loaned right right and there's some time
associated also here in a children's age
oh yeah the children's age here that I
didn't see before yeah so what I'm gonna
do I'm gonna represent this in a sort of
generic way as a date okay these are
kind of classes and utility classes we
call them that are normally in every
system so I'm just gonna put it down
here as a as a utility class that will
be used by different elements in the in
the diagram okay
so or to calculate the items so the
items also I mean I from what I know
about libraries I seem to be pretty
relevant elements right so these are
gold this is what we check out this is
what we're for okay so then items
definitely will become a class and then
we have do oh there's also this concept
of fines I guess it seems to be
important right you guys give fine so
people are late right right right
collect fines and so on so we create a
fine class down here and children so
children's children are special
customers right it's a just their age
makes the difference that the way works
right they can only check out a few
books okay so I'll create them special
kind of cases especially kind of
customers I'll just create here a class
for children and I can see that they're
characterized by a and their age right
so I'll just put the age here as an
attribute of the child and I mean okay
so the next one is restriction and the
restriction is kind of tricky because
just to be solid general concept so in a
sense although those are restrictions
right right this is just another another
one of these
quirements okay so so we don't need to
represent it explicitly right it's just
telling us how the chill okay it's just
another requirement so I just won't
consider that for now and oh I see that
these books and all your video materials
I guess these are things that the the
patrons can check out right those are
some of the items right oh the other
there are other two more down here right
reference books and magazines but but
they can't be checked out but they're
definitely in the life okay so then I'm
gonna represent all of those actually
now so I'm gonna have books I'm gonna
all your video materials reference books
and magazines and I'm just gonna have
those as classes then okay here we have
week and we already represented this
general concept of time so week will be
represented by the date class as well
and always see bestsellers so
bestsellers are also I guess items that
can be checked out right right okay so
I'll just represent those as a class as
well and an additional item that is
relevant for the library and the limited
this is also a time limit right right so
it can also be represented with the with
the class oh here we have sense and for
sense same consideration that I made for
time this is kind of a money is a
general concept that we know occurs in
many in many IT systems so I'm gonna I
just have a money class here which is
another utility class okay okay and oh
and here a value so value is a property
let me look again at the requirement oh
is the value of the item so value I'm
gonna put in the item as an attribute
okay that's how much it cost us okay
perfect
seems like we got them all right
anything I forgot it looks like it okay
so at this point what I like to do we
have a kind of a first take first cut at
the class diagram I like to kind of move
to that and go through the different
classes with you and I ask you some
questions again and you can tell me
whether something that kind of jumps at
you that's not not right and then we're
gonna try to refine that okay okay
that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
