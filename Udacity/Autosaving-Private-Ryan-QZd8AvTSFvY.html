will save every few seconds but how can
we call a method with a delay grand
central dispatch is your friend if we
look at the safe method in our core data
class the first thing you'll notice is
that it doesn't necessarily save it will
always check the context and see if
there is anything to save and if there
is then it saves this means we only
perform the save operation with all its
dependencies validating the leading etc
if it makes sense now we're going to add
a new method called autosave we still
have no idea how to implement it but who
cares when you don't know what to do
just do something and see what happens a
good method to organize your thoughts is
to break down the complex task into
smaller ones then write them down as a
series of comments we'll find out the
code we need along the way so let's get
started the first part is easy it's just
calling the safe method the second part
seems more complex but doc gave me a tip
he told me to use GCD check out the
documentation and see if you can find a
function in GCD that allows us to delay
something go on I'll wait yes there is a
function called dispatch after it takes
a closure and runs it after a certain
amount of milliseconds if we call
autosave inside that closure we have
what we're looking for a loop that saves
waits for a certain time and then saves
again just keep in mind that we're not
really saving every say five seconds
it's even better we check every five
seconds if there's anything worth saving
and only then we save let's get the code
for this one before moving on please
make sure to check out the documentation
for dispatch after and dispatch time
then make sure you understand this code
and then call autosave while passing 60
that would be one minute when your app
launches this way you'll be Auto saving
everyone
