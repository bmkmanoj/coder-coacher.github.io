points on the map we can give the user
more information about those points info
windows are pop up displays which are
shown at a given location either with or
without a marker they're great for
giving contexts such as text describing
a location or showing images related to
it creating an info window works very
similarly to the marker in that will use
an object and several basic parameters
creating a new info window instance only
requires that we put some content into
the info window a string or a predefined
set of elements the info window though
unlike the marker won't open
automatically we need to add one more
thing to tell it when and where to open
we're adding an event listener so that
the info window only opens when we click
on the marker within the event listener
will call the info window open method
passing in the map on which to open and
optionally the marker on which to anchor
it if we didn't pass in a marker we
would need to give the info window a
position property so that it has a place
to open so if we click on the marker we
can see our lonely info window but we
want to show a whole bunch of locations
we don't want to show the user just one
house I'm going to delete our single
point marker in info window so here
we've created an array of objects with
some listing titles and a bunch of lat
Long's in the initialize function so
that we have all of the information we
need in the browser in your own projects
we'd recommend using a database and
serving the information to your site
there are a bunch of features of the API
that allow you to easily render large
amounts of data onto your map you can
read more about them in the link in the
instructor notes for now since we only
have a few points we're just going to
keep the data in the browser now instead
of creating one marker will make a whole
bunch of them out of this information
will add a blank marker or a globally
since we'll have only one of these for
the listings in our site then we'll loop
through the locations we created in
order to create one marker / location
we'll keep each newly created marker
instance in the markers array to keep
them organized now we want an info
window to appear when any one of the
markers is clicked and we want the Conte
to reflect that Parker so we'll add an
on-click event to each marker will make
a separate function passing in the
marker that was clicked which is this
and the info window that we created on
initialize here this function is
essentially going to tell the info
window to open at that marker and
populate with information specific to
that marker will create this function
below each time one of our listing
markers is clicked this populate info
window function is going to be called
essentially all this is doing is setting
the content of the info window to the
markers title and opening the info
window on that marker finally we may
have listings that are outside the
initial zoom area and we want to be able
to adjust the boundaries of the map to
fit everything that we want the user to
see so we'll create a new lat long
bounds instance which captures the
southwest and northeast corners of the
viewport then we'll extend it for every
marker that we make and finally we'll
tell the map to fit itself to those
bounds voila we have a very basic
listing that if I click each marker a
brief description of the listing shows
above that marker once you can do that
there's a crazy number of things you can
do change your markers to be custom
icons put images links and other
information into the info windows and
more if I wanted to I could change all
of my markers to be pictures of OJ's
head but on a serious note let's make
one more improvement before we move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
