aware that you're dreaming so how can we
loosen dream well Stephen Leaburg an
expert in the field says that lucid
dreamers actually develop a mindset that
allows them to recognize that they're
dreaming and once they recognize that
they're dreaming they can actually
change the content of their dreams
that's right in proponents of lucid
dreaming thao a variety of benefits for
example in one pilot study they looked
at an individual who had nightmares and
the idea was if you could teach the
person to loose a dream and become aware
when they're having a nightmare they can
actually change the outcome of that
dream in this example the person did
actually experience fewer nightmares
although the mechanism of action or how
it happened still remains unclear there
are lots of great tips and tricks on how
to engage in lucid dreaming and i really
suggest that you try I myself have been
able to loose a dream on a few occasions
it usually happens when I have this
dream that I'm chewing glass for some
reason I'm able to realize that I
wouldn't chew glass in the real life and
it's at this point that i usually wake
up however some people have been able to
loose a dream such that they're able to
change the content and even fly away
that's really cool Susan I'm glad you
don't eat glass while you're awake
that's good but now that I have you here
why don't we move on to the drugs and
consciousness part of this lesson since
that is your area of expertise that
sounds great Lauren but first we have to
say or define what is a drug</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
