ship might look like let's say we have
some sort of a squarish style that has a
core and maybe a level one cache and
such tiles normally will be connected to
a shared bus now let's say that these
four cores are using half of the
available throughput on the bus because
their cache misses and coherence need to
be taken care of through the bus now
let's say we add another set of those
cores pretty much the same thing just
replicated now we have an even longer
that's possibly a slower bus that all
traffic from all these eight cores goes
to so we got a slower bus probably with
less throughput than the original small
one had yet it has twice the demand for
traffic so very quickly it will get
saturated now let's consider a type of
on chip network that is called a mesh so
here what we have is these quartiles are
individually connected like this for
example now there is no more broadcast
but this core can still send a message
to any other core if we send a message
to this this is the link that gets used
meanwhile this core could be sending a
message here if we need to send a
message from here to here then these two
links get used meanwhile we can get
these two links used independently so as
you can see the total available
throughput in the entire network is
several times the throughput of this
individual link and because it's a short
link we can have a very large throughput
now I'm going to take this 2x2 mesh and
copy it so that I get four of those and
create a four by four mesh that now
supports 16 cores twice as many as here
note how many new links are there now if
you have neighbor-to-neighbor
communication we can have these two
talking these two talking these two
talking all over independent links so as
I increase the number of cores
I also increase the number of these
links naturally so that the total
throughput available in this network
grows with the number of course so the
number of cores grows the number of
links grows
and that allows the available throughput
to grow and that means that I can have
many more cores than I could on the bus
there are many types of this so-called
point-to-point networks a mesh is one of
those that is very good for chip
building because none of these links
intersect each other
so because chips are basically made by
printing things on silicon it's
naturally good to have something that is
kind of flat like this and doesn't have
links going across different nodes but
we can build chips with some amount of
Link's crossing each other and thus we
can have a mesh which is kind of like
what we have seen we can have a torus
Network you build a torus by taking the
mesh and connecting the end points to
each other so the torus really takes the
link and kind of wraps it around and
then wraps it around and so on and then
you do that in the other dimension too
you can think of these processors as
basically things on a doughnut you would
take this wrap it around you get a
cylinder then you take the endpoints of
the cylinder bend it and create a
doughnut so that's why it's called a
torus but in reality what you really do
is you do this have a long link that
crosses here and the long link that
crosses here and so on and then you also
take this and create a long link that
goes here so that's how you create a
torus and then there are even fancier
networks that are still reasonably good
for on chip implementations such as flat
and butterfly if you're interested in
how this work a very good place to start
would be an advanced class on on chip
interconnects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
