through a scene we can walk or fly we
can look one direction while moving
another and so on here we're moving a
bit sideways in a bit forward while
looking forward I usually think of the
camera as being in one of two modes
fewer centric or model centric when
things are viewer centric the viewer is
moving around through the world when
model centric a particular object in a
world is being studied and the viewers
goal is to see this object from
different angles in this mode we keep
the camera focused on a location as we
move the place where we look is called
the target in three Jas and in other
systems note that this target location
is not at all necessary and making the
various matrices needed for viewing the
scene the target is much more related to
user intent because the target is such a
useful concept many but not all camera
control systems support the idea of a
target in some way to set the target we
use the camera controls target parameter
we've set this parameter before it
provides the point that our cameras
looking at so setting the view matrix by
setting the target in the camera
controls you not only set the cameras
view transform you keep the camera
pointed at this location when you orbit
if the object is moving you can update
the target each frame and the camera
will stay trained on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
