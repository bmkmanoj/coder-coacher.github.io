universal parser like this was that I
could fill in any context free grammar
and check any string of tokens against
it for example here I've defined a new
grammar that accepts the word prisoner
followed by a list of numbers so n is a
list of numbers it's at least one but
you can have more this is a recursive
rule so we can have as many as we want
and I've gotten lazy we've only put in 0
1 2 3 4 5 6 but I could go all the way
seven eight nine ten and one of my
favorite prisoners is number six let's
go see if this string prisoner 6 is
accepted by this grammar here the chart
is a bit bigger because we have a sort
of a separate state for each one of
these this makes us glad that the
computer is doing the memoization
instead of us doing it by hand but down
here at the end we accept by contrast if
I just have the word prisoner this
shouldn't work because this list
requires one or more integers and in
fact down here we can see that it is not
accepted let's do just one more of these
if there were another prisoner vying for
the affection of my heart I'd ask you to
bring me prisoner 24601 perhaps his time
is up and his paroles begun you know
what that means let's check and see if
the string is accepted by the language
of the grammar and here all the way down
at the end of the day we see that
prisoner 24601 famously Jean Valjean
from Victor Hugo's Lemmy's Arab nice
piece of French literature is accepted
by the language of this grammar but we
have a large number of chart states 5 4
3 2 1 0 to accept this string let's do
one more of these just to show off our
very arbitrary power now I've put in the
B grammar from before we know how this
one's supposed to work because we did it
out together on paper the input string
I've put in is a BBC and that string is
in the language of the grammar if I
forget one of the bees we expect it not
to be and when I forget one of the bees
it is not in the language of the grammar
and the real trick is basically that you
have done it this is enough of a parser
to be given a formal grammar for java
script or HTML and determine if a string
a webpage a program is in that language
this is very exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
