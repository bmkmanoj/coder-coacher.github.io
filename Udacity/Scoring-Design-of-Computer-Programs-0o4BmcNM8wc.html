so those each play is a triple a
physician a direction and a word and
then I could add a score to those but it
seems like i'm just taking these lists
apart and putting them back together so
many times i've already done it three
times i did the rope play its took it
apart added back in a J for the
horizontal place and took that apart
added back in a direction for all plays
I could do that one more time to insert
the score and maybe that would have been
the right choice maybe I just got
fatigued and I made a mistake in my
design sense but what I decided to do
was modify my horizontal plays and all
plays functions there's two
modifications so here in horizontal
plays after I've got the play i
calculate a score and then I insert that
into my result so now my results are no
longer just position word plays there a
score position where it play and then I
want to do the same thing in all place I
want to make my Play be a scorer
position direction word tuple and I'm
just as before ripping these things
apart putting them back together now
remember the board it's got these double
letters triple word scores and so on if
you're old school it looks like this
this is on a piece of cardboard that's a
physical material we've also written
triple and double scores so I've need to
come up with some ways of representing
these spots on the board and how they're
special now could I squeeze it into my
existing representation of a row so
remember a row is a list and it can have
things like the border is a string then
we have a letter then we can have
anchors like any could I have room for
putting in information about bonus
squares on the board the double and
triple letters could I have say free w
to mean a triple word score as an
element of this row I guess my intuition
is I don't think that's going to work
very well the problem is one of these
squares say this one could be both an
anchor and a triple word score and so I
need some representation that allowed
both of those and that just doesn't seem
to be easy to extend what I already have
let's not override our row notation our
rows as we have it I'm pretty happy
with them so I'm not going to allow this
I'm going to keep Rose exactly as they
are and i'm going to introduce another
data structure a parallel bored so i'm
going to have two boards one board that
i play on and another board that holds
the bonuses so think of it as two layers
one representation of a two-dimensional
matrix just holds these double words and
triple letter scores and so on and then
on top of that there's a second two
dimensional array that holds the values
of the letters and also holds the
anchors I got a good score now we're
going to have board at j i will hold the
letter or anchor and then bonus at j i
will hold corresponding bonus a double
word a triple letter or just nothing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
