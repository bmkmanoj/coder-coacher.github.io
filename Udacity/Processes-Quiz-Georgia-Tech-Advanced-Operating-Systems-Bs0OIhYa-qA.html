through to memory locations a and B and
both these memory locations have been
initialized to 0 and let's say that
there are two processes executing on two
different processors p1 and p2 and so a
and B C and D they're all shared memory
locations and let's say that process p1
is executing this piece of code
it's assigning a plus 1 to a B plus 1 to
B and there's another process p2 that is
using the values B and a and assigning
them to variables dnc now one thing that
you have to recognize is that the
process of P 1 and process P 2 are
working completely independently right
they are completely independent of each
other it is just that these memory
locations a B C and D are all shared
memory locations and but we have no way
of knowing the relative ordering of all
of these instructions that you are
seeing here when you think about a
uniprocessor program there is an
expectation that instructions are
textually the way they are ordered is
the order in which the processor is
executing but what we're looking at is
instructions that are happening on
different processors there's a set of
instructions here set of instructions
here all manipulating the same shared
memory so the question to you is what
possible values do you expect to see for
D and C do you expect that when let's
say that you know process p1 completes
process p2 completes we don't know what
order they execute it both have
completed execution at the end of that
would you expect to see C and D to be
equal to 0 C and D to be both equal to 1
C to be equal to 1 and D to be equal to
0
C to be equal to 0 and D to be equal to
1 ok basically I've given you all the
permutation combinations of the four
possibilities for the values that C and
D can assume given this set of
instructions there is happening
partially on p1 partially on p2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
