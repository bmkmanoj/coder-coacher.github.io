works real quick I've got this file
called fronts that HTML it's currently
blank I'm going to type in some HTML
we've got our doctype in our head our
title is /sq slash we've got our body
here and inside our body we've got an h1
tag which is just basically it's called
a header one it draws a new text bold a
little larger with a little margin
around it and that's it so that's in
this file called front HTML if we had
opened this in our browser it would just
print the words you know a skew between
slashes and let's go ahead and instead
of floating this in our browser return
it from our file here instead of calling
self dot right I've changed this to self
dot render front the HTML and let's give
this a whirl okay here we are in our
browser I've reloaded the page we can
see my title is set to slash ASCII and
we've got the text slash ASCII up here
the slashes is that's just a kind of a
joke that's how 4chan does their titles
and stuff in our editor you can see we
just called the self dot render function
which is defined here all that does is
it calls render stir on this template
name this file name which render stir
loads
renders and then we write ok so simple
enough that'll just save some time it's
a little bit more convenient to edit
HTML as HTML especially if your editor
is going to help you than to have a big
string in the middle of your Python file
all right let's go over to our HTML and
the first thing we want to add is our
form so the method is going to be post
and we're not going to define an action
we're just going to we're just going to
submit to ourselves which is something
we've done a lot so I've added one input
field we're gonna call it title and I'm
gonna clue title and a little dip here
just to put it on a new line and then
it's gonna be an input type text and
this is gonna be for the title of our
image let's go ahead and I I close the
form tag I'm gonna save the file and
that's loaded in our browser to make
sure everything's working ok Here I am
the browser and I reload and now I have
my title string and a sum a box I can
type in ok always well let's add the
next form field for inputting the art
from the user so
I call this art and let's interrupt this
for a quick quiz which is the most
appropriate form element for inputting
ASCII art is it input type text a text
area a pre element or input type
