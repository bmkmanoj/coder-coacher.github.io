can have its issues a perfect dataset
isn't typically available in the real
world not only do we have to get the
existing data set up so that it's usable
for analysis but we've also seen that
sometimes there are missing data and we
have to figure out what to do with them
either not use them or make something up
to fill these gaps
another issue that we'll explore in this
lesson is the fact that sometimes
certain records within the data just
don't seem to fit with the data set as a
whole if it's a numeric field there may
be numbers that seem extreme or way too
large or small compared to the other
values in that field if it's categorical
data
it might have a value that only appears
once out of a large set of data in
statistics the common term for this kind
of data is an outlier sometimes there
can be good reasons why this data looks
weird and sometimes it may be because
the data is just wrong in this lesson
we're going to cover how to recognize
when outliers are present understand how
they can affect your model and some
common methods for keeping that affect
to a minimum</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
