think of Galileo he taught us how to
describe motion mathematically he
discovered that all objects on earth
fall at a constant acceleration 10
meters per second squared and he knew
that a free falling objects distance
covered is proportional to x squared he
sort of answered the how of motion new
and on the other hand taught us that
it's forces that cause motion and he
represented that with an equation he
sort of answered the why of motion or at
least began to answer the why now
unfortunately Galileo died shortly after
Newton was born but you dasty has
recently uncovered a series of
time-traveling text messages between
Isaac Newton and Galileo Galilei we were
able to recover one screenshot from this
incredibly historic and terribly
anachronistic text conversation Newton
starts by thanking Galileo for giving
him some shoulders to stand on no
problems as Galileo wants to know why
Newton of course is getting a little
cocky Galileo's impressed Newton tells
move out F equals MA Galileo of course
immediately understands the consequences
and then Newton oh no we get cut off
there I guess we'll have to extrapolate
and figure the rest out ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
