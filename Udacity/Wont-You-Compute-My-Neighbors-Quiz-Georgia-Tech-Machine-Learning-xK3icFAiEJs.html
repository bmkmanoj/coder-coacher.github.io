okay yeah here's the first quiz and
here's the way it's set up I want you to
fill in the empty boxes of this table
okay ooh got it a lot of empty boxes a
lot of empty boxes okay but okay make
sure I understand what's going on here
so we're looking at three different
algorithms that are learning algorithms
there's what one neural net No
okay one nearest neighbor k nearest
neighbor and linear regression yep and
for each one you want to know running
time and space mm-hmm and this is on
endpoints I assume yeah and so and what
does it mean for data points to be
sorted so let's assume that we're living
in a world where all of our data points
are you know in r1 okay and yeah that
could be sorted and that you know we're
gonna be outputting some real number as
well so there points on a on a number
line so to make things simple for you
I'm gonna say that the points that
you're given are already sorted okay all
right and yeah that makes sense if it's
just a scalar so then a query point it's
gonna come in and it's gonna be some
value and we're gonna have to find
nearest neighbors or do linear
regression whatever right all right now
that's for running time for space you're
talking about the space of what how much
space you're gonna have to do in order
to accomplish your task time in space
you're gonna have to use in order to
accomplish your task so this is kind of
like the the space that's representing
the classifier or the regression after
training yes so I'd actually that
question of after training is important
so you'll notice that I've divided each
of these algorithms into two phases
there's the learning phase how much time
it takes to learn how much space you
need to learn and then there's the query
phase when I give you some new value and
you have to output an answer what's the
running time for that and what are the
space requirements for that okay you got
it and I want that for each one of these
three algorithms except for one nearest
neighbor which it appears as though
you've filled in for me to get me
started right so just to get you started
and make it easy for you to know what
I'm talking about I'm talking about Big
O times here right now I'm not gonna
make you write out Big O Big O is
implicit so if we look at one nearest
neighbor and we asked well what's the
running time of learning
well it's constant right because there's
no learning I see you just take that
sort of set of data points and
pass it along to the querier right now
you could say that well I'm gonna take
the data points and I'm gonna copy them
into this database and so it's linear
but let's assume they already come in a
database or some data structure that you
can use okay gotcha okay so now that
actually brings to a nice little
question but how much space learning
takes here and well because you have to
store those points and keep them around
the space requirements are Big O of n
yes okay good so given that as an
example do you think you're one example
in your database
mm-hm do you think you can use that to
build up labels for all the rest of the
phases of the different algorithms yeah
okay cool go for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
