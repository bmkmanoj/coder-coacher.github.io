different values in different contexts
is sometimes called scope there's some
sort of global scope that we start in
where we're assigning values to
variables but then inside my fund
there's a new X that has a new value and
what this means is that our environment
cannot be a flat mapping we had hoped
before that we'd be able to use a single
Python dictionary but this my fun
example shows that that's really not
going to cut it because in a single
dictionary you can only have X bind to
one thing and we need to know that X is
sometimes outside X and sometimes most
lucy attaced let's get some practice
with these concepts with another quiz
this one explicitly on scoping and we'll
do it together in the interpreter so we
have X gets outside x and y gets outside
y just like before so I've written out
this program and it's a little more
complicated than last time it has two
functions fun one and fun to my
phenomenal cosmic naming scheme with a
few printouts X starts out as outside X
Y starts out as outside y when we enter
function 1 we print out current value of
x in scope the current value of y in
scope and then we call function to
function two also prints out its value
of x and its value of y and down here we
get the ball rolling by calling function
one on Hong Kong in 1997 so the quiz for
you
is to fill in these blanks the three
formal parameter declarations two for
fun one and one for fun too but you can
only use x y&amp;amp;z so for each one of these
blanks fill it in with either X or Y or
Z and that's it in order to make the
output of this program match exactly
what we see down here fun 1x Hong Kong
fun 1y outside y fun 2 X outside X fun
2y fun 1y this is a bit of a puzzle try
it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
