workhorses of giant scale services any
modern data centers employees on the
order of thousands and thousands of
computational nodes connected by
high-performance high-speed networks it
is such computational clusters which are
serving as the workhorses for giant
scale services today and this figure
reproduced from Eric Brewers paper circa
2000 of nodes in a data center may be on
the order of a thousand but scale it up
by ten or a hundred in terms of today's
computational capacity that you might
find in a typical data center and the
kind of volume of queries that are going
to be handled by giant scale services
today each node in the cluster may
itself be an SMP there are several
virtues for structuring the
computational resources inside a data
center as a cluster of machines
connected by high-performance backplanes
the advantages include absolute
scalability you can keep adding more
resources without worrying about re
architecting the internals of the data
center cost and performance is another
important issue and that is by having
computational clusters where every node
is identical to others is that as a
system administrator we can control both
the cost and the performance of running
a data center like that and because
they're independent components you can
easily mix and match generational
changes in the hardware and there is
also incremental scalability you add
more resources you get more in terms of
performance because as I told you
earlier most of the queries that come
into a giant scale services tend to be
embarrassing ly parallel so the more
resources you've got the more queries
you can handle there is incremental
scalability when you're using clusters
because you can add more nodes to the
cluster increases the performance or if
the volume of requests come down you can
scale
that's the advantage of using
computational thrusters as the
workhorses for data centers that are
serving giant scale services today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
