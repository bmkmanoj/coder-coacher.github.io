see is that well this is the shortest
possible tour so these two here cannot
be true and also this one here cannot be
true because after all this is an
approximation and it is not guaranteed
to give us the optimum solution the
question now is which one of these two
here to choose so is it always strictly
smaller or can it be the same and the
correct answer here is that the length
of the shortest tour can actually also
be equal to the length of the tour
output by the algorithm it's not
guaranteed to be but it can be and this
could be the case for example if the
input that we were given is already a
tree then the spanning tree will just be
the input network itself so then a
shortest tour is indeed a walk along
that tree and so in this case you would
have equality here so length of the tour
that we compute is at least as large as
the length of the shortest tour but not
always strictly bigger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
