the user about which item they've chosen
in this case we haven't selected
anything yet so it as soon as we're
starving and tells us to pick something
if I pick something to eat like
strawberry pudding the message changes
to remind me which item I've selected
now how does backbone handle monitoring
events in a bjs we have a view for the
selected item message just like before
we get the template from the Dom convert
it to a string and pass it to
underscores template function these
buttons are part of a menu item view and
that's where the button and the selected
item message are wired together this is
where we set up the events for each menu
item when something with the class of
selected item is clicked JavaScript will
call the select item function which is
right here backbone creates a record of
all the events it needs to listen for it
keeps track of everything that needs to
happen when that event actually runs and
when the event occurs it triggers all
the code that needs to run we're going
to look at backbones on function in
isolation this way we can really focus
on how it works let's first create an
empty object now we'll take this empty
object and add in all of backbones event
functions since it has backbones on
method I can now set up an event for
this object to listen for finally I'll
trigger that event and pass it some data
backbone took this string and passed it
to the callback function and logged out
this message let's dive into on and see
how it's doing this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
