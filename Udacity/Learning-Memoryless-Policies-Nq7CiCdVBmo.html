model-based reinforcement learning in
Palm dp's and now we're going to talk a
little bit about model-free
reinforcement learning in Ponte piece
okay and in particular we're going to
focus on memoryless policies and what
I'd like to show actually it's not so
much about learning but more about
landing so here's a little pom DP this
is a pom TP that has four underlying
states two observations there's this
sort of clear blue thing and there's a
green thing to actions black and red
black takes you to the right and red
takes you to the left back around the
other way and the way that this is set
up it's kind of like a I think of it as
a one-dimensional hallway a hallway and
we don't know exactly where we are in
the hallway but we're trying to get to
something you know say my office along
the hallway if we're to the left of my
hallway we should go right to go to my
office but if we just keep going left
and left and left and left and left
we're just going to go and get stuck in
it's an infinitely long hallway or it
feels like an infinitely long I we're
just going to get stuck at the end
whereas if we're to the right of my
office and we go to the right we also
kind of get stuck we need to go to the
left to get where we're going once we
actually get to the office we have a
reset action the black action resets us
with equal probability to one of those
three states because I don't know we're
drunk and then we get to go again try
and get back to the office ok this is
reasonable good first I want to point
out I think we talked about an example
just like this before and we said that
probably the right thing to do is to go
like left right right that sort of thing
because each time we reset we're in one
of these states which what we go left
hoping that it's going to take us out of
here but that doesn't seem to work so we
go right to take us from this side back
out actually right right left is
probably even better just keep doing
this over and over and over again all
right but now what we're talking about
our memoryless policies a memoryless
policy has the form when you're in the
green state well there's only one action
choice so you take it when you're in the
clear blue state you have to go either
left or right or maybe you can choose
probabilistically among left and right
but you can't you can't do these
sequences because it's memoryless you
need memory to do a sequence right
that's a problem ok I see I see I see
whether the problem or you could just
invent memory palm dp's do invent memory
if you're going to learn the palm DP
model of this it captures the memory
that you need to actually make optimal
decisions all right fair enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
