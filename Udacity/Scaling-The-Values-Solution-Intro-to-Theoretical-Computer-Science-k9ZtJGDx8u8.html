of n times V since very was this value
here and now since we scaled it down
using this factor here what we now have
to do is we have to replace v by v over
v over n times 1 minus c which is the
same as 0 of n squared times 1 over 1
minus c which is the same as this one
here now of course in order to be very
correct here we have two constraints e
so that it cannot become one otherwise
this running time here would be
undefined but that's okay as you'll soon
see that actually makes quite a lot of
sense so you have seen that we now have
made the running time independent of V
and that is of course a very cool thing
because V originally was what could make
this algorithm run in exponential time
and now we can use this factor 1 minus C
here to control the running time so the
running time will of course again become
exponential if C becomes very close to
one but it will be polynomial if for
example we set C 20 and something in
between when we set C to other values
now I still haven't told you what the
see here is going to be about but Wilson
figure that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
