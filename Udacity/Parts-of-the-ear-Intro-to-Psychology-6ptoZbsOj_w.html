you tell me what this is yeah Andy it's
an ear okay it is and can you tell me
what happens when a sound wave comes and
enters our ear well I'm guessing it's
collected by this tube thing here right
exactly and that tube thing is called
the ear canal and then what do you think
happens then it gets to this thing here
that's right and this thing is called
the eardrum and it's a tight membrane
that vibrates the same frequency is this
incoming sound wave that's really cool
Andy but then what are these things
that's connected to the eardrum ah these
are three tiny bones so the vibrations
in the eardrum cause these bones to
vibrate but you will then what happens
when the vibrations get to this curly
thing here right this curly snake-like
looking thing is called the cochlea and
the cochlea is filled with fluid so when
the bones here vibrate they actually
cause the fluid in the cochlea to
vibrate as well okay so we have
vibrating air which goes in to vibrate
the eardrum which vibrates the bones
which vibrates the fluid in the cochlea
exactly and lining the inside of this
cochlea are thousands of tiny little
hairs and when these hairs vibrate they
cause neurons to fire the signal gets
sent off to part of the brain called the
temporal lobe which is where it's
interpreted a sound something else
that's amazing is that the different
frequencies will actually cause
different hairs in the cochlea to
vibrate which is part of how we're able
to hear so many different sounds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
