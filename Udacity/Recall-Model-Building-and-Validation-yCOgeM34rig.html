quantity that is called recall the
recoil is the number of true positives
divided by the number of true positives
plus false negatives let's quickly look
at our confusion matrix again in this
case we are taking the true positives
and dividing by the sum of true
positives and false negatives if you
remember the definition of sensitivity
you will see that recall is the same
quantity as sensitivity the reason we
have two different names for the same
quantity is a consequence of how the
entire field of model building was
developed through many different fields
and disciplines and only recently we are
beginning to consolidate the terminology
so usually if you look at statistics
books you will see the terminology of
sensitivity while if you look at a
machine learning book you will probably
find the word recall also when we are
comparing with specificity we tend to
use the word sensitivity when we are
comparing with precision we try to use
the word recall mathematically they are
the same quantity also remember as we
varied our threshold we had different
values of sensitivity and specificity in
the same way we can get different values
of precision and recall by changing our
threshold or cut the resulting curve is
very similar to our ROC curves in this
case these curves are called precision
recall curves let's go back to our
ipython notebook we had already built
our models and we had received some
accuracy numbers for the given
classifies let's look at this piece of
code when we run this piece of code you
will get the following table now we have
the same kind of confusion matrix that
we had before let's look at the next
piece of code here we are using this
method of plot precision recall curve to
plot a precision recall curve we're
using the psychic learns method
to actually calculate the values of
precision recall for every cut let's run
this piece of code now the next line
should actually draw the curves for you
if everything runs properly you should
get a curve that looks like this in this
case the recall has been plotted on the
x-axis and the precision on the y-axis
remember the values of both range from 0
to 1 in this case the logistic
regression the random forest classifier
and the support vector classifiers are
shown in blue green and red respectively
we have also calculated the area under
the curve for each of these precision
recall curves this gives us an average
measure of performance for these
classifiers it is often useful to use
the PR plot if we are interested in the
proportion of positive outcomes over the
negative ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
