it as a state of balance and by balance
I mean well balanced forces before we
get too deep into a definition let's
talk about some examples for example
let's consider a ball and a well if I
release this ball from right here well
we all know what's going to happen it's
going to roll back and forth and
eventually it's gonna settle in one spot
a place where it settles somewhere near
here is its equilibrium if you disturb
the ball from its equilibrium say by
shifting it a bit to the right well now
it's on a hill and we could do some
force decomposition and we would see
that there's actually a force pointing
down the hill it's going to tend to
restore this object back towards
equilibrium and this is such an
important concept they give it its own
sentence here but from being specific I
should change the title to stable
equilibrium this idea that when
disturbed the adjectives are try to
return to equilibrium that's
characteristic of what's known as stable
there's also semi stable and unstable
equilibrium but we're not going to talk
about those today because this is the
sort of equilibrium that gives you the
simple harmonic motion we need for our
chronometer there's lots of other
systems that have this exact same
property for example if you have a mass
hanging from a spring well it's default
stay is just hanging in equilibrium but
if I pull the mass down the spring will
exert a force back upwards which tends
to restore it to equilibrium
likewise with a pendulum or a mass
swinging from a rod it's default state
its equilibrium is vertical if we
displace it from vertical there will be
some component of force in this case
gravity which tends to restore it
there's one more key point for a simple
harmonic motion a criteria that must be
fulfilled if we're going to get the
isochronous periodicity that we want and
this one I want you to complete for me
so looking at you could look at these
for example as I move this ball further
and further up the hill further from
equilibrium does the force tending to
push it back increase decrease or stay
the same
