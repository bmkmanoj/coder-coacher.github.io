candidate mark did pretty well he asked
a lot of clarifying questions asking the
the clarifying questions like really
trying to understand the problem a lot
of times as an interviewer you you have
an idea of where you want him to go but
getting him to that point is his
responsibility he has to ask those
questions to get himself there I think
he also did a really good job of
following my lead like when I was trying
to get him somewhere of actually like
listening to the feedback that he was
given and and going down those roads
yeah so I think a little more whiteboard
practice would have helped him out you
tend to want to start in the top left of
the board that way you have plenty of
room to write you want to make sure that
you leave space between lines because
you're always going to have to go back
and add lines in the middle and then
there were opportunities where he would
close out a tag and then he'd have to
erase it and move that that closing down
further and further as we progress
through the problem so I would say give
yourself more space for writing and
don't close the tag until you're done so
the teach me something in five-minute
question I really like that one because
as an engineer you're constantly having
to teach your fellow engineers there's
not an engineer on the face of the earth
that knows everything about everything
so they're constantly helping each other
and teaching someone something they
don't know in five minutes is actually a
really important part of the job that
you'll do numerous times per day so I
asked about what interested him in web
development and what he was excited
about coming down in the future and
that's a question looking for passion
and drive this is a career field that's
constantly changing and if someone's not
passionate about the field or the
product itself they're not going to
remain on the cutting edge so it's a
question designed to determine if
they're going to be someone that will
stay educated and remain at the cutting
edge the whole time there with your
company so the question about the
palindrome is a pretty typical
programming question you'll receive the
interviewer is not too interested in
whether you can actually solve the
problem they just want to see if you can
think like a programmer and if you
understand the basic syntax rules
the language being used so the image
carousel question is another basic
programming question that's just trying
it's pretty simple so we're just trying
to get the candidate warmed up at that
point and get used to writing on the
board and once again we're just trying
to see if they think like a developer
would within the role they'll be
fulfilled so the question on closures is
actually the the one question that i was
actually testing the candidates
understanding of the language on it gets
pretty low level and we asked some deep
questions that really let me know
whether the candidate knows what's going
on when they're writing code so the
question about the technical challenge
and how did you solve it that's kind of
a cool down question coming off of the
whiteboard and just lets me understand
some of the things that the candidate
has challenged themselves with and how
do they approach that problem and their
problem-solving ability and I really
want to see the candidate like get
through a complicated problem and not
say like well I had this problem and I
just gave up or I asked I went ask
someone for help overall tone was good I
probably could have slowed down a little
bit and fought about the response to a
question a little more before answering
it particularly there were moments where
it felt like the candidate was going on
and on and on a little bit and they
probably could have just wrapped it up
quicker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
