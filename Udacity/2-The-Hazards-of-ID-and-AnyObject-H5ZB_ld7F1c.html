statically typed language it sneaks in
more flexibility in typing through the
use of the type ID ID as you'll remember
is like saying to be determined or this
object can be of any type at runtime a
more specific type is determined
delegates generally have type ID as well
as objects inside of arrays when Swift
is consuming objective-c code objects of
type ID or given the type any object an
object of type any object can hold a
variety of types although your code may
work if you allow objects of type ID to
be imported as objects of type any
object it's not really in the spirit of
Swift development to allow for such
flexible types not to mention any object
can leave you vulnerable to unrecognized
selector errors when you're dealing with
untyped arrays let's take a look at an
example here's a backpack class written
in objective-c and you can see it has a
property called keys which holds an NS
mutable array this example project also
has a class called key which implements
the method open door here's some swift
code that's using the backpack class
first we instantiate a backpack
instantiate a key to represent our house
key and then add that key to the
backpack so far so good now let's take
the key out of the backpack and try to
open the door the code above compiles
fine but when we press run we've got a
problem so let's go down to the console
and see if we can see what's going on we
have to scroll up to the top ok what
have we got unrecognized selector sent
to instance and a bunch of numbers
what's this about a string if we look
again at the backpack class we can see
ok the first object in the array is an
API key so it doesn't implement the
method open door open door is the
unrecognized selector</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
