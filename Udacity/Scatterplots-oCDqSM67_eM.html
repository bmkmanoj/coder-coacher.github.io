another way to visualize the differences
between daily returns of individual
stocks let's get back again to our daily
return chart we've got S&amp;amp;P 500 here
plotted already and let's compare that
to another stock XYZ now note here that
frequently XYZ moves in the same
direction as SP Y but it also sometimes
moves a little bit further like in these
sections here we'll be able to visualize
those differences in a scatter plot so
on a scatter plot there are number of
individual points or dots and each one
represents something that happened on a
particular day
so let's look at this particular day on
this day SP y was positive close to plus
1 so we'll look at plus 1 on SP y and
XYZ was about plus 1 as well but a
little bit larger so that day would
correspond to a point about there now we
look at each day one by one individually
and populate all of our dots based on
what happened each day another
interesting day is this one where SP y
and X Y Z were moving in different
directions so again we had s py and
positive territory but X Y Z was in
negative territory so that would
represent a dot about like that now if
we were to continue this process for
very many days over a long period of
time for most stocks a trend appears
which is something like this where you
can sort of see there's a relationship
here maybe a linear relationship and
however the dots are somewhat scattered
they don't form a perfect line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
