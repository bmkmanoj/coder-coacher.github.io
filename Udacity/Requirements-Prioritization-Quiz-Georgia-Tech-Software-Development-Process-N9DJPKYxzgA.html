prioritization let's try to see how this
might work in practice imagine that you
have collected the following set of five
requirements for an ATM system but only
have resources to satisfy two of them
possibly three I would like for you to
look at this list and suitably
prioritize the requirements by marking
them as mandatory in this case you're
gonna put an M in this space nice to
have this case you're gonna put an N or
superfluous in this case you're gonna
put an S this is the set of requirements
the first one says that the system shall
check the pin of the ATM card before
allowing the customer to perform an
operation the second says that the
system should perform an additional
biometric verification of the customer
identity for example a check of the
customer's fingerprints before it allows
the customer to perform an operation
then we have that the system shall allow
customers to withdraw cash using an ATM
card the system shall allow customers to
deposit money using an ATM card and the
system shall allow customers to change
the pin of the righty M card so again
mark those as mandatory nice-to-have or
superfluous considering the fact that
you can satisfy only two possibly three
of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
