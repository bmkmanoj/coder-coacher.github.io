about is what I cut is what I'm going to
call a null space transformation and
this is where we take a random test case
or any test case of course and we make
some sort of a change to it that
shouldn't affect how its treated by the
software under test and so one thing we
could do just as a trivial example
because we can start with a simple
Python function this is the input to the
most base transformation so here we have
few of a and B returns the sum of a and
B and one possible null space
transformation on this would be to add a
level of parenthesis or maybe several
now this is the null space
transformation because we've transformed
a test case possibly in a non-trivial
way although here we've done something
pretty trivial but we've transformed it
in such a way that we know that the
meaning of the test case shouldn't have
changed so now we can do something very
much like differential testing instead
of taking the same program and writing
it through two implementations of Python
we're going to take two programs which
are semantically identical and run it
through the same implementation of
Python and if that implementation of
Python treats this differently that is
to say it interprets this code in such a
way that it returns some different
answer then we found a bug in it so of
course we could always make do things
even more elaborate so here we're
calling some sort of an identity
function on a that is to say some
function that is guaranteed to return
the same value a that it's called with
all those of course that's not going to
be apparent to the interpreter and then
instead of adding b2a we're going to
subtract minus B for me so another
little no space transformation and
afraid of these kind of things and so I
don't have any personal experience using
null space transformations to find bugs
but I've heard of people doing this kind
of thing and apparently it can be useful
so what have we done here what we've
done is seen that in realistic
situations there are a lot of potential
Oracle's available for performing random
testing and so the conventional wisdom
at least as expressed in that article or
that chapter on random testing that
Oracle's are almost never available I
think is probably not right it's often
the case that if we think about it for a
while if we're potentially willing to
invest some time and creating a go to
Oracle then we can very often find
something to use for random testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
