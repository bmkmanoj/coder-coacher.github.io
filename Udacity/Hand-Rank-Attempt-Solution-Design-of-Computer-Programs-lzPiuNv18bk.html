get some of the cases right in fact we
get many cases right we get all the test
cases that we've seen so far correct
because in each one of those we can
distinguish between two hands just by a
single number we can distinguish that a
full house is better than straight just
because looking at the numbers that get
returned for a full house who would
return a six and for a straight would be
returned to four and we know a six is
greater than four and so max would do
its job and would give us the right
answer but it wouldn't do give us the
right answer in all cases so for example
what happens if somebody had a pair of
10s and three other cards and another
player had a pair of nines and three
other cards with what we had written so
far pay our turns out to be ranking
number one and so the hand rank for this
would be equal to one in the hand rank
for this would be equal to one and those
would be the same and it wouldn't be
able to choose between them but we know
that we want the pair of tens to outrank
the pair of nines so we got to come up
with some way to make that comparison so
that we're able to distinguish between
two rankings that are the same in terms
of their what they're called they're
both called pairs but they different in
what they are a pair of tens versus a
pair of nines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
