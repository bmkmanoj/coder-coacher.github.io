little bit more programming oriented
questions so I actually wanted to start
you off with a sequel question okay
let's say we have this table and maybe I
should write it under if you want to
write it but uh yeah prefer to say you
have a table and let's say what's called
cars and this table is going to have
several rows the first one is going to
be an ID which is which is just an
integer the second one is going to be a
make of the bottle vehicle which is
really a character okay or a set of
characters right so the next one is
going to be the model of the vehicle
mm-hmm character as well do you mean
like a string a string yeah remember
yeah and next will be how many cylinders
this is Rico half FFA that's an integer
and lastly the horsepower for the car
it is also an integer yeah so so what I
would like you to do is to write a
sequel query that will give me the three
vehicles with the highest number of
horsepower that have more than six
cylinders in them okay let me let me say
say that again so I can write it down
the three the three vehicles vehicles
that have the highest horsepower highest
horsepower okay but at least six
cylinders
okay
okay so I'm assuming that in my table I
could have I guess what I'm wondering is
like are we talking about vehicles as in
like with with separate ID or are we
thinking about types of vehicle like
maker model could there be more than one
car with the same make and model and
presumably the same number of cylinders
and horsepower no no it'll be different
yeah okay okay just information about
each make a model okay okay so like this
would be specified by like make a model
yeah
yes exactly okay cool right
okay so hmm
this I'm I need to write out the query
but I'm trying to think of the best
order so let me think through what I
need to do so this three will be a limit
three that will probably be the last
thing in my query
okay I'll be selecting make and model
from cars where there are like number of
cylinders is greater than or equal to
six and order by horsepower and I guess
I'll need to figure out they'll have to
be desk descending okay so yeah now I
need to put that all together yeah
that's perfect
okay so select
make model from
cars where number of cylinders is
greater than or equal to six and then
I'm going to order by horsepower
descending and then limit three
semicolon I've run into that problem
before so I think that probably does it
will return a table make model from cars
hire the cylinders order by the
horsepower we want the highest three
limit three yeah sounds excellent
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
