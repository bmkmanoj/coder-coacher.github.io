learn language easily from our verbal
communities and it is easy to overlook
the revolutionary affect the human
language has had in our evolution and
development as a species as well as our
ability to communicate and pass on
knowledge from generation to generation
there is a regular sequence in which we
acquire language beginning with cooing
then babbling one word utterances and
finally by age three we speak in
grammatical sentences the case study of
Jeanne demonstrates that there are
critical periods for acquiring language
and after that window of opportunity
language acquisition is very difficult
we also discussed an important principle
of science and that not all scientists
always agree on explanations and
theories in particular we saw how
Skinner and Chomsky had different
explanations for language a behaviorist
view or a nativist view we covered the
psychology of thought and cognition and
discuss how we represent ideas both
visually and verbally and use concepts
categories and hierarchies to organize
our thoughts and to understand our world
we discuss different kinds of reasoning
deductive and inductive and how critical
thinking can make us better consumers of
information and ideas finally we
demonstrated how we use mental shortcuts
or heuristics and making decisions and
how those can help but sometimes bias
our decision making</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
