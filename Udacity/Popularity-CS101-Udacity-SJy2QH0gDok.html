middle school and some of the people are
popular some of them might not be the
first step to deciding who's popular is
looking at who has a lot of friends so
let's draw in some links that show who's
a friend and friendship with links are
one directional just because alice's
friends with Bob doesn't mean that Bob
is friends with Alice so we'll draw our
links as arrows so this means this
person will call him Bob his friends
with Alice and let's say Alice has many
friends and let's say Bob is also
friends with this person they're friends
with each other we have lots of
friendship links some of them are
bi-directional but not all of them so we
have lots of friendships so is this
enough to decide who's popular so if you
went to a school like I did it's not
just having a lot of friends is not
enough to make you popular you have to
have the right friends you have to be
friends with the popular people so it's
not enough to have lots of geeky friends
say in high school you've got to have
lots of friends that are popular so that
means that the definition of popular
isn't just about having lots of friends
it's about having lots of friends who
also have lots of friends that's what
makes someone popular so we could define
popularity of a person is the number of
people who are friends with P this means
the number of links from someone else to
that person is their popularity score so
here's Charlie so there are 1 2 3 links
into Charlie so Charlie's popularity
score would be 3 Alice also has three
links so her popularity score would also
be three Bob only has one arrow going to
Bob so his popularity score would be one
so this isn't a bad way to define
popularity but it's not quite right so
the definition of popularity doesn't
just depend on the number of friends you
have it depends on both the number and
the popularity of your friends so we can
change the definition let's instead
define the popularity score of a person
T now it's going to be the sum of the
popularity of all their friends
so we can write that in a mathematical
way so using the Sigma means to sum up
we're going to take each friend that is
in the friends of P and we're going to
sum up the popularity score of the
friends if the mathematical notation is
unfamiliar to you we could also write
this as pseudo Python code we're
thinking of the popularity of a person p
let's assume we have a function that
gives us the friends so we're going to
start with the score is zero we're going
to loop through the friends and for each
friend we're going to add to peace corps
the popularity score of the friend and
will return the score as the result so
now you've seen a mathematical
definition of popularity you've seen the
same thing as code I'm going to ask you
a very important quiz question next it's
an easy one to get right if you try
twice because there's only two answers
but think about it carefully see if you
can get it right the first time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
