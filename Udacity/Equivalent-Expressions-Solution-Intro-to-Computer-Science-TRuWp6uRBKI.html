third are equivalent this is a little
surprising this was kind of a tricky
question so the reason the first one is
not if X is 7 or greater
well then 7 mod 7 has the value 0 that's
not the same as the X that we started
with and that's the case also if we have
8 8 modulo 7 it has the value 1 which is
different from what we started with when
the modulo is greater than the possible
value of X and we said X could be only
between 0 and 10 well then the result is
always the same as X the third question
when we map X 2 its character value and
then we take the order of that well char
and order inverses so that's equivalent
you would think that would work in the
other direction and the reason it
doesn't is because the input to Ord must
be a one letter string if the inputs not
a single character then Ord produces an
error so let's see that in the Python
interpreter if we print the result of
Ord where the input is a number and we
said X was the number of genes 0 and 3
well that gives us an error and it gives
it an error because or it expects a
string of length 1 but the input was an
integer there is a function that allows
us to turn numbers into strings and
that's the STR function that takes a
number and gives us a string
corresponding that number so let's see
what STR a3 gives us that will give us
the string 3 we can't see in the output
here that is actually a string but it is
a string and we can actually use order
on the result there when we run this
what we get is 51 not the 3 that we
passed in and that's because the Ord of
the character 3 is 51</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
