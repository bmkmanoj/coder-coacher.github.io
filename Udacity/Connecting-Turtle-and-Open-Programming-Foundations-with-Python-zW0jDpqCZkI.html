that the function open returns an object
of the file type now this word object is
really interesting because we've seen it
before I remember the time when we were
drawing squares using the class turtle
we were writing lines of code like this
this meant that Brad was an object or
instance of the class turtle similarly
when we write lines like this which is
codes equal to open file location' and
the file in our case was a movie codes
file we are saying that Coates is an
object or an instance of file now let's
think for a moment what happens when we
run this line of code when we do run
this line of code a function called init
is called from inside the class turtle
and what that does is that it creates
space and memory for the object Brad now
in the case of open even though on
surface it looks like we are merely
calling a function and that there is no
class involved if we look deep down
inside the code for how open was
actually implemented inside Python we
will find that open in turn is calling
some in it like function to create an
object of file all right that's enough
jargon for now we will talk about
instances and objects a little bit later
in the course for now we can rejoice in
the fact that part one of profanity
checker is done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
