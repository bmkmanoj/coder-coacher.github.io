coffee break in these weekly videos we
want to give you some insight into what
goes on here at Udacity and also share
some of the cool people that we get to
meet and last week we film a bunch of
interviews for the introduction to
programming class that's coming up and
we named Molly she had a really cool
story to tell and we hope her story
inspire you just I should inspire us so
I check you out so the first time I ever
used an API in a project was when I took
i phone programming it was Fall Quarter
my sophomore year and I just got an
iPhone I was really excited to learn how
to develop for it so we had an example
in class that loaded Flickr data from
the surrounding location and showed all
of these awesome pictures and that was
awesome for learning how to load images
in the background but I was excited to
learn how to do my own API call so when
I made my final project I loaded all of
the Yelp locations in a certain area
that would include food for someone who
was gluten-free or didn't eat meat or
only a kosher to try and cater to their
needs and that was really cool to go to
a website and find this call and be like
alright I'm going to get this data from
this website and parse it all by myself
and figure out what information is there
and linked to that site and it was it
was a very confidence-building moment
where I was like I can do this without
having someone hand me the data that I
need to use I can just go find that data
on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
