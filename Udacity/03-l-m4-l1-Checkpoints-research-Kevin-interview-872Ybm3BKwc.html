a graduate of the front-end nanodegree
program and he is now a front-end
engineer here at you'd ask you so Kevin
I wanted you to maybe talk to our
students about what you do when you are
learning in your technology where do you
go what sort of resources do you find
helpful yeah sure so I guess that's one
of the skills that I picked up from the
nanodegree is when you're trying to
learn something new I usually go right
to the official documentation or
official site that they whatever the
technology has set up be good nowadays
about giving you a little tutorial code
example and like good documentation
because like basically there's so many
new things coming out that if you don't
provide good documentation nobody's
going to use your technology so that's
like the best place to start and just
get some kind of a feel for it and then
obviously you're gonna have questions or
I always do so then that's when you can
go to like the Udacity forums you can go
to stack overflow just Google things but
usually I like to jump as quickly as
possible into a project so just it can
be a simple to-do app everybody does
those or like a Udacity project that's a
great starting point to and just kind of
go the like trying to actually build
something that's where you'll start to
have questions and you're kind of forced
to learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
