exact strings like slash about or slash
rolled I which are definitely useful but
in most web apps those types of routes
won't be the only tool in your arsenal
to illustrate why let's take a look at
reddit com reddit is divided into
thousands of different subreddits each
of which has a unique name like news or
gaming to visit my favorite subreddit
soccer we need to request reddit com / r
/ soccer to visit another subreddit like
puppies we need to request reddit com /
r / puppies with what we've seen so far
we could define the subreddit routes
individually in a Sinatra app like this
get / r / soccer do / r / cats / r /
photography and so on and that works
great if we only have a couple of
subreddits but of course reddit has
thousands and thousands of different
subreddits that we can visit as of this
recording reddit has over eight hundred
and seventy two thousand different
unique subreddits that you can browse
and simple three line route definitions
for that many subreddits would require
over 2.6 million lines of Sinatra code
which is just insane and that's just one
example assuming the simplest possible
route definitions take a look at the
path for an individual reddit post page
so this is the URL for a user's post
about her adorable kitten who just had
her first birthday and this was posted
to the cats subreddit so the URL is r /
cats / comments / 4 n 0 f 3 4 which is a
unique identifier for the individual
post here and then part of the title my
kitty just had her first birthday where
the spaces have been replaced with
underscores so it's a pretty complex and
long URL and there's no way that we
could define one of these routes in a
sinatra file for
every single post billions and billions
of posts on reddit com just thinking
about writing those wraps gives me a
headache instead we can define routes
that will match general patterns in
strength almost like having a variable
in our route so returning to the
subreddit examples rather than
explicitly defining routes for our /
soccer and our / photography it would be
much easier to define a route for our /
any subreddit named after that / so it
would be a catch-all route for anything
that started with our / and then any
possible subreddit name that came after
now to be clear this isn't the exact
syntax that we need to do that because
this route will just match the exact
string r / subreddit name likewise for
the individual reddit post pages rather
than explicitly defining a route / r /
cats / comments so as for end 0f 34 / my
kitty just had her first birthday we
might want to define a pattern route
like this r / some subreddit name
followed by a post ID followed by a post
title fortunately for us sinatra has a
very very simple syntax for defining
these types of dynamic reps these routes
that have path variable zin them and it
all comes down to one magic symbol the
colon nope not that colon the
grammatical colon there we go so next up
we'll see how we define those routes in
a Sinatra app using this magical colon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
