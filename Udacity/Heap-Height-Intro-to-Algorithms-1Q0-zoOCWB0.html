bunch of values that actually is a bunch
of values arranged in a kind of a graph
specifically it's a balanced binary tree
and each of the nodes has a value in it
and they for the heap property to be
satisfied the value in a node has to be
in every node in the tree has to be no
bigger than the values in the children
so let me show you an example so here's
a balanced binary tree with 20 nodes and
I'm gonna fill values in here that
satisfy the heap property and now I
filled in the nodes of the tree in with
values that's in a way that satisfies
the heap property and so this is an
interesting property so if you read left
to right top to bottom
13:24 2130 29 27 it's not really sorted
right the numbers kind of go up and down
the last number reading across is 41 but
if you read down paths there's all
sorted lists 13 24 30 50 874 13 21 sep
27 43 and that's because as we're going
down the tree the parent value is never
bigger than the value of the child
that's the heap property so what that
causes is that as we traverse down the
tree we're always traversing down a
sorted list so because of the properties
of the way that heaps are defined they
have some higher-level properties that
are going to turn out to be really
important in when they're used in
algorithms so the way that we created
nodes here is we filled them in left to
right top to bottom until we run out of
nodes and given that that's how we do it
what is the height from the root of the
tree the tippy top down to the deepest
leaf how long are the the longest paths
in this heap is it there constant depth
square root depth logarithmic depth or
as bad as linear depth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
