say one we talked about epsilon
photography sequence of images allowed
us to now capture more additional
representation that will allow us to
generate newer images we basically said
let's look at coated photography that is
within the same image captured let's put
some sort of additional information in
there that could be done by a coded
aperture or coded shutter and that allow
us to create for example two different
types of images we looked at coded
aperture in detail we looked at flutter
shutter or which was coded shutter and
basically all of them are examples of
how we can actually do coated
photography again epsilon photography
coated photography just kinds of similar
things in different ways but all aimed
at generating novel images on the camera
by controlling how the camera captures
the light from the scene and in essence
our major parts of what we think
computational photography should be
looking more and more at you'll be
learning more about these things in
other ways throughout the class with
some additional papers that I'm going to
be pointing you out to to finish here is
the paper that actually gets into the
whole concept of epsilon 2 coated
photography then the paper that i talked
about coated apertures this is the paper
what flutter shorter cameras just if
you're interested in the Lucy Richardson
Devore convolution methods there is a
Wikipedia entry on it that's pretty good
and again for those of you interested in
learning more about the digit lead
Fourier transform and the sinc functions
for different types of signals there's
an online book that has a lot of
information all right but otherwise find
your favorite textbook on digital
processing or image processing they'll
tell you how to do these things just
again I've also linked the websites of
the different projects that I've talked
about in this class I encourage you to
look at them there's a whole lot of
additional detail available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
