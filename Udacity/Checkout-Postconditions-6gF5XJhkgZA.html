is usually the case the preconditions
are easier than the post conditions so
we want to next look at what it means
assuming that we pass the preconditions
to actually check something out what
effect is that going to have on our
information system okay so take a minute
and think what you expect to happen when
the item is checked out and lists list
them in English ok so the I think my mom
what is the obvious post condition is
now the book is checked out so a way to
say that or express that I feel like we
can go back to that items currently
checked out operation that belongs to
the patron class and say that the set
that's returned from that operation
should contain this new loanable item
that's been checked out so this this
raises an interesting interesting issue
so we're specifying an operation and
we're specifying one operation in terms
of another operation ok and we can do
that that's fine however the real change
of state here has to do so the items
currently checked out it's a query
operation that reflects the state we
could more directly say what's the
change in the state ok so what other
post condition to you you have so the
other condition i have i think is more
related to this I guess is that a check
out we have that class represented our
UML diagram there has to be an instance
of that now for this particular
operation has just occurred so okay so
we have the association class checked
out yes and the effect of checking out
something new would mean that there's
another link in that association class
yes instance of that and if there is
another link there then by implication
the items currently checked out will
return that new item correct so we don't
have to state both of those okay we only
have to say that the the Association has
one
more thing in it and we get the other
one for free however there's another
post condition recall the business about
requests okay so what would be the
postcondition there be so the request
queue is now one less than it was prior
does you know someone has such it popped
off the queue because they check out
operation has occurred well it better be
you right okay because you're doing the
checking out we can't just get rid of an
arbitrary person that the implied patron
should be the one who's right ok so in
we already have a precondition which
says that this particular patron is
eligible because either there's no
request in which case there's nothing to
pop off or if there is a requests out
there the first one on the list had
better be you so in that latter
contingency we do want to pop off your
name okay from there so we're going to
state the post condition but it's going
to be a little tricky to state because
it's only in the case where you were on
the list right and that sounds like an
implication because we just had like
another only if the case if it's a child
this happens only if the case that you
were the patron on the checkout request
list bingo okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
