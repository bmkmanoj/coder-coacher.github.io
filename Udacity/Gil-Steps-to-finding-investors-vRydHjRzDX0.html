investor is is not an easy one
I think it will begins and understanding
who are the investors that are going to
be attracted to what you do so for
example you can go out and find
investors that like your domain they
have invested in companies in your space
not in a competitive yours but in your
type of technology or business and
perhaps they would have the propensity
and the interest to invest in you
so making out that list you can search
on Angeles and crunchbase and other debt
free data set the data sources out there
to find those investors that would be
number one number two is I think people
that perhaps you have come you know
throughout your career perhaps working
in an early stage startup and you an
early employee and maybe there's an
investor that invested in that company
maybe it had those are investors that
invested in your friends right people
that actually can look at you and know
that what you've done before this dollar
is something quite amazing and they
might want to invest in you going
forward because of who you are because
they believe in you
so looking at investors in your domain
looking at investors that share the same
path career paths with you or investing
starts to work with and then reaching
out to investors that maybe your friends
know that invested in their businesses
that your friends can vouch for you when
they make the introduction to those
investors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
