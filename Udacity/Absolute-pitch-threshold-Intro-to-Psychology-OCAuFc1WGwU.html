Hertz right now Andy yeah and it looks
like they're all able to hear that
Lauren what can we expect to start to
see contestants to drop off well the
range for human hearing is between 20
Hertz and 20,000 Hertz so if I had to
put my money on it
I would guess we'd see people drop off
at around 17 to 18,000 Hertz and for
those of you trying to compete at home
I'd recommend turning your sound up
closing your eyes and trying to see
which of these tones you can identify
you
you
that was really exciting Annie it was
let's see if we can talk to the winner
as they prepare for the next event
Susan are you there hi Andi I can hear
you loud and clear
you must be talking between 20 and
20,000 Hertz right I've got the winner
here of the pitch absolute threshold
competition
Jacques that was incredible how did you
do it well I've always taken good care
of my ears well thank you and
congratulations I'll let you go ahead
and prepare for your next event back to
you Lauren and Andi thanks Susan we're
going to take a brief break and go to a
word from one of our sponsors while the
next events being prepared</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
