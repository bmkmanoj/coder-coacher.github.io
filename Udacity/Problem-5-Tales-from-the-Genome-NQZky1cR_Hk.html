right because you've got to figure out
now from this amino acid chain to this
amino acid chain not just one of the
possible sequences you could have for
each of these chains but what actually
happened what is the change we know that
there's a single edition in a single
deletion approximately 15 sites apart in
the DNA that caused this change and to
figure this out you're essentially going
to have to do a lot of just critical
thinking drawing out the codons looking
at them one at a time in seeing what the
possibilities are now I came up with
there was an added guanine early on and
a deleted guanine about 15 nucleotides
later so there was an iguana added
somewhere here and a guanine deleted
from over here now that's not the only
answer possible in this question there
actually is another variation and a lot
of the students a lot of you guys have
come up some really interesting
questions and possibilities I encourage
you to go to the forums and check it out
some people have come up with some
helpful information to solve this more
methodically I don't want to give away
all the secrets here just wanted to give
you an answer video in case you're
completely stuck and want to know what
an answer is so that you could possibly
work backwards but go to the forums and
try to see if you can use some of the
other materials and tools that your
fellow students have created to help you
figure out this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
