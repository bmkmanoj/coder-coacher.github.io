we finished mean since analysis this was
the current state this was the goal
state as we saw for mean since analysis
achieving this goal state is not a very
easy problem however we can think of
this goal state as being composed of
several sub goals so D on top of table C
on top of D B on top of C a on top of B
for sub goals there now we can try to
address this problem by looking at one
sub goal at a time let us suppose that
we pick this up goal C on top of D given
that sub goal we can now start from this
current state and try to achieve the
circle now of course one might ask the
question why did we pick the goal C over
D and not the goal B over C or the goal
a over B well one reason is that the
difference between this state and that
state had to do with C over D well in
general problem reduction by itself does
not tell us which sub goal to attack
first that is a problem we'll address
later when we come to planning well now
the major point is that we can decompose
the goal into several sub goals and
attack one sample at a time now that we
have C over D as this sub goal we really
don't care about whether a is on B or B
is on C what we have focused on is the
other two state C is on table D's on
table because those are the blocks that
occur in the goal State
so let us now see how mean since
analysis may solve this sub problem will
be a worried only about a sub goal C
over D and D on table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
