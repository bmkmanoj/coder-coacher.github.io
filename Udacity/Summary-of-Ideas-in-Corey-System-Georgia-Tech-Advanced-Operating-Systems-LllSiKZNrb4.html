operating system for a shared memory
multiprocessor is to limit sharing
Colonel data structures which both
limits concurrency and increases
contention this principle finds
additional corroboration in the quarry
operating systems research that was done
at MIT which wants to involve the
applications that run on top of the
operating system to give hints to the
colonel so let's talk about some of the
ideas in the quarry system that is built
at MIT the ideas are similar to what we
saw in tornado namely you want to reduce
the amount of sharing that's the key
thing if you reduce the amount of
sharing it allows for scaling and one of
the things that is an cody system is
this idea of address ranges in an
application and basically this is
similar to the region concept in tornado
the region concept and tornadoes under
the covers the application doesn't know
anything about it it knows that an
application has an address space and the
operating system decides that well this
application has his address space but
the threads of this application are
accessing different regions and
therefore i'm going to partition this
data structure the global data structure
called the page table into regions and
that way i can ensure that there's
concurrency among the page fault service
handling for the different reasons and
that that the operating system has to
deal with similar idea except here the
address ranges are exposed to the
application so in other words a thread
says that this is the region in which i
am going to operate and if the colonel
knows the address range in which a
particular thread is going to operate in
then it can actually use that as a hint
in saying well what do I want to run
this thread if a bunch of threads are
touching the same address range maybe
you want to put it on the same processor
and these are the kinds of optimization
that the operating system can do if this
hint is provided by the application
similarly shares is another concept and
the idea here is that an application
thread can say that here is a data
structure here is a system facility that
I'm going to use but i'm not going to
share it with anybody an example would
be a file a
while by definition for a process is an
operating system entity once the process
opens the file that file descriptor is a
data structure that the operating system
maintains and now if you have multiple
threads in the same application all of
the threads have access to that file
descriptor but if a thread of their
application opens a file and it knows
that it's not going to share that file
with anybody else it can communicate
that intent through the shares mechanism
through the shares mechanism it can
communicate that intent to the operating
system saying that here is file that
I've opened but i'm not going to share
it with anybody else that hint is useful
once again for the kernel to optimize
shared data structures and in particular
if you have a multi-core processor and
if I have threads of an application
running on multiple course I don't have
to worry about the consistency of that
file descriptor across all these course
that gives an opportunity for reducing
the amount of work that the operating
system has to do in managing shared data
structures and other facilities that is
there and cory's dedicated course here
the idea is that if you have a
multi-core we have lots of course might
as well dedicate some of the cores for
Colonel activity and that way we can
confine the locality of Colonel data
structures to a few course and not have
to worry about moving data between the
course so all of these techniques that
are being proposed in the coding system
is really trying to attack the
fundamental problem that there is a huge
latency involved when you have to
communicate across course or when you
have to communicate outside of the core
into the into the memory subsystem and
so on and all of these facilities are
trying to reduce the amount of inter
corkum you negation and called a memory
communication and so on and so forth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
