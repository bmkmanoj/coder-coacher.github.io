good to you know figure out your
persistence figure out the objects
that'll be in the model write it and
test it once your model is in place and
it's tested enough that you're confident
in it it's just much easier to proceed
from there so once I have everything
already to to build a new project my
first step in Xcode is file new project
so the way I start a nap when I have an
idea is I want to sort of validate the
core proposition and just verify that I
can actually build it so I just dig in
as fast as I can I don't worry about a
lot about code quality I don't worry a
lot about um you know what the final
apps going to look like I just want to
sort of validate that usually its
inspiration um and that's what keeps me
coming back to finish the app so when
I'm starting to build the app I think
the most important thing is to get from
A to B as quick as you can I've done a
lot of different projects and where i
usually get stuck or stalled is when i
try to optimize for every little corner
case that might happen so taking what
your idea is and figuring out how to get
to stage one version one of the app just
have something that you can use and
that's usually what I try to peel first
I I take a lot of time to read the
documentation and to make sure what the
tools that I'm going to be using to make
the project are the right tools
sometimes you find that the tools are no
longer supported and you have to pivot
and find something new sometimes you
find something that just came out that's
better and easier to implement sometimes
you find the documentation is really
hard to read and you have to take more
time to just decipher what it is when
I'm starting a new project from scratch
I think of first I try and make a
Minimum Viable Product you know I think
of the simplest version of the app that
I can possibly think of and then I build
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
