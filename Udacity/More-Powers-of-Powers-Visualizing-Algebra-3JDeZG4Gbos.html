powers of powers here I don't just have
one base I of to have a base of four and
a base of 3 i'm multiplying 4 cubed + 3
squared and this quantity will be raised
to the fourth power if i want to
simplify this problem and in particular
the exponents i would need to rewrite
this first i write four cubed times
three squared four times that would be
this notice that i have multiplication
between every single term so this is
really just a product of factors and I
don't need to list the parentheses we
can rearrange the product of our factors
and I can group the four cubes together
and the three squares together if I
expanded it all this out I would have 12
fours and eight threes so I know my
final answer is 42 the twelfth x 3 to
the eighth so I know my final answer
would be four to the 12th and three to
date again I don't have to list all
these factors out when I'm doing this
work there must be a shorter way if I
look at how these exponents changed what
did I really do well it turns out that i
distributed this exponent of 4 to each
of the factors for cubed + 3 squared so
I 4 to the third raised to the fourth
power and 3 squared raised to the fourth
power now we just apply the rule that we
learned before when we raise a power to
a power we multiply the exponents
together so i get for to the twelfth and
three to the eighth pretty neat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
