the decision tree model let's build out
one over in all tracks what we're going
to start with is the exact same input
data plus select tool + create samples
what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to bring in a decision tree tool which
is found in our predictive category the
first thing I'm going to do is simply
named the model I want to simply call it
DT Redeemer I'm then going to select
what field am I trying to target which
is going to be that Redeemer field and
the next thing I'm going to do is select
my different predictor variables which
will be all the ones besides customer
key first name last name and the
Redeemer fields and some of the
different model customization options
are found in this tab where the first
thing that we can look at is the minimum
number of records needed to allow for a
split so what this means is the smaller
number that we choose here the more
splits that we're going to have in our
decision tree and the same thing for the
minimum number for a terminal node which
is the next option if we choose this
number to go down what we're going to
have is simply more terminal nodes these
last few items are definitely more
advanced and we're going to just keep
them simply by default if you would like
to read more on them please just refer
over to the reading notes right below
this section so before I kick off this
workflow what I'm going to do is put
browse tools after the are and I outputs
and we're going to examine them in the
next section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
