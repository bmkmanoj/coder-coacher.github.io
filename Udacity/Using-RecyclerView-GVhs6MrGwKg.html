lists of you you feed it with some sort
of an adapter like a cursor adapter
would you feed with the cursor loader
and you register an on item click
listener with the list view to get
notified when a list item is clicked and
you might have used a view holder
pattern to help you populate views with
that cursor adapter well using recycler
view we see some familiar faces like
cursor loader where view older was an
optional but recommended part of the
list view pattern it's required an
integral part of the recycler view
pattern now we don't have a cursor
adapter at the moment and that's not
such a terrible thing because now that
we have cursor loader doing the work of
reloading our cursors when content
changes cursor adapter didn't do all
that much we also don't have an on item
click listener now one could use the on
item touch listener along with a gesture
detector to determine when an item is
clicked but it's more common to just
have your view holder implement an
onclicklistener for the individual views
that it's holding the view holder has
access to the adapter position that has
been clicked and since it is typically
an inner class of your adapter it would
also have access to the adapter data for
click handling let's show how this works
in practice an on create view holder
from our adapter we inflate the
appropriate layout for the view type
note that our sample view holder
contains references the views just like
we would have done in the old-school
view holder pattern and on create view
holder from our adapter when we create
the view holder we have to pass the
route view into the superclass we then
construct the child views we want to
fill out if we wish this is also a good
place to set the onclicklistener for the
view note that we have to have our view
holder implement the onclicklistener to
use this pattern in this way and when we
buy the view holder we take advantage of
our view holder being a non-static inner
class for our adapter so it has access
to our data here in this case a cursor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
