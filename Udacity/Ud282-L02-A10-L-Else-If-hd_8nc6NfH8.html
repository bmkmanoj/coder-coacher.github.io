scenarios that require more than two
pathways to take like for our
self-driving car what if the traffic
light it sees is yellow we might want to
tell the car to perform some other
action like slow down but right now we
only have the options to stop or to
drive so how can we build off our
if-else statement to include more than
these two options well that's where the
else--if comes in the elsif comes after
an if but before an else statement and
it checks a different test condition
than the one in our if so instead of
checking if the light is green our
else--if can check if the light is
yellow and it provides another decision
pathway which is just an alternate set
of instructions like slow down and this
will only execute if our previous if
test condition is false so when is like
green is false our code will go to our
else--if and if it's test condition is
like yellow is true then we can print
out slow down in slow down becomes
another decision pathway so only if both
of these light conditions are false will
our code go to our else and print out
stop let's see what this looks like in
our self driving car java code here's
our code with our else--if the first
thing we need to know for our else--if
test condition is if the traffic light
is yellow so let's say we have a new
boolean variable is light yellow which
will be either true or false and then we
have our else--if after our if but
before our else statement and this
checks the test condition is light
yellow so if the light is yellow but not
green we'll enter our else--if and print
out slowed down and now we have three
decision pathways we can take one if the
light is green this prints drive -
otherwise if the light is not green but
it is yellow this will print out slow
down and three if none of those
conditions are met this prints out stop
so let's try this out first let's
consider what happens if is light green
is true and is light yellow is false and
in this case the value of is light
yellow won't matter and we'll see why
that is in
and now that we have these boolean
values the computer will go through our
decision-making code line by line it
first gets to our if statement and
checks whether is like green is true it
is true so we'll enter our if block of
code and print out Drive and this will
complete our code that's all that will
be printed our else--if and else
statements will be skipped entirely the
value of is light yellow will never even
be tested and that's because once the
computer executes SAN if block of code
like it did when it printed out drive it
will skip down to the very end curly
brace of our last else or else--if and
for this code that's at the very end of
our program now what if we switch these
boolean values so is like Green is false
and is light yellow is true the computer
will start again reading code from the
top and first read our if statement it
checks the test condition whether is
light green is true and this time it
isn't so it will move on down to our
next block or else if and our else--if
checks if is light yellow is true it is
so we'll enter our else--if block of
code and print out slow down our else
statement will be skipped again just
like in the last example and that's
because once the computer executes an
else--if block of code it will again
skip down to the end curly brace of the
last else or else if that means that for
even longer series of checks with
multiple else if statements only one of
their enclosed blocks of code can be
executed at a time the block that
belongs to whichever test condition is
met first only if both of these light
conditions are false will our computer
reach our else statement and print out
stop so if is like Green is false and is
light yellow is false that's the only
time that we reach our else statement
let's see some more examples of how to
use else ifs for decision making</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
