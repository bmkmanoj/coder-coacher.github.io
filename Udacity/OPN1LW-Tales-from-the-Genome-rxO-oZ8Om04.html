blindness have been found in over 56
genes on 19 different chromosomes
the most commonly inherited form of the
disorder comes from mutations on the X
chromosome so here's a zoomed in pair of
the sex chromosomes where the X
chromosome is a part and an individual
that's X Y remember the Y chromosome is
much shorter than the X now the X
chromosome is about a hundred and fifty
five million base pairs from tip to tip
and the OPN 1lw gene is located right
here close to the end of the X
chromosome notice that there's no
corollary because the Y chromosome is
much smaller and doesn't have the same
genetic information that the Y does here
the OPN 1lw gene is a gene with six
exons on the X chromosome spanning about
15,000 base pairs of DNA and it has an
allele that's associated with red-green
color blindness after a transcription
and splicing of the gene we're left with
the coding region is 1095 nucleotides
long
and so after translation we end up with
a protein that's 364 amino acids long
remember this math is pretty easy we
just divide 1095 by 3 to get 365 and
then subtract 1 to get 364 because
remember the stop codon doesn't code for
an amino acid it's just empty it means
stop now one allele of the OPN 1lw gene
contains a c a cytosine 2 t 2 thymine
mutation at position 739 of the coding
region i've highlighted the change in
red here now what I want you to do is
use the genetic code that you learned
about in lesson 3 and you can find in
the instructors notes on this page and
determine the change expected in the
amino acid sequence and select the type
of mutation that this C to T change is
most likely categorized as now if you
have trouble answering this you might
want to review mutations from lesson 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
