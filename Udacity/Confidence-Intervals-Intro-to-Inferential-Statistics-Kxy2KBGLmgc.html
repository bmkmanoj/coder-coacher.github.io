estimate can help us assess the accuracy
of our predictions we can make even more
accurate predictions by computing
confidence intervals for our predicted
values our y hats in other words when we
get our regression line we have our
expected value which is this y hat not
for a specified value X naught however
the actual value might be anything from
up here to down here or it might be
exactly equal to our predicted value
therefore we might want a confidence
interval around our expected value for
where the actual value might be
similarly we might want a confidence
interval for the true slope will have a
certain regression line and we'll have
calculated the slope for that regression
line based on our sample data and this
is just an example the slope could be
this or flatter down to here a
confidence interval for slope can tell
us the range for which the true
population slope might be you won't
actually calculate the confidence
interval in this lesson because we're
going to assume that you'll use a
computer to get it the important thing
is that you know what it means for
example let's say we have some sample
data that looks like this we calculate
that the regression line is y equals BX
plus a some slope and some intercept but
let's save in that we're able to look at
all the population data and it looks
like this now it looks to be slightly
downward sloping since we're assuming
this is the true regression line will
use the common notation for the
regression coefficients for the
population oh and these should have hats
since they're the predicted values if
this were the case where the sample
regression line is positively sloping
but the true regression line for the
population is negatively sloping that
would mean that the confidence interval
for B has a negative lower bound and a
positive upper bound it includes zero
within this range therefore if we run a
two-tailed hypothesis test for whether
or not the slope is equal to zero we
would fail to reject the null meaning
there's
no evidence that there's a linear
relationship between x and y based on
that sample in fact let's get more into
hypothesis testing for slope</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
