to create you will want to have some
concept of users to provide security and
custom information based on each
individual person using your application
so for this exercise I will create a new
models not PI file with a user class
like so it is not considered a safe
practice to store actual passwords in
your database for this reason I will
store the hash of a user password a hash
is the result of a mathematical
algorithm that can be used to map
digital data of arbitrary size to
digital data of a fixed size if my user
database were to be compromised or open
by an attacker it would be extremely
hard to decode the real passwords from
the hashes hashing algorithms are
one-way functions meaning that they can
only be used to generate a hash from a
password but they cannot be used in the
reverse direction these algorithms are
also deterministic this means that given
the same inputs they will always
generate the same output in order to
create these hashes I will use a library
called pass lip a package dedicated to
password hashing pasla provides several
hashing algorithms to choose from the
custom app context object is an easy to
use option based on the sha-256 hashing
algorithm to add password hashing and
verification I'm going to add two new
methods to the user model I'll use them
later on in my coat this hash password
method takes in a plain password as an
argument and stores a hash of it in the
user table this method will also be
called when a new user is registering
with the server or if the user changes
her password this verify password method
takes a plain password as the argument
and returns true if the password is
correct or false if it's not this method
is called whenever the user provides
credentials that they need to be
validated all passed lib needs to do to
verify a password is to hash it with the
same function that was used during
registration and then compare the
resulting hash against the ones stored
in the database this means that we never
have to store a real password in our
database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
