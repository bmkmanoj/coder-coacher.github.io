type 1 die this expression pretty much
looks like it but then again it appears
here with a plus sign for f2 so this
father models that fish off type of one
become fish of type 2 after a certain
time remember the SI our model for
contagious diseases a person's moved
from one compartment to another
compartment so no so fish of type 1
don't die it's rather that we have to
type of fish and the first type becomes
the second type after a while young fish
in material fish this growth rate can
model both births and deaths it takes
care of the difference so in a way we
have taken care of deaths and births
from the beginning what about our fish
of type 2 harvested or not we've already
explained the first term what about the
second one at least this is not constant
harvesting for constant harvesting we
should be subtracting constant rate so
and so many tons per here this could be
however harvesting that's proportional
to the actual amount of fish maybe just
every second fish is being harvested so
maybe all in all however the second term
looks like that fish of type to die of
old age
