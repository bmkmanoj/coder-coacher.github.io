derivative of the exponential function
we already know one value the derivative
of the exponential function at x equals
zero is one because the slope of the
tangent line is one which was our
definition of the exponential function
everything else can be derived from that
for the help of this equation e to the
power of X plus h equals e to the power
of x times e to the power of h this
looks rather simple but this is the key
to compute the derivative for every X
let's say H is a number close to zero
then e to the H describes this part of
the curve of the graph that is of the
exponential function e to the power of X
plus h describes some other part of that
graph bond that's centered around the
value of x now this equation tells us
that we can use the green part of that
graph magnify it by e to the power of X
and get the red part of that graph of
course the same thing would happen to
the slope triangle here which means the
slope increases by a factor of e to the
power of X we do know that the slope at
the origin is 1 so this slope has to be
e to the power of x times 1 it's the
exponential function itself again this
is a fundamental result the derivative
of e to the power of X with respect to X
equals e to the power of X the
exponential function the exponential
function I should be saying is its own
derivative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
