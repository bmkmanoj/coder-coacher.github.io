go through a couple steps typically you
have to sign up for an account with the
service if you don't have one already
you have to register the app you're
making and later on
in order to make request there's usually
some sort of authentication process
involved in order to keep this setup
simple for now our sleeping in the
library app is going to use the Flickr
API
unlike other similar services Flickr's
API allows us to bypass a few of the
normal setup steps requiring us only to
sign up and register will cover the part
skipped namely the authentication flow
later in the course signing up for a
service like Flickr or Yahoo is pretty
straightforward so let's talk about
registration when you register an app
you're usually given what's called an
API key and sometimes additional keys as
well that are used to uniquely identify
your app the reason for a service to
want to uniquely identify your app is so
that they can detect requests coming
from your app and protect against apps
that are making too many requests this
allows the service to ensure apps don't
do harmful stuff like say flood the
network with so many requests that their
server shuts down so you can see why
these identification keys would come in
handy so let's get started using our API
you'll want to sign up for a yahoo
account if you don't have one already I
know this part may be a little bit
annoying but trust me this does make our
life simpler click create an app and
then you want to get your API key you
want to click non-commercial since we
don't plan on making any money off of
pictures of people sleeping in the
library you'll then fill out these two
fields and upon submitting you'll
receive a key and secret I'm going to
call this sleeping in the library
copy these two values and paste them
somewhere safe you'll need them soon
lastly you'll want to take some time and
look around the Flickr API documentation
this will give you an idea of some of
the methods that you could potentially
use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
