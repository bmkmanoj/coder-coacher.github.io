there's a lot going on in this example
and some of it you may not have seen
before i'm making a procedure called
make greeter that and this is cute
inside of it defines another procedure
if you haven't seen this before in
python don't worry but it is possible to
make one function inside another here
i'm making a function called greeter
that takes a person to be talking to and
prints out a particular greeting to that
person and then this make greeter
function returns greeter this function
that I just defined in here wow this is
not obvious so down here i'm making a
variable say hello which is the result
of making a greeter who always starts
with hello from uttar pradesh and then i
can ask that greeter to say hello to
gracie and also say hello to look now so
say hello points to or references a
particular version of greeter where the
greeting has been locked in to be hello
from the u.p if you haven't been there
Uttar Pradesh is a region in India its
capital city is luck now known as the
city of Nawabs it's known for its
manufacturing and retailing possibly
also silversmithing cool place very
populous so here ivory copied the same
code from before nothing has changed
except that I'm abbreviating butta
Pradesh with you p and now over here on
the right I'm drawing out the chained or
nested environment frames as we are
calling say hello Gracie I'd like you to
help me out with just the last part down
here in this final environment frame
there's a single variable bound to a
value I'd like you to fill in these two
blanks so that this picture of the
environment is complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
