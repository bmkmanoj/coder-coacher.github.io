buy stocks that you hold in your
portfolio is by issuing orders usually
you send those orders to a stockbroker
and they take care of executing them for
you we're gonna dive now into the
details of what happens when you create
an order and how it gets to the market
and back and how things can go wrong and
how they can potentially go right the
first stop there is to think about what
is actually in an order what are the
components of an order that can go to a
stock exchange here is all the
information that must go into a
well-formed order first of all we need
to know are you looking to buy or sell
shares of a stock next is the symbol
this is an identifier for the stock or
perhaps ETF that you want to buy or sell
for instance IBM or SPL V next you need
to tell your broker how many shares you
want to buy or sell stocks and ETFs and
other assets are sold in units of shares
not by amount of money so you don't tell
your broker you know I want $100,000
worth of Apple you tell your broker I
want a thousand shares of Apple next you
need to tell your broker whether this is
a limit order or a market order let's
start with market first market means
you're willing to accept a good price
but essentially whatever price the
market is currently bearing and I'm
going to show you in a moment how that's
determined a limit price means you don't
want to do any worse than a certain
price for instance suppose you're
selling some stock you might specify I
don't want it to be sold below a
particular price or if you're buying
stock you might say I don't want to pay
more than a certain amount to get it if
you're issuing a limit order then you
have to say what the corresponding price
is if it's a market order you're not
able to specify that price because
essentially when you issue the market
order you're saying I'll take whatever
price come
back let's take a look at a couple
examples or ders here's one by IBM 100
shares limit 99.95 so this means I want
to buy a hundred shares of IBM at no
more than $99.95
another example sell Google 150 shares
market notice there's no price with this
because we're going to take whatever the
market price is so let's look at what
happens when these orders reach the
exchange</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
