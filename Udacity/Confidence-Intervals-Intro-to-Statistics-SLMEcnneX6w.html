programming and if what I want is really
simple on an input a sample and a
hypothesis and now it should come as
simple yes or no whether accepted so
this piece of code should just do it and
for simplicity I assume 95% confidence
and two-sided tests so here's what I do
I'm gonna give you a functions you
already know you already programmed the
mean function here is again notice the
use of the word float in case the list
doesn't have a float happens to be on
these artifacts of type conversions in
Python but nevermind then we have a
variance function that you programmed
before and here's the variance function
in a very compact way and then I also
should really implement the tea-table
but I was lazy so I'll just give you one
point nine six even though we know
that's not quite correct and when I give
you a list this was the list of height
in my basketball club in a print the
mean then it's hard to see but I should
indeed get to oh 1.5 give it a try and
whatever want you to implement now is
the function conf which is the
plus/minus term in the confident vowel
below and above the mean if I run it for
this data sequence over here from $1.99
to two or four I indeed get one point
three six six five four four so back in
your code to lift the function conf open
and please insert your code right here
you can do this in one line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
