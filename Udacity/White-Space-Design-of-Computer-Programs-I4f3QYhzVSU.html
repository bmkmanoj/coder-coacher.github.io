grammar here and if i have this function
to define grammars and if i write a
function to parse i can take this and if
i have an expression like MX plus B
going to parse it just great
unfortunately with this description just
as it is I would have a trouble with MX
plus B with spaces in between it because
nowhere here did I say that spaces can
occur between tokens and in some
grammars you're free to put spaces
everywhere and in other grammars you
aren't and if I want this grammar
function to be useful I should be able
to tell which is which and so I'm going
to show a new version of grammar that
takes that into account and here it is
and there's two things you should note
about notice about it right away first
is that I've add an optional parameter
to say you can specify what white space
is allowed in between tokens here that's
saying s star is allowed any number of
space at zero or more and you could
change that if you have a different type
of grammar you're defining secondly have
much longer documentation here
documentation string describing what the
language is and third I've added one
more statement here which says if there
are any tabs in the input replace them
with spaces why did I do that well
notice that I'm splitting here on arrow
surrounded by spaces in an orb are
surrounded by spaces and if somebody had
written something and used a tab there
rather than a space that would be really
hard to debug so I don't want to have to
force them to debug it I'm going to do
the debugging for them and make that not
be an error at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
