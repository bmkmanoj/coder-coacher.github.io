course is called a heat map for our data
set we want to display each combination
of gene and sample case the difference
in gene expression in the sample from
the baseline we want to display
combinations where a gene is
overexpressed in red and combinations
where it is under expressed in blue
here's the code to make that heat map
first we'll run all of this in order to
melt our data to a long format and then
we just run our ggplot code using the
giome giome tile now this last line is
going to give us a scale gradient and
we're going to use the colors from blue
to red so let's see what the output
looks like
and there's our heat map even with such
a dense display we aren't looking at all
the data in particular we're just
showing the first 200 genes that's 200
genes of over 6000 of them and since
this data set was produced genomic data
sets of these kind sometimes called
micro data are only getting larger and
more complex what's most interesting is
that other data sets also look like this
for example internet companies run lots
of randomized experiments where in the
simplest versions users are randomly
assigned to a treatment like a new
version of a website or some sort of new
feature or product or a control
condition then the difference in outcome
between the treatment and control can be
computed for a number of metrics of
interest in many situations there might
have been hundreds or thousands of
experiments and hundreds of metrics this
data looks very similar to the genomic
data in some ways and this is why the
useful Maxim plot all the data might not
always apply to a data set as it did for
most of this course</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
