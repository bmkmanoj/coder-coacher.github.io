solution to this final problem set for
unit 1 the first thing we have to do is
fill in the definition for the
acceleration function now the
acceleration function takes an argument
that we've called spaceship position but
we can define the position of the
spaceship in relation to earth with this
variable vector dearth a vector pointing
from the earth to the spaceship is just
the opposite of a vector pointing from
the spaceship to the earth so we define
vector to earth as the negative of this
argument spaceship position hopeful now
since we're trying to define the
acceleration what we want to return is
an expression for acceleration so we
write return and then a translation of
this equation over here that we talked
about earlier so we have the
gravitational constant which is big G
times the earth mass which is M e
divided by this expression that looks
pretty tricky so let's dissect that
briefly and the first thing we have
right here is a method from the linear
algebra library which gives us the norm
or the magnitude of whatever vector we
put into it
we of course are inputting the vector
from the spaceship to the earth now over
here we can see in the original equation
that the denominator is just the norm of
that vector squared but in the code we
have it to the 3rd power now the reason
for this is that we're also multiplying
by that same vector again whereas in the
equation for multiplying by the unit
vector this means that in the Python
version of the equation we effectively
have the magnitude cubed in the
denominator and the magnitude to the
first power in the numerator which gives
overall a factor of 1 over the magnitude
squared which is exactly what we see in
the original equation this makes our job
a little bit easier because we don't
have to define a unit vector for the
vector to earth now we move on to the
definition of the function ship
trajectory since we gave you all of this
code we skip down here to this final for
loop this is something that we've seen
several times before for example in the
last problem set these two lines
implement the forward Euler method to
show how position and velocity are going
to change with each step once we had all
of this code filled in we can run the
program and our final product is this
picture now this picture looks a lot
like we would expect from an elliptical
orbit we have the earth here and the
spaceship moving around it now
everything looks pretty normal until we
get almost to the end and we realized
the ellipse act
we won't close this is a great example
of how the forward Euler method is a
method using approximations if we were
using more exact expressions for
position and velocity then we would end
up with a closed ellipse and we can also
play with the number of steps that we
use to show how increasing the steps
gives us a more exact approximation of
the trajectory of the spaceship now
we've done something that I think is
pretty cool right here you changed the
number of steps from 13,000 to 1.3
million this means that since we've kept
the step size the same this picture
shows what the position of the spaceship
would be like after much more time has
passed after it's gone through many many
orbits so even though in that initial
orbit the trajectory only seems slightly
off if we let that happen
over and over and over again eventually
the spaceship will be much further away
from Earth than it was originally
and now just to play with this example a
little bit more we've gone in and first
changed the step size so that it's
one-tenth of the size that it used to be
this should give us a much more exact
approximation since we're taking steps
more closely together however we've also
had to change the number of steps from
the original 13,000 up to 130,000 so
that we still have the same number of
seconds total that the spaceship is in
orbit which is a result of this changed
code at first it might look pretty
similar to what we had after we ran the
program the first time however if you
examine the end of the trajectory a
little bit more closely you can see that
this tail looks like it's actually going
to intersect with the beginning this
time it actually looks like the ellipse
might close which we remember is what
the trajectory in real life would look
like this is a great example of how
changing the step size when using the
forward Euler method can greatly
decrease the air and the results we
produce in the next unit we'll look at
another numerical method that deals with
similar situations but in a slightly
different way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
