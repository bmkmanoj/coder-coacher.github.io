the Watson digital business group and my
role is that of an academic technical my
educational and professional journey
it's it's fascinating how it has all
merged together so well and only now
that it makes perfect sense my
bachelor's was in industrial
organizational behavior psychology from
there on I went on and I got a master's
in computer science and an MBA in
computer information systems my
professional journey actually has been
quite diverse
I started off as a staff accountant and
it happened to be in software companies
and I had noticed that there were
technical writers and that's something
that I had been gravitated to because I
had a talent in writing and it was
hidden behind the numbers I noticed that
these tech writers they're sitting
behind the largest machines with the
great screens they had their own hours
they would come in and go as as they
wished and to me that sounded like the
perfect thing to move onto I ended up
having quite quite a great time with it
and even today that is coming in handy
as I develop my courses as academic
tekmoto I decided to take on an academic
membership role really through an
accidental coincidence of events that
took place I had been working in IBM
development and I had an opportunity
during the past few years to run
enablement for internals it was through
one of those one of my students that
pointed me out to a professor that was
teaching at the University of Singapore
Ferguson's professor Ferguson's and he
asked that if this particular student
knew anybody that would be able to come
in and teach about what's in to students
and once I tried that he invited me to
University of Singapore and from there
on I absolutely fell in love with with
the world of academia with the
professors with the students and I went
back to my management and I said this is
what I want to do we need to create a
role for this position what I love about
my job is that it really merges two
important things in my mind the notion
of know-how and the notion of talent I
think that if you can use talent in what
you do on a daily basis it's a blessing
it's a blessing really not even in
disguise when I'm at when I'm not
traveling when I'm not engaged with
teaching activities I am learning
learning is a joy just like rock
climbing motorcycles sailing is a joy
learning itself is a joy and as I
learned these new services and api's and
then I take an opportunity to translate
those into workshops and lectures and
then the talent kicks in to be able to
stand in front of an audience and
inspire them to really put a love of
this science this technology in their
hearts and minds some of the challenges
that I'm trying to solve in my job is to
have a better opportunity a greater
grasp being able to follow through with
a lot of these academics and
universities globally that we are
engaged with to see how they have
progressed did they make any apps or
they're thinking of an entrepreneurship
and I am hoping in the forthcoming
months we will have this opportunity to
really follow up on the good work on the
seeds that we plant if you would and and
see how they have grown my message to
students who are interested in creating
a career in AI is that embrace it to
begin with and if you are now in school
studying mathematics let me tell you
that is
come in handy calculus to bear that in
mind our statistics always if you talk
to a statistician they would say they
can explain the world with statistics
frankly if we talk to an economist they
would say they can explain the world
with economics but the joy the notion of
not just the confines of AI but to learn
to read to publish and various online
magazines and publications working with
artificial intelligence is working with
algorithms working with algorithms is
being an artist you design you create
you build something it is your canvas if
you like to work with canvas instead of
a brush it is mathematics this is an
amazing career to embark on lsdm long
short-term memory is an algorithm
actually that a lot of our developers
are now expanding which we use a merit
of machine learning mechanisms and
algorithms we certainly start with brute
statistics such as support vector
machines and Bayesian inferences and as
we then try the neural nets approach
such as convolutional neural nets
recurrent neural nets and lately lsdm
long short term memory and I think it is
this new set of algorithms this new
neural approach that is going to help us
to move from any artificial narrow
intelligence into the realm of
artificial general intelligence water
fantastic that mathematics is the
language of the gods if you ask a
physicist he will say it takes physics
to explain the universe if you ask a
mathematician it would say music is
mathematics how often I have seen those
who have a keen sense of music happen to
be good with mathematics yes yes I would
say a mindset that starts with
understanding that the
construct of math is one that is really
well suited for working artificial
intelligence
you know what brings me the most joy in
my career is frankly the very few
moments that for I think many is the
scariest moments it's a stepping in
front of those students it is as though
these viewed them as as my children I
walk into the room with a big smile they
have pointed that to me actually and
then I begin to weave stories and I
think it's through these stories that we
both grow not only the students but I
personally as well at the end of the
lecture
it is a natural high how do you get high
give a lecture I am convinced that it
does I know that it does I think that
enthusiasm I can see it in their faces
they're taking pictures of the slides
the way they're leaning forward it's as
though I am guiding their emotions
through a story of some despair I
consider despair faceless as I come up
with a joke oftentimes made on the fly
like the roar and the left or in the in
the entire audience baby wakes the whole
class up what a priceless question how
does one go about finding what it is
that love frankly I say finding what it
is that you would love to do is far
harder than doing it so many of us takes
so many years into our 40s 50s hopefully
if at all
that we embark upon doing something that
we just love there's a note saying let
die vocation be die this I think one way
that you can embark upon that unless
from the very early age very few of us
who were blessed by knowing what it is
they wanted to do is by trying out so
many disciplines while listening to so
many different variety of music but by
in by not being hung up on a certain way
of being seeing a bit of everyone in
yourself
I think these traits these characters
this openness the joy of being with
people slowly would make all these
disparate seemingly disjointed things
that you have done over the years gel
into something that now harkens
your enthusiasm your talent and all you
have to do now is feed it with good old
know-how of the one science that you
really like what are people's reactions
when they see IBM at work one of the
first things that I think they end up
appreciating maybe not at first but soon
thereafter certainly before I leave the
workshop is that Bravo IBM for bringing
your technology to us on day two even
though it is not so baked and solid and
foolproof in a sense you are allowing us
to be developers in here really the
whole notion of open sources yes I know
my conversation service has room to grow
I understand that some of these nodes
are kludgy and too big and so forth but
thank you I am working with it I'm using
it I am seeing the pain points I am
suggesting them and I think once by the
end of the workshop this appreciation
that Wow they worked with something that
just is as they say fresh off the press
I think that's quite valuable oh my god
you said it very fast actually is what
our general manager Bob Lord says in his
town hall meetings and how do we fail
fast a by breaking down the silos let
people the check one another's work and
not have this mentality of hoarding and
guiding or code set but give it out as
soon as it is on release one and let let
the code of fail fast and by the next
week we will have advanced that much
more faster than if we were guarding it
again cautious against possibly looking
what is my vision for the AI and the
future I think that health concerns
medical uses of Watson perhaps would
consume us
I won't be surprised in my lifetime that
I would have nanobots within my
bloodstream
checking the salt the sugar levels and
yes I would like to know frankly I would
like to know that now I also think that
a lot of the mundane tasks driving for
example truck driving
I don't see why truck drivers need to be
engaged with driving a truck but they
can still be in their truck I'm glad you
asked that
absolutely absolutely it was on the way
to the airport I was in the taxi and a
truck just sweats right away in front of
our plane and it was because of another
car that had drove an erratically the
cab driver said you know my
brother-in-law is actually a truck
driver and truck drivers their
preference is to drive at night so they
don't have to deal with the traffic of
the data but they have a mandate they
must log that they have slept during the
night this is a genuine concern yes it
is and it did frustrates them
that is exactly antithetical to how they
would like to approach their career and
says he was driving more I started to
thinking to myself how awesome would it
be if that truck was an autonomous
vessel no it hadn't done away with
anybody's job the truck driver was still
in the vessel not doing driving truck
but perhaps sleeping while the vessel is
getting there at night waking up and
opening up the laptop and doing
inventory as he's about to unload his
merchandise something that there's no
need to be done in the at noon when when
it gets over there during rush hour
I think artificial intelligence would
find its way in taking away the mundane
the arduous and
letting us focus on what it is that is a
meaningful work thank you for that
question
truly augmented intelligence I generally
personally also believe in Ginni Rometty
his message and I do think she's doing
an amazing job in steering this ocean
liner because this isn't a ship that can
immediately go this way or that way it
takes a change in paradigm in in culture
in mindset in the way we sell not
million-dollar products but services
platforms and augmented intelligence I
think is really the foundation the
underlying mindset that we need to take
on this technology here is to help not
to supplant not to hinder not to take
away but to add to my capabilities as a
doctor if I am prescribing so many
medication for my patients I sure would
like to consult a second opinion and
find out that geez these exact
measurements of certain drugs that I'm
about to prescribe had certain side
effects few years back to a certain
patient in England maybe I should go
with four milligrams instead of the
eighth start of what's going to there is
no way for me to know these publications
that are coming out law would have the
same impact also how often do we hear of
accidents where the person from behind
is usually the one that's at fault and
the person in the front who was involved
in the accident is not at fault
it's a typical but what if the person in
the front was engaged in road rage and
they slammed on the brakes a number of
times of forcing this accident perhaps
Watson can be aware of such an incident
that took place many years ago in a
certain place and maybe the lawyer now
can quickly come across a case that
would help him have his client oh my
goodness the notion of nanodegrees is
the opportunity no question I won't be
surprised if some years down the road
and we were having this discussion
earlier
that the notion of having all these
masters and PhDs program would be a good
fit if you want to remain in academia
and be a researcher but one who is there
implementing and solving solutions being
an entrepreneur may not need such years
and hundreds of thousands and so much
debt these nano degrees are focused
specific and they are designed to solve
an immediate need current challenge that
organizations are actually running into
let the organization communicate with
their learning educational systems and
tell em doc this is what I need to hire
this is what I need and I don't see that
in your curriculum this collaboration
that we have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
