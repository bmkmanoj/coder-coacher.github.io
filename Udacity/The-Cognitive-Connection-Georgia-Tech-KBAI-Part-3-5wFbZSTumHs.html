cognition it is central because action
selection is central to cognition you
and I a constantly faced with the
problem of selecting actions we should I
go for dinner today what should I cook
for dinner today how do i cook what I
wanted to cook I got a bonus what should
I do with the bonus should I go for a
vacation how should I go to vacation
where should I go to vacation these are
all problems of action selection and I
need planning to select the appropriate
actions cognitive agents also have
multiple goals as a professor one of my
goals right now is to talk with you
another goal that I have is to become
rich although i know that becoming a
professor is not going to make me rich
the point is that cognitive agents are
multiple goals that can have
interactions between them sometimes
interaction is positive achieving one
goal provides an opportunity for Jimmy D
second goal sometimes the interaction is
negative their conflict cognitive agents
detect those conflicts they avoid those
conflicts and planning then is a central
process for achieving multiple goals at
the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
