optimization patterns now in a
supplementary material you'll find
pointers to a fantastic couple of papers
by John Stratton and colleagues at the
University of Illinois one is titled
optimization and architecture effects on
GPU computing workload performance and
it was published in the innovative
parallel computing conference in 2012 a
reworked version of that same basic
paper was published later that year in I
Triple E computer the computer paper is
a little shorter and more readable now
what they did is survey a whole bunch of
highly optimized parallel codes pay
attention to the patterns that emerged
and extracted seven fundamental
techniques that come up over and over
again and as you'll see several of these
techniques encapsulate or formalize
lessons that we've already learned so
this will also be a good review of
material that we've covered in unit 2
and unit 5 and along the way in the
homeworks let's walk through the
taxonomy of seven techniques that
they've come up with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
