with yesterday but unfortunately it had
an accident it exploded all over my
piece of paper and you can see I ended
up with a pretty big mess I even got it
all over my hands I don't know if you
can tell but my fingers were pretty red
yesterday now the big problem however is
that I lost a bunch of the work I had
done I started out with a polynomial and
then found all of its zeros but now I
can only see three of them think you can
make it out here 12 and I so I'm trying
to figure out how much work i need to do
to figure out I last 0 joining to
actually recalculate it to answer this
question please just right yes or no in
this box in the event that you right no
in this box and we can find this fourth
zero without really doing any math at
all right what the fourth 0 is in this
box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
