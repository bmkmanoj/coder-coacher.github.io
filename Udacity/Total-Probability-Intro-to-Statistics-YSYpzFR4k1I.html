notation we given the probability of
having cancer and from that it follows
that we know the probability of not
having cancer and we're giving to
conditional probability that of the test
being positive if you have cancer from
which we can now predict the probability
of the test being negative of having
cancer in the probability of the test
being positive kindof the cancer-free
which we can't compute the probability
of a negative test result in the
cancer-free case so these things are
just easily inferred by the 1 minus Rho
they were we really did as you complete
the probability of a positive test
result as the sum of a positive test
result given cancer times the
probability of cancer which is our truth
table entry for the combination of p and
c plus the same can be done of cancer
now this notation is confusing and
complicated if we ever dive deeply into
probability you know that's called total
probability but it's useful to know that
this is very very intuitive and to
further develop intuition let me just
give you another exercise of exactly the
same type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
