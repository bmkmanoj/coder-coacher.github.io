number 9 1 minus P to the one minus X I
and this is actually quite remarkable
the reason why i wrote p to the X I
overhears because we already learned
every time we see a heads we want to
multiply in P so by putting this in the
exponent when X i equals 1 we multiply
in p and if x i equals 0 we multiply in
one which has no effect this is exactly
the inverse you're going to multiply in
1 minus p for the tails probability
whenever we see details in which case 1
minus x I let me one otherwise 1 minus X
I is 0 and we just multiply in one which
has no effect the logarithm of this guy
over here is number 1 X i log P the
first derivative of this expression over
here is number seven and that's
interesting is not number two there's a
minus sign over here and the minus sign
is inherited from the minus sign inside
the logarithm using the chain rule of
differentiation there was really
non-trivial this one will be number 11
we're multiplying in p + 1 minus p the
bar minus p stays and likewise this here
is number for multiplying this out mrs.
exactly one term minus px I which is
number three now we observe that these
minus px I and plus px I can't see that
out so we get this expression over here
equals 0 which is number 12 when we now
take P to the other side we realize
there's n editions of P number 6 and
finally we bring n back to the left side
to use number 8 1 over N and we are now
done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
