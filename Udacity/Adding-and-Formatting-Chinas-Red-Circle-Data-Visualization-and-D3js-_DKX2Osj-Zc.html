circle on the x and y position we'll
have to use the two scales we just
defined before I actually append a
circle to the SVG element I just want to
make sure that the scales are somewhat
sensible for China remember the life
expectancy on the y-axis was 75 and the
England per person and the x-axis was
8347 the console dot log function in
JavaScript simply prints its arguments
to the console in this case the chrome
developer console as you can see here 75
mapped to 30 and 8347 mapped to 146
point for approximately these seems
sensible since on the y-axis I have a
range of zero to 150 pixels the lower
the value actually corresponds to a
higher pixel position and on the x-axis
we have a range from 0 to 250 now that
we've checked their scales seem to be
doing what we expect them let's try to
append the circle into our SVG element
remember we stored our SVG element in a
variable so we could access it later
into this SVG element we want to append
what do we want to append in this case
an SVG circle element and in order to
make sure that that circle actually
shows up we have to give some attributes
the first attribute I want to add is the
constant radius of 10 the second
attribute and one of the easiest is the
fill color on the last two attributes we
have to add are the x and y position as
you can see here again d threes
chainable syntax allows me to just pass
the circle element from one method call
to the next and keep adding different
attributes as it goes down the chain the
SVG circle element has CX and cui which
correspond to the center x and center y
running this code we see the a red
circle has spontaneously showed up on
our page which means that we've done
something right unfortunately out of the
context of every other circle from the
gap minor plot where aren't too sure of
how correct this is
if we hover over our SVG to see the
borders and if we look at the Gapminder
visualization we see that the red circle
is in approximately the right place that
is all i want to show you for now in the
console playing around with d3 but
hopefully I've shown you some methods
that you can use to create
visualizations of your own again if
anything I've showed you you would like
to know more about there's a few
resources in the instructor notes or the
d3 site itself and Mike Bostock blog the
creator of d3 have some great examples
to go off of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
