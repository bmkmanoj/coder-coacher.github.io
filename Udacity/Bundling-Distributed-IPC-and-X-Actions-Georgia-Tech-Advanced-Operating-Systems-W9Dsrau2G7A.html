IPC with recovery management the secret
sauce for recovery management is the
notion of transaction it's a
light-weight version of transaction not
the heavyweight version that you
normally associate with databases in
that sense the notion of a transaction
in Quicksilver is very similar to what
we saw in lr vm in fact it is perhaps
fair to say that lr vm inherits the
semantics of transaction similar to what
was proposed in the Quicksilver because
Quicksilver predates lr vm and the IPC
calls are tagged with transaction ID
let's say a client makes a call to a
server an IPC call to a server now
because of location transparency the
client and the servers can be on
different machines in the entire local
area network under the cover the client
contacts the Quicksilver colonel on the
node that is on let's say node a which
in turn contacts the Communication
Manager that's part of the operating
system of Quicksilver and implemented as
a server process above the colonel now
this communication manager a node a
contacts the communication manager on
node B we are the colonel on node B so
all of this is happening under the
covers when a client makes an IPC call
to the server depending on the nature of
the clients of a relationship there's
going to be state associated with this
client-server interaction further the
communication manager may itself have
state when it is communicating with its
peer on a different note of the network
we would like to make sure that a state
that is associated with the
communication manager as well as the
state associated with the high level
client-server relationship that I'm
showing you all of these are recoverable
from failures and the failures may be
things like link failure or crashing of
the server any of these will result in
state being left behind and what we
would like to make sure is all such
state that is left behind in the entire
distributed system
is recoverable so under the cover the
Communication Manager on node a contacts
its transaction manager and the
transaction manager node a in turn
contacts its peer on node B and our
transaction link is established as a way
of recording the trail of client-server
interactions to lay the facilitate
picking up the bread crumbs that may
potentially be left behind when the
client-server interaction terminates
either successfully or unsuccessfully so
the creator of the transaction is the
default owner of the transaction that is
the root of the transaction tree others
are participants in this example I am
just showing you that a client-server
relationship exists here the transaction
manager contacts its peer and this guy
says yes I am willing to participate in
this transaction so this is the
transactional tree that gets established
as a byproduct of the original
client-server interaction so the owner
that is the root of the transaction is
the coordinator for the transaction tree
that gets established and as we will see
shortly this transaction tree can span
several sites because a transaction that
starts here goes to the server may go to
other service so the creator of the
transaction is the owner of the
transaction but the owner can also
change ownership as well as change the
coordinator for this transaction and
we'll see how that is useful in a minute
the clients servers can choose to remain
completely unaware of transactions if
they so choose in other words the
mechanisms are there provided buying the
quiksilver operating system but it is up
to each service provider whether or not
to use them and there is no extra
overhead for the communication that i'm
showing you between these transaction
managers on these different nodes
because it happens naturally as part of
the IPC that has to happen anyway in the
distributed system that is the
communication
that is needed for these transaction
managers to handshake to say that yes I
received your transaction request I want
to participate in it that is piggybacked
on the normal communication that happens
to support this inter process
communication between the client and the
server through the communication manages
on these different notes they are
piggybacked on top of regular IPC so
there is no extra overhead for the
communication among the transaction
managers so a chain of client-server
interactions leads to a transaction tree
as client-server interactions can span
multiple nodes are multiple sites on the
local area network so the root of the
transaction tree who is the owner that
initiated the original transaction
through the IPC call and these are all
the participants who said that yes we
are also part of this IPC chain and will
participate in this transaction that was
initiated by this owner examples of how
these client-server interactions lead to
the creation of transaction trees you
can have a client making a call to a
window manager asking for something to
be painted on the screen and then under
the covers will result in a transaction
link between these two nodes or a client
could make a request to a file server
for opening a file that would result in
a transaction tree getting established
between the participating nodes and you
can see in these examples what kind of
brick trumps will get created on behalf
of the client the window manager may
have opened up a window on the display
and that's a piece of bread crumb that
has been created on behalf of his client
and similarly the file server may have
opened the file and kept some pointers
to wear this client is in that
particular file that's part of the
breadcrumb that the file server is
creating on behalf of this client and
those are the states that we would like
them to be recoverable if in fact there
is any failure I mentioned early
hear that IPC calls are tagged with the
transaction ID that gets created under
the covers and these transaction IDs or
automatic the clients and the servers
don't have to do anything special for
that but at the same time they don't
have to care about them either if they
don't want to use it in any fashion or
form that the key point is the
transactions are provided in the
operating system from the point of view
of recovery and because a client-server
relationship can traverse multiple nodes
or sites in the local area network it is
important to make sure that
recoverability has to worry about
multi-site atomicity a transaction that
originated in one node may traverse
several different nodes and leave bread
crumbs all over the place all of those
have to be cleared up when a transaction
terminates so there is coordination that
needs to be done and this is where the
transaction tree is very useful and
since the transaction that is used as a
secret sauce in Quicksilver is purely
for recovery management semantics are
very simple and there is no worry about
concurrency control either</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
