testing as part of this class we're
going to be working on a final project
together for example a web browser for
HTML and JavaScript you'll want to
ensure that it's correct that it does
what it's supposed to do now one of the
best ways to make that happen is to stop
and think before you write anything and
plan and reason about how the program
will go it's like designing a building
before you set out to build it if you
have even the most rudimentary
blueprints your odds of success go up
quite a bit but often we don't spend the
time we would like or we don't have the
resources to plan everything in
meticulous detail so at some point we
just go out and write the source code at
which point you want to test the
implementation let me give you another
example of mistakes and testing by
imagining that I'm going to miss make a
mistake when writing our code to look up
a variable in the environment remember
that our environment is a tuple of a
parent pointer and then a Python
dictionary that map's variable names
like X or Y two values like 22 or 33 so
when it comes time to look up a variable
in the environment we check and see if
the variable name is in the dictionary
that's the one component of this tuple
and if it is we just return it so there
are three cases one possibility is we
have a value for the variable another
possibility is we are the global
environment our parent pointer is none
so if we don't have it no one does we'll
just return none there is no value
otherwise we call ourselves recursively
and look up the same variable in our
parent environment so these lines
represent the correct code but let's say
I make a mistake and I do the following
implementation when it comes time to
look up a variable in the environment if
it's in my environment I give you the
answer otherwise I return none I never
ask the parent we know this is above
because I'm making a big deal about it
but it's easy to make mistakes when
you're writing the code on your own
let's remember this mistake that I'm not
going to look in my parent frame all
right so let's go through this program
and get a feeling for what it should be
in our mind a is 1 and we call mistletoe
with five so Baldur has the value five
now I assign it we look up the old value
5 plus 1 is 6 so now Baldur is 6a gets a
plus 2 so 1 plus two is three so our
variables are 6 and 3
alder get six plus three so Balder is
nine so the answer should be nine
however with the bug we're going to get
an error because at some point we'll try
to look up this variable a and it won't
be in our current environment frame
current environment frame only has
Balder and instead of looking it up in
our parent frame we'll just return none
and then we'll try to add none two
numbers and we'll get the wrong result
we will be super sad Balder was a God in
Norse mythology so beautiful so perfect
that as a child his mother asked all of
the other things in the world to promise
not to hurt him that's quite the
protection deal but she forgot to ask
mistletoe so everything in the world
bounced off Balder except for mistletoe
and in one of the stories in Norse
mythology it's variously told different
ways Loki the trickster god convinced
another God to throw mistletoe at Balder
actually a common element in the story
is that they were having fun by chucking
things at him throwing rocks they just
bounced off or whatnot that's a little
morbid but I guess if you're
invulnerable could be fun the person
being asked to throw didn't understand
the situation through the mistletoe at
Balder killing Balder very sad in fact
Balderas sometimes compared and
contrasted to Achilles in Greek
mythology who famously was invulnerable
in all parts of his body except the heel
so anyway this should this program
should print nine but instead it's going
to raise an error let's say we don't
know where the bug is we don't know it's
an environment look up what can we do to
refine this test case so that it more
closely points to exactly what's going
on well a common approach is actually
just to comment outlines in your test
case and see if it still breaks for
example if I comment out these three
lines in my test case so that mistletoe
just returns Balder we expect to write
five and we will so now we know the bug
is triggered or the problem lies in one
of these three lines this is sometimes
called fault localization because we're
trying to zoom in on localize where the
problem is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
