class variables let's move on to another
idea in object-oriented programming
which is that in Python all classes come
with some pre-existing class variables
one of them is called doc now this
variable has got underscores on both
sides of its name let's see this
variable in action so here I am at the
Python shell window with the Python
prompt and I can type a program in here
like 2+2 and it gives me the correct
answer now I want us to recall this
class called turtle that we had used
some time back while drawing shapes so I
can just import that class turtle here
there then let me see what happens when
I use the class name turtle dot turtle
I remember this was the name of the
module or the file and this was the
class name so if I use the class name
with the prepackaged variable called doc
let me see what it prints out aha I get
some documentation on the class turtle
now I wonder if I can use this variable
doc with my class movie so I'm back to
the code for the class movie and behind
this file is my other Python file where
I'm defining a whole bunch of instances
of class movie let me go back to the
code for class movie here for a second
now here I'm going to add some
documentation at the beginning of the
class movie you may have noticed that I
use triple quotes to define my
documentation now what I can do with
triple quotes is I can create
documentation in multiple lines for now
I just have the one line so I'm going to
save this file and then go to my other
Python file and here I'm going to scroll
all the way to the bottom and comment
out any sort of print statements there
now I will try to print out my class
movie which is accessed by saying media
dot movie I will try to print out its
documentation there let me save and run
this file and there it is the
documentation for my class movie notice
how I accessed it though I accessed it
using my class name which is movie and a
predefined class variable called duck
so now that we have successfully used
this variable called dock I have a
question for you you know much like the
variable dock Python has a few more
predefined variables these include the
variable name and module by the way more
information about these is also
available through links in the
instructor notes what I want you to do
is read through the documentation in the
instructor notes and then I want you to
use these variables name and module in a
new program once you have done that
please come back to the screen and check
this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
