is to do extreme values so in some sense
this is kind of an extreme value we're
testing one hand against itself but
there are other types of extreme values
what if the list of hands that's passed
to poker has only one item or zero items
or 100 items well pokers not usually
played as solitaire so there wouldn't be
much point in having one but nothing in
the specification rules it out so add a
test that checks when one hand plays
that that one hand is the winner
now what about zero hands the
specification doesn't say but it does
say that the function poker is supposed
to return a hand and if we pass it a
list with nothing in it then there's no
hand to return so I think the best thing
to do is to make it clear that when
we're past zero hand that that's going
to be an error if you wanted to you
could return the value none that might
be a reasonable thing to return but I
think the best thing to do is just to
say that that's an error and we also
want to have extreme values what if a
hundred people are playing poker at once
if hands is a list of a hundred
different hands we want to allow that
too it would be unusual and we need a
big deck of cards with 500 cards but it
could be done so I want you to write
tests to check for one player and to
check for 100 players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
