the question what happens when an
application requests a virtual address
that's not mapped physical memory but it
is somewhere on disk I'll represent a
user's process like so and at some point
he uses a virtual memory address that's
not actually mapped to physical memory
at the moment
yikes actually it's not that big a deal
an exception is raised which sets the
running process back to be ready to
repeat the instruction that created the
fault
meanwhile the operating systems page
fault handler takes over to address the
problem he checks to make sure the
request is actually valid and says it
sends a seg fault if it isn't then he
loads the desired page into memory gets
everything ready and then tells the
scheduler that the process is ready to
resume the process will execute its
memory move or read or whatever it is
again and this time it will succeed
because the page has been loaded into
memory and it can continue running
that's the high level picture let's talk
a little bit more about what the page
fault handler does so assuming that the
page we want really does reside on disk
the first thing the page handler does is
to find a physical page frame in memory
to load the data into the best scenario
is that one is free the handler keeps a
list of free pages if this is not empty
then you can just pop one off yeah and
that makes us very happy if he doesn't
have a free page however then he must
choose a page for replacement there are
many possible page replacement
algorithms we won't go into them here
for our purposes it suffice us to say
that a page handler will pick a page
that it doesn't think is likely to be
used soon this page is saved to disk and
then it's physical memory can store the
page that was created by the page fault
so one way or another we now have a free
physical page in memory to which we can
write the data we need from disk then we
update the processes page table and any
other data structures that are page
fault handler needs to keep track of and
then we're ready to restart the process
and let it continue on its way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
