is what are the goals that is with
respect to these complexity measures
what makes an algorithm good what you
want is actually pretty simple the first
goal is work optimality that is your
two-level algorithm should do the same
asymptotic work as the best Ram
algorithm here w star is intended to
mark the work of the best Ram algorithm
that is the one that doesn't have a
memory hierarchy the statement is no
different from what you would say about
parallel algorithms namely don't blow up
the asymptotic work kaboom there's a
second goal you want an algorithm that
achieves high computational intensity
here's a more formal statement
computational intensity or just
intensity is just the ratio of work two
words transferred I'll denote it by a
capital I intensity has units of
operations per word operations per word
put another way computational intensity
measures the data reuse of your
algorithm if this ratio is large it
means you're doing more operations for
every word that you transfer too fast
memory that's a good thing but you don't
want an algorithm that maximizes this
ratio at the expense of sub optimal work
in other words goals one and two go
hand-in-hand and i hope this fact
reminds you of work and span</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
