affect performance well note the
sequence of steps here when we encounter
the script tag we have to pause Dom
construction and let JavaScript run
before we could continue javascript is
set to be parser blocking because of
blocks Dom construction when we
encounter the script tag I see but that
doesn't seem like that big of a deal
javascript is pretty fast right it is
but let me make a slight modification
instead of using an inline script like
what we have here on the bottom let's
say we move the script contents into an
external file like what we have here
what would you expect to happen now hmm
well same as before
the parser finds a script tag fetches
the file and executed oh wait oh I see
this fish could take a while right and
while the browser is fetching this file
the browser's blocked and can't continue
constructing the Dom which would in turn
slow down the critical rendering path
exactly the script tag blocks the parser
from proceeding and were stuck waiting
for this file not a good outcome
so if external javascript always blocks
the parser it sounds like I should just
inline all of my JavaScript well yes and
no you're right in that in lining the
JavaScript would help eliminate the
request but there's some downsides as
well for example if you use the same
code on multiple pages then that would
be redundant code in all those pages so
there are trade-offs here all right but
for code that's specific to one page
that seems like a pretty good strategy
yeah that's reasonable but let's take a
look at some of the trade-offs and the
gotchas associated with them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
