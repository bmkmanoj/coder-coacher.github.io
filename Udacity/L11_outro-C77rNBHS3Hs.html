lesson well one idea is that good
algorithms are work optimal and have low
span imagine that a dag is a person
where dependencies go from head to toe
now a good algorithm is a person who has
low mass and is short and really wide
rather than being say really massive
super tall and super skinny now a
related idea is the concept of weak
scalability to see if you understand
this concept here's an exercise go and
read about this thing called um dolls
law which you might already know from a
different Udacity course then ask
yourself self what's the relationship
between Amdahl's law and this week
scalability concept a second big idea in
this lesson is divide and conquer which
you know and love from sequential
computing and it's an excellent tool and
paradigm for thinking about parallel
algorithms as well now in your toolbox
of algorithmic tricks it should often be
the first thing you try the last big
idea is to separate how you express
concurrency from how you execute it now
this is a really neat idea which makes
it possible to get truly elegant
algorithms unfortunately this model also
ignores communication which it turns out
is absolutely necessary to be fast and
scalable at least once the problem size
and the system size get big enough to
model communication you're going to need
some other abstract models but for now
let's just see how far we can take
dynamic multi-threading</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
