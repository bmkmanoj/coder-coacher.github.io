questions we've had yet we have one
allele of the lactase enhancer that
correlates with decreased lactase we
have another allele that correlates with
increased lactase but we see this an
adult we don't see this correlation in
babies right in infants all babies all
infants have the ability to produce
lactase and metabolize lactose so what
would be one of the reasons why we only
see this correlation in adults in not
infants why is it that all infants can
metabolize lactose they produce enough
lactase but it changes in adults the
best answer to this is that there's more
activator protein in the infant than in
the adult right this is how infants
overcome any lactose insufficiency it
doesn't matter if they're allele is
inefficient or less efficient because
they have a lot more activator protein
to bind the enhancer and promote
transcription of lactase but over time
as the babies grow into adults there's
less of that activator around and so
with only a little bit of activator
around you need to have a really
efficient enhancer to grab that
activator and promote transcription and
so if you have less activator around the
inefficiencies in the enhancers for the
lactase gene are going to become more
apparent which is what we see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
