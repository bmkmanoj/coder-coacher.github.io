equals 2x minus 3 over 5 I've gone
through the same steps that you become
very familiar with during this lesson
first I switched from f of X to Y to
make a notation easier to handle then to
switch to the inverse function I
interchanged x and y so instead we have
the function x equals 2y minus 3 over 5
then I went through a few steps to solve
for y getting y by itself on one side
gave us the equation 5x plus 3 over 2
equals y then I just switched the two
sides of the equation and changed why to
F inverse of X that gives us a final
equation of F inverse of X equals 5x
plus 3 over 2 let's double check that
this is the right answer remember we can
do that by looking at the composition of
F inverse and F and the composition of F
and F inverse F of F inverse of X is 2
times the quantity 5x plus 3 over 2
minus 3 all over 5 let's simplify this
and sure enough we end up with X let's
try the composition the other way around
for F inverse of f of X we have 5 times
the quantity 2x minus 3 over 5 plus 3
all over 2 and sure enough cleaning this
up we get X as well we've now verified
that F inverse of X really is this
expression 5x plus 3 over 2 I hope at
this point you feel really comfortable
finding the inverses of different
functions and then checking that they
actually are their inverses remember
this also means that not only is 5x plus
3 over to the inverse of 2x minus 3 over
5 but 2x minus 3 over 5 is also the
inverse of this function they're
inverses of one another it's a two-way
relationship</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
