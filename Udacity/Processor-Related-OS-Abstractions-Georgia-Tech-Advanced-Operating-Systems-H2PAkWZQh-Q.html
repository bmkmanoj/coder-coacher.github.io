abstractions provided by an operating
system I'm sure that you may have heard
several different terms used in the
context of an operating system such as
program or a process or a thread and
tasks and so on let's understand these
terms a program is the memory footprint
that is created when you click on an
icon to launch an application on your
favorite platform so it is a static
image of the program loaded into the
memory a process on the other hand is a
program in execution that is the
operating system breathes life into the
program which is a static entity but
running the program on the CPU that is
by scheduling the program to run on the
processor the operating system gives
life to the program and the process is
the program in execution therefore a
process is the program plus the state of
the running program and yes the state of
the running program is not static it is
continuously evolving as the program
executes so these are the two important
abstractions related to the processor
program which is a static entity created
by the operating system when you launch
a program and process is the program in
execution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
