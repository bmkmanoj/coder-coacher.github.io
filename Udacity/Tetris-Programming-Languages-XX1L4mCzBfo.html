company that shall not be named I was
bored out of my mind and one of the
things that people at this company did
to pass the time was playing Tetris I
ended up liking this Tetris game so much
that I decided to try and write my own
version of it write a computer program
to play Tetris and if you haven't seen
it before Tetris is a Soviet falling
blocks puzzle game with a number of
different pieces all of which are made
up of four smaller blocks I decided that
I wanted to support not just the normal
Tetris pieces but because i'm a bit of a
math person the ability to have pieces
that were five long as well in order to
do that i ended up making a piece
definition language a way of writing out
what a Tetris piece should look like
that this Tetris program would then read
in now I didn't use all of the lexing
and parsing techniques that you're going
to learn in this class but I did use the
same sort of concepts and the point I'm
trying to get across here is that in
some sense learning how to create your
own language is like learning how to
read it really opens up a world of
possibilities it's a new tool in your
belt that will come up and help you when
you least expect it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
