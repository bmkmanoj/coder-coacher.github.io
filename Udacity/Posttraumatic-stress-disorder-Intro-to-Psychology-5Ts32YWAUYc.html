disorder or PTSD experience many
intrusive symptoms that last at least
one month these include things such as
recurring intrusive thoughts feelings or
memories of the traumatic event this can
happen while awake or while dreaming a
person may experience flashbacks which
are vivid reactions that a person feels
when they're experiencing the traumatic
event over and over again people with
PTSD are easily startled with
hair-trigger temper 'z they may also be
reckless or self-destructive PTSD can
occur in both children and adults and as
we discussed in lesson 6 many veterans
experience PTSD in fact some research
shows that approximately 24% of War
veterans will experience PTSD these
veterans are also at greater risk of
developing major depression drug abuse
and suicide after returning home the
depth and despair of war induced PTSD is
seen in a suicide note from an Iraq war
veteran in 2007 Daniel Somers was
diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury
post-traumatic stress disorder gulf war
syndrome fibromyalgia and a host of
other medical problems he sought
treatment through therapy medication
music and film production but eventually
took his own life June 10th 2013 he left
behind a powerful suicide note here's
part of what it said all day every day a
screaming agony in every nerve ending in
my body it's nothing short of torture my
mind is a wasteland filled with visions
of incredible horror unceasing
depression and crippling anxiety
thankfully there are treatments
available for PTSD which we're going to
talk about in our next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
