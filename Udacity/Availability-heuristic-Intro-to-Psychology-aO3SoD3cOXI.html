classic study in psychology that has to
do with availability heuristic and it
revolves around the question you were
just asked which is are we more likely
to die in airplanes or automobiles and
when people are asked this they tend to
overestimate the likelihood of dying in
an airplane and in fact the statistics
show just the opposite we're much more
likely to die in an automobile for
instance in the US about 30,000 people a
year will die in automobile crashes and
only about a hundred or so will die in
plane crashes so in fact planes are much
safer than automobiles so even though we
know these numbers we're still more
afraid of flying than driving why is
that well as it turns out there's a
thing called vividness and vividness is
related to availability and
accessibility so when we hear about a
plane crash it's horrific a lot of
people die all at once and that makes it
very vivid in our minds very accessible
very available so when we think about
flying versus driving we're more likely
to think of dying in a plane crash
because it's a vivid event and that's
availability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
