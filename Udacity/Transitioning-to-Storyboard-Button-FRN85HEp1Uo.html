button the way we did for the label
first let's make a little room for the
button by moving this label up a bit and
we'll need to open up our utilities pain
so we can drag in the button there we go
well we have this utilities paint on the
right open let's go ahead and set the
titles on this button label to do that
you're going to want to go to the
attributes inspector and then you can
see here's where our title gets set
we'll just say click and then for the
label let's just set its original text
20 let's close our utilities pain for
now and move this back to the center and
next up we're going to set the target
action on this button first up let's
open up our view controller file for a
little review on target actions recall
that the target action that we added
programmatically had three key
components its target which was self the
action which was the method increment
count and the event that would trigger
that action touch up inside so now we're
going to use storyboard to tie together
these same three pieces of information
but first we need to mark this method as
an IB action so that it actually shows
up in storyboard similar to how we did
with the label property and we can close
our assistant editor for now and focus
on storyboard and move this over a bit
and to set our target action first we
bring up the buttons pop up connections
menu go down to touch up inside drag to
our view controller and choose the
method we want art to be our action I'm
just going to remove that target action
really quick so I can show you how to
make it one other way using the canvas
view you can still get to this menu go
from touch up inside to the view
controller and then the method increment
count and you can see the three key
components of the target action let's go
ahead and run it so we can see it in
action and if we click on the button we
can see our count incrementing so that
ought to take care of click counter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
