website looks intense before you will be
able to write CSS code like this you
first need to understand the basic
building blocks that make up a single
CSS statement all CSS begins with what
is known as a rule set a rule set is
made up of two parts a selector which is
the code that selects the HTML elements
that you want a style in a declaration
block which is the code that describes
the Styles you want to apply to set HTML
declarations are the lines of code
written inside the curly braces as an
example let's look at this simple
unstyled web page on the Left I have my
web page and on the right I have my code
for the web page remember how the head
of the page is used for the meta
information about the site style is one
of the pieces of information that goes
inside the head anything that goes
inside these style tags is CSS for this
example I'll start by typing P followed
by some braces then color colon blue and
ending with a semicolon this P is our
selector it is telling the browser I
want to select all the P tags or
paragraph tags on the page the code
inside the curly braces is our
declaration
it reads color colon blue semicolon in
this line color is the property we want
to change and blue is the value we want
to pass to it this is how CSS works for
every property you pass it a value like
blue and the value describes how the
browser should render the property for
the element properties are always
written in PI in English and they
identify a feature of an HTML element
that you want to change so let's see
what this page looks like after I add
this CSS I'll just save and let me go
refresh my page and wallah there you go
when I added the CSS to the web page the
color of the font and the paragraph tags
change to blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
