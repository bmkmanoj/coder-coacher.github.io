let's suppose that you would like to
visit a particular website to do so you
first need to issue a DNS query now the
authoritative DNS server for a
particular domain might be located in a
distant network as we've discussed in
previous lessons the DNS uses a
hierarchy to direct your query to the
location of the authoritative name
server but ultimately that authoritative
name server has an IP address and you
use the internets routing protocol the
border gateway protocol to reach that IP
address what if an attacker were running
a rogue DNS server and wanted to hijack
your DNS query or to return a false IP
address well the attacker might use BGP
to advertise a route for the IP prefix
that contains that authoritative DNS
server and suddenly your DNS queries
which were previously going to the
legitimate server are instead redirected
to the rogue DNS server so we might
think of this as an attack whereby an
attacker can use the BGP infrastructure
to hijack a DNS query and masquerade as
a legitimate service it can get even
worse than this let's now look at how a
BGP route hijack can result in a
man-in-the-middle attack whereby your
traffic ultimately reaches the correct
destination but the attacker
successfully inserts themselves on the
path the problem with this particular
route hijack attack is that all traffic
destined for IP X is going ahead for the
attacker even the traffic from the
legitimate network what we'd like to
instead have happen is that traffic for
IPX first goes to the hijacked location
and then goes to the legitimate location
so the attacker effectively becomes a
man in the middle the problem is that we
need to somehow disrupt the routes to
the rest of the internet while leaving
the routes between the attacker and the
legitimate location in
act so that traffic along this path can
still head towards the legitimate AAS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
