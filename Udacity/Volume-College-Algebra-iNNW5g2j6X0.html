do we hear all the time but in math that
has a special meaning just as we think
about it in everyday life volume is a
measure of space 3d space to be precise
so let's say I have a balloon like this
one right here it's not inflated right
now it's pretty flat not actually just
two dimensional but there's no air
inside of it right now to puff it up so
right now it's not really taking it very
much space however when you inflate a
balloon you increase its volume because
it takes up more space the volume of a
balloon is hard to calculate
mathematically the volume of a box is
pretty easy though let's take this box
for instance we can see that there are
three different links that we can talk
about with this box if I tilt it a
little bit you can see its height this
length right here you can also see the
width which I'm going to call this
dimension make it look at the length two
right here since this is kind of bulky
to work with right now I'm going to draw
my own rendition it on the tablet so
here is my very fancy drawing up a box
you can see I've labeled the length the
width and the height of the box the
three different measurements that we can
take of it with a ruler now for a box
the equation to find the volume is quite
simple the volume is just equal to the
length times the width times the height
in fact I'm going to go ahead and label
these sides with these abbreviations so
here we go one side length of l1 of W
and one of H</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
