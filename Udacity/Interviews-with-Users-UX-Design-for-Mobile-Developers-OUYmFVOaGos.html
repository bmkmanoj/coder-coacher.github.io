sound home and basically you're out of
the party or a store and the song comes
on anyway oh this song is awesome but I
don't know what it is and you pull out
the sound town it listens to a little
bit and it tells you it's jay-z and
Beyonce Bonnie and Clyde I can't think
of anything about it that really annoys
me if they couldn't prove it their songs
that it doesn't recognize like they're
building the library the whole time and
I'm sure yeah you know they can make it
faster but if say as they're building
their library later on and it recognizes
one of the songs I didn't recognize
earlier if it would just text me it'll
be like that song that you're listening
to eight months ago this is what it was
and then I that would be amazing I think
my favorite app is c2 5k and the C
sounds for couch potato and it's
basically where you if you have no
running experience it gets you up to
running 5k in eight weeks some of my
favorite features in this app is that
allows you to play music while you're
running and then whenever the app talks
to you it pauses the music so I never
have to worry about running over the
time that it allotted for me or anything
like that
it uses the playlists that are already
in my phone so if I create playlists
like I love Justin Timberlake so I have
a running Justin Timberlake playlist and
if I'm in the mood then I put that on or
if I'm into like some 90s music I have
my 90s running playlist so I love having
that option so one of my favorite apps
is Pinterest it's a service that allows
you to collect digital images you like
and put them into boards so there's very
various uses of it and personally I've
been trying to come up with the visual
theme for our website and I use that
board to collect different images on
robots cuz that's the thing theme we're
pursuing and I just put them into a
board and I can quickly see like
patterns and like things I like like in
one place so that that's very powerful
and I can use that for inspiration you
know I mobile on desktop across various
different platforms so an app that I
didn't like that I downloaded a while
back
I think he was called sleep bot and
basically uses an accelerometer to track
your movements as you sleep and it
figures out when how deep of a sleep
cycle you're in and wakes you up when
you're not in such a deep sleep cycle
it wasn't very reliable the way it works
is that you say you want to wake up
let's say at 6:30 and it'll either wake
you up up to 15 minutes before or up to
15 minutes after and that didn't always
happen it could have been an hour 2
hours or it would just never ring it's
not a good idea when you have a job so
last app I remember uninstalling I think
was called public by ksf it gave you
biking routes through the city so San
Francisco is a very hilly City and it
tells you like you're going here to here
take these streets so you don't have to
you know climb up this crazy hill and go
back down it but I can use my phone
while I'm on my bike so it was basically
just useless and really slow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
