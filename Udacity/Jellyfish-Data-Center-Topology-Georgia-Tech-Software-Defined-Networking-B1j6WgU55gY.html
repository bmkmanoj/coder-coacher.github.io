three a esas one two and three and that
each a s has a public/private key pair
let's assume that we have a network with
three a SS and that each AAS along the
path has a public/private key pair na s
can sign a message or a route with its
own private key and any other a s can
check that signature with the a esas
public key so let's suppose that a s1
advertises a route for prefix p so that
route would contain the prefix as well
as an address attestation which we're
not showing but let's look at the path
attestation so as usual the bgp
announcement would contain the prefix p
and the AAS path which so far is just
one and the path attestation which is
actually the path to one signed by the
private key of a s1 when as2 re
advertises that route announcement it of
course advertises the new a s path to
one it adds its own route at test
station three two one signed by its own
private key and it also includes the
original path attestation signed by a s1
a recipient of a route along this path
can thus verify every step of the a s
path as3 can use the first part of the
path attestation to verify that the path
in fact goes from s2 to s1 and does not
contain any other a SS in between it can
use the second part of the path
attestation to ensure that the path
between it as3 and the next hop is in
fact a s2 and that no other a esas could
have inserted themselves on the path
between two and three this is precisely
why the a s signs a path attestation
with not only its own part of the a s
path in the path attestation but also
the hop of the a s that is intended to
receive the BGP route advertisement to
see the importance of this part of the
path attestation suppose
that these guesses were not there in the
path attestation this case we have a
very nice well-formed BGP route
advertisement for a prefix with the AAS
path suffix 21 and we have each segment
signed so an attacker could in fact take
such an announcement and advertise
substrings of this route advertisement
as their own thus an attacker as4 could
claim that it was connected to prefix p
via a s1 when in fact no such link
existed simply by stealing or replaying
the path attestation one that's signed
by k1 but note that in reality a s1
never generates this signature in fact
it generates the signature 21 or in this
case it would somehow have to generate
the signature for one signed by a s
one's private key whereas if a s1 only
signed a message with its own a s in the
message such a segment or attestation
could easily be replayed there's
actually no way that a s4 could forge
the path attestation for one signed by a
s one's private key because it doesn't
own this private key and a s1 never
generated a path attestation with this
particular signed path this is the
reason that each a s not only signs a
path attestation with its own a s on the
a s path but also the next a s along the
path this particular mode of signing not
only prevents the type of hijacking that
we explored but it also prevents path
shortening attacks for example when a s4
receives the legitimate route to a SP
through the path three two one it would
be impossible for the a s to shorten
that advertisement to say 31 because it
would somehow have to generate a path
attestation for 31 signed by its own
secret key however if it did that the
receiving a s would look for another
path attestation with just 31 signed by
a s3 yet
shapath a test station would not
actually exist so these paths
attestations can prevent against some
kinds of hijacks as we've seen they can
prevent against these paths shortening
attacks and they can also prevent
against modification of the a s path
however there are certain attacks that
path attestations cannot defend against
so if an a.s fails to advertise a route
or our route withdrawal there's no way
for the path attestation or BGP sec to
prevent from that kind of attack certain
types of replay attacks such as a
premature riad vert Iseman of a
withdrawn route also cannot be defended
against and of course there is no way to
actually guarantee that the data traffic
travels along the advertised a s path
which is a significant weakness of BGP
that is yet to be solved by any routing
protocol</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
