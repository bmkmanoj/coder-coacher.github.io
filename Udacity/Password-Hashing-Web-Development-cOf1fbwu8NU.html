about how to use hashing and and the
HTML variant of hashing to make cookies
that won't be tampered with let's talk
about using passwords for hashing so say
we have a table for users in our
database and this table has a couple
columns one column is for the user's
name and another column is for the
user's password if we wanted to verify a
user is valid we might have a function
that looks like this you know this would
be called when somebody logs in and it
probably say like user you know equals
get user where this is some function
that gets the user from the database and
then we'd say you know so if this user
exists and this user's password equals
PW what was passed in return user and
that's and that's simple enough now the
problem with this approach is that if
your database gets compromised
you are in trouble you gave away all of
your users passwords which means not
only are your users angry because you
compromised their privacy your website
is in trouble because you've got bad
guys logging in screwing around with all
people's accounts because they know
everybody's passwords so that's a really
bad situation
so what we want to do is instead of
storing these plaintext passwords in our
database we'll store a password hash in
our database so we'll have H of hunter 2
and H of Metallica and if our database
gets compromised all the attacker has is
a bunch of a bunch of password hashes
and you know it's very very difficult
basically impossible to turn the hash of
this into the actual input parameter
this this function changes a little bit
so instead of just comparing PW to the
password field in the database we
compare hash of PW to the password hash
in the database and all of a sudden
we're in a much better situation this
takes very little work and your database
doesn't have any plaintext passwords in
it and if your database does get
compromised all the attacker has is a
bunch of hashes and not a bunch of
valuable passwords so this is a very
important strategy that you should
employ when building user registration
systems such as in this week's homework
but before we get there let's do a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
