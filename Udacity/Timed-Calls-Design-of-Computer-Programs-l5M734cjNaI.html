built the function called timed calls
with the plural s rather than a single
time call and it takes a number n saying
repeat this timing end times and then it
takes the function in the arguments to
apply to it builds up a list of the time
calls it throwaways the results and just
takes the time and then returns three
values the minimum of the times average
of the times and the maximum of the
times and from those you can do whatever
statistical analysis you want to do in
order to get a better feeling for what
the timing is like now if the function
runs very quickly you know say if the
function took hundreds of a second then
you might want to give n of a thousand
or so if the function takes about a
second to run maybe you don't want to
wait that long and maybe you want to
give a smaller value of n so part of the
problem is if you have a good idea how
long the function takes then you can be
precise about what a good value of n is
if you don't you don't know I'm going to
propose a different version of time
calls and this version has the same
signature as the three inputs and
returns them in average in max but this
time it treats n two different ways and
what we're going to do is say if n is an
integer then do the same thing we did
before but if N is a floating-point
number then what do we want to do is
keep on repeating Li called time calls
for the number of trials it takes until
we've added up to that number of seconds
if n is equal to the integer ten we
repeat ten times calls if n is in equal
to the floating point number ten point
zero then we repeat it until ten point
zero seconds have elapsed and here's a
hint we can ask if n is an integer and
then do one thing and if n is not an
integer then do the other see if you can
fill in that code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
