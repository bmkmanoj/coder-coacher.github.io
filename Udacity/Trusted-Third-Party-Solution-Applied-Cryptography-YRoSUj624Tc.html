two maybe the third so in the first case
trusty keys generated key a B that's the
key used to protect these messages so
any message over this channel that
trusty keys can intercept it can read
trusty keys can impersonate any customer
because it has a key shared with them
can generate a fake channel make it seem
like Alice's talking to Colleen but
pretend to be Colleen in that
communication and finally if there's a
malicious party see well maybe they
could tamper with messages along these
channels
I didn't provide enough details on what
we're using for encryption here and what
mode of operation is used in other
details to know whether or not that's
possible let's assume we could solve
this problem these other two are really
big problems and there's no way to solve
these if we're using a third party to
generate our keys we also haven't solved
the key distribution problem because we
still needed to set up all these shared
secret keys between trusty keys and
every other party so we haven't really
solved her problem this would only work
if everyone completely trusted trusty
keys which seems unlikely even with a
green box and if there was a secure way
for everyone to establish a shared
secret key with trusty keys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
