occurring in a state space here is the
initial state it is a goal state and the
state space consists of all of those
states that could be potentially
produced from the initial state by
iterative application of the various
operators in this micro world I want to
come up with a part in this state space
that takes me from initial state to the
goal state here is one path this is not
the only path but this is one path to go
from the initial state to the goal state
the question then becomes how might an
era agent derive this path that may take
it from the initial state to the goal
state let us see how this notion of
pathfinding applies to our blocks world
problem from the initial state here is
one part of going to the goal state
first we put see on the table then we
put be on top of C and then we put a on
top of B which is exactly the answer
that David had given this is one
sequence one path from the initial state
to the goal state the question then
becomes how does an AI method know what
operation to select in a given State
consider the state for example there are
several operations possible here one
could put C on top of B or B on top of a
how does the AI agent know which
operation to select at this particular
state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
