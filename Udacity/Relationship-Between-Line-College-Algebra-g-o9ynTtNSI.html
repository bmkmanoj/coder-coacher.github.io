form even though we have different
variable names now than we normally do
we talk about slope intercept form these
equations are both in the same form as y
equals MX plus B we have a variable on
one side a constant times a variable and
then a constant term tacked on to the
end this is true for this equation as
well because they are in slope-intercept
form we can just read off their slopes
from the equations directly both slopes
or point one so these lines are parallel
they do not have different slopes they
have the same slope that's what being
parallel means after all what changed we
move from the old situation to the new
situation with a surplus solution was
the G intercept we can find the G
intercept in each equation in the slot
where be normally is in slope intercept
form if I wanted to graph these pretty
informally on my little sketch up here I
would have our first line like this in
the second line exactly parallel to it
but just shift it up on the vertical
axis the information we use to create
the second equation then came from us
knowing the slope that this new line
should have and also one point that it
should go through 0 20 which we
reflected in the G intercept part of the
equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
