cognitive system we have come across
this several times earlier in this
course we can think in terms of three
different spaces a metacognitive space
and deliberative space in a reactive
space the reactive space directly math
percepts from the environment into
actions and the environment the
deliberative space Maps the percepts
into actions but in mapping is mediated
by reasoning and learning and memory so
while this is a see act cycle this is a
see think act cycle the metacognitive
space monitors the deliberative
reasoning it sees the deliberative
reasoning and act on the deliberative
reasoning as we had discussed earlier it
is better to think of these in terms of
overlapping spaces rather than disjoint
layers when we were discussing
metacognition we also saw that we could
draw arrow back from here like this
because metacognition could also act on
itself this cognitive system is situated
in the world it is getting many
different kinds of input from the world
percepts signals goals communication
with other agents depending on the input
and depending upon the resources
available to the agent to address that
input the agent may simply react to the
input and give an output in the form of
an action to a percept for example or
the agent may reason about the input and
then decide on an action after
consulting memory and perhaps in working
learning and reasoning in some cases the
input of the agent receives might be as
a result of the output he had given to a
prior input for example it may have
received a goal that come up with a plan
but it receives the input of the plan
failed upon execution in that case
deliberation can give an alternative
plan a metacognition may wonder about
why did the plan and fail in the first
place and repair the planner not just
the plan just like reaction and
deliberation is situated in the world
outside metacognition in a way situated
in the world inside it is acting on a
mental world while deliberation and
reaction act on the objects in the
external environment for metacognition
it is it hearts and the learning and the
reasoning that are objects
internally in the mental world of course
as input is coming constantly even now
as you and I are communicating both you
and I are receiving input and we're
giving output as well in fact it
cognitive system is constantly situated
in the world it is never separate from
the world there is no way to separate it
it is input coming constantly that is
output going out constantly the world is
constantly changing and the cognitive
system is constantly receiving
information over the world it uses its
knowledge and its knowledge structures
to make sense of data about the world
and it decides on actions to take on the
world recall that we had said that
intelligence is a function that map's
the perceptual history into action and
to some degree intelligence is about
action selection but selecting your
right output to act on the world
depending on the nature of the input the
output may vary if the input is a goal
the output might be a plan or an action
if the input is a piece of knowledge the
output might be internal to the
cognitive system recorded a system a
assimilate the acknowledged in its
internal structures if the input is a
percept the output might be an action
based on the present if the input is new
information the cognitive system and
learn from the new information and then
store the result of the learning in its
memory the word here consists not just
of the physical world but it is social
world as well does this cognitive system
is situated not just in the physical
world but is also situated in the social
world consisting of other cognitive
systems and Castlereagh interacts with
them once again the interactions between
these cognitive systems can be of many
different kinds percepts goals actions
plans information data any cognitive
system is not just monitoring and
observing the physical world it is also
monitoring and observing this social
world the actions of other cognitive
systems in the world for example any
coordinate system learns not just from
its own actions but also from the
actions of other cognitive systems
around it there's a cognitive system
needs to make sense not just to the
physical world but also by the social
world we saw some of this when we were
talking about scripts there we saw how a
cognitive system used a script to make
sense of the actions of other cognitive
systems
this architecture is not merely an
architecture for building air agents it
is also an architecture for reflecting
on human cognition does this architect
should explain large portions of human
behavior</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
