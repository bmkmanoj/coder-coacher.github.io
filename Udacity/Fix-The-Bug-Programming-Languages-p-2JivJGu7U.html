count works correctly
however there is a bug in my horizontal
checker here's what we're gonna do we're
gonna figure out the number of rows in
the board and store that in the variable
size for every row in 0 to size minus 1
know I'm gonna use functional
programming again here's what I'm going
to do to figure out if a number is
unique or not I'm going to use map to
convert every element of the row into
its count in that row let me show you
how that would play out suppose our row
is 5 6 6 7 after the map it's going to
be 1 2 2 1 because I've mapped every
element of this list to its count in
that same list we've used map before to
map strings to their lengths or map X 2
x squared but you can use map to do more
complicated calculations just like I'm
doing here so I'm going to convert every
one of these numbers 5 6 and 7 to its
count and then check and see if the
count is less than or equal to 1 so this
will become true false false true and
what I really want is for every element
in this list to be true that would
correspond to each element occurring
having a count of at most 1 there's a
Python procedure called all that given a
list returns true if every element of
that list is true I'm using that to
check that every element in my row had a
count of 1 or less and I'm doing it all
on 2 lines this is pretty slick but it's
also pretty complicated it's very
concise code but it might be harder to
read especially if you're not familiar
with all or map or making functions in
Python we've had less experience with
them in this class this problem is
intentionally difficult so what I want
to do is go over every row in the board
and check to make sure that for every
number in that row its count is less
than or equal to 1 and then that's true
for all the numbers on that board if you
were writing horizontal checker yourself
you might use a number of nested for
loops maybe even 3 nested for loops I'm
not writing as many for loops because
things like map and all and count do
them for me anyway if it's not the
case that everything is true then we
return false if I make it all the way
through here then we return true and
I've even made some test cases down here
I've got a good board one two three four
five six seven eight nine and a bad
board one one one four five six seven
eight nine and one my when I run my
horizontal checker on them the first one
passes because across every row all the
elements are unique but the second one
fails over here one one one one one one
one one one we've got a lot of
repetition there that fails our checker
unfortunately my code has a bug and
here's a board that shows it off I've
already made the test case for you one
two three that's looking good
horizontally everything is unique
four four four that's looking bad this
is not unique we should be returning
false and then seven eight nine that's
okay
we return true we think this board
checks out but it doesn't what I would
like you to do is define and submit via
the interpreter your own version of
Horace checker that's very very similar
to mine but just changes one or two
words to fix it fix the bug submit a new
version of Horace checker it should
still use all and map and lambda and all
that good stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
