this where you're setting an
eventlistener after the event has
already fired what happens nothing if
this event doesn't fire again then this
event listener never gets called now
imagine you're using promises and you
set an action to occur when a promise
resolves here which is after the promise
has already resolved guess what this
will execute compare this to the event
listener example where the event
listener would never get called if it's
set after the event already fired I want
to quickly show you some code this is a
promise constructor and you'll be
learning more about this in the next
video
this method resolve settles the promise
a promise can only settle once so in
this scenario the second resolve is
doing nothing nothing's going to happen
it's going to go by unnoticed compare
this two events an event can fire many
times but a promise can only settle once
promises execute in the main thread
which means that they are still
potentially blocking if the work that
happens inside the promise takes a long
time there's still a chance it could
block the work the browser needs to do
to render the page if so the frame rate
of your app is going to suffer and
you'll probably hear your users complain
about Jake promises are not a pass for
safely executing long-running operations
there's simply a technique for deciding
what will happen when an asynchronous
task settles think of them as try-catch
wrappers around asynchronous work okay
it's time for a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
