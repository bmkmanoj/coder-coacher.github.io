week's introduction to programming
nanodegree webcast my name is Jonah I'm
a coach here at Udacity and then over in
Mountain View we have oh yeah I'm
Anthony also a coach here yeah cool
so we're today talking about HTML
validation CSS validation why I should
care about it and how to do it so first
off what is HTML validation so when
people first thought of HTML way back in
the dark ages of the 90s like oh we can
just write web pages but the thing is
everyone wrote web pages maybe slightly
differently there was a general idea of
like using HTML tags but then there are
certain conventions and things that not
everyone followed so people came
together and they decided on a set of
rules and if your web page met all these
requirements the rules
it was validated and if it didn't then
it didn't be validation maybe your what
the site still worked but you know it
had to meet all these standards in order
to be validated so why does that matter
I don't know what is why do you think
what HTML validation matters Anthony
what's sort of your perspective well I
think it I think it matters the same way
that programming style matters in any
language you know why why do you may
have to indent where you have to indent
and Python
so in Python you have turned every up to
indent because the code won't work but
that's born out of a convention that
came from C programming Java program
lots of other languages that say you
have an if statement you indent you have
a function definition you in death
ultimately those sorts of rules that
maybe don't change what what a piece of
code does those rules keep things
consistent and it keep make though more
readable for people regardless of
whether it says the same
thing to a computer I think an important
thing to keep in mind is that you're
always writing code for other people as
well as your writing definitely yeah so
that's that's actually a huge part of it
is that making things easier to read is
important and also like professionalism
there's also a really important thing
like imagine your website is like resume
or something and you send it in to
someone and you know if you're applying
to a technical position they might look
at your source code and be like oh
you're indentation is all off you have
tags that aren't closed properly and
maybe your website looks fine but if if
you have these little errors here in
there it shows that you know you're not
careful about your code so it's it's
really important for those are the
situations as well
all right so have a couple questions
and Peter yes you're in the right spot
for HTML validation CSS validation we're
going to talk about today and then for
IBG hope I'm pronouncing that right the
eye candy just works you know you go
through the course on Udacity website
you'll be submitting projects if you
want to interact with the course
instructors you can schedule one-on-ones
through our website and we'll talk with
you one-on-one and help you through
reviewing your code answering confusions
and questions and whenever you submit
your projects you'll get feedback on
whether you meet requirements or not and
if you have further questions you can
ask us in the side window so let's dive
in yes sorry and then let's see some
HTML yeah so that actually I used one
that you've created I'm gonna start
sharing my screen
okay where is it
great oh and everybody's seen my screen
the image is black right now but
sometimes needs a second no I'm just
saying a black screen black screen okay
mm-hmm let me stop screen sharing and
start again all right
see me no you don't how about out they
don't just a black screen over here okay
let me try sharing the whole screen yeah
no no thank you
I'm also not seeing you when you stop
screen sharing that's weird
yeah I've never seen that before hmm you
see me huh nope see my screen now nope
and anyone who's watching see my screen
that's not Anthony
that's an issue what happened you're
alive
hi Anthony I'm gonna close out this
window you mean time we can entertain
our students I'll be right back
all right you're back that was weird
oh but we can't hear you
that's for a googol hanger by the week
it's getting bad all right come on out
yep I can hear you all right I guess
there's two of us yeah your your evil
clone decide I'll be doing - it's
probably what's causing this whole thing
all right so you see my screen now yep
there it is me turn my notifications oh
all right so we have this HTML which
Anthony you might recognize and actually
it looks fine so far
you know Arial black colors are showing
up tags look mostly right but it's a
different story and we validate it so
it's pretty simple deduce if you want to
validate some HTML you want to just
select everything copy it so copy and
then we'll go to our best friend
the w3c validator
okay and we will validate by direct
input which means we're just going to
type directly in but instead typing we
just copy and paste everything and I'll
check it so I actually went through and
completely mess this up so you'll notice
that when we validated it we have a
bunch of errors all right 23 of them
yeah yeah nice so it's really nice you
can go through this and you'll see that
every other it gets highlighted here and
we're gonna go through and explain what
these are one by one okay so the first
one they see is element ul is not
allowed as child element of ul in this
context so this means is you have this
tag which is unordered list that right
Anthony yep so if you look bulleted list
doesn't have numbered unordered exactly
so if you want to create a list you do
this and then you do like Li Li is
elements of that list and then sometimes
I see us a lot students will try to
create a list within the list that's
fine but you have to create it as a
child of Li so let's go let's go to R so
this is on line 24 so go to lion
actually let's do this this cool all
right actually that's not good let's not
do that hide that tree view you can hide
the sidebar that helps that's enough
cool so let's look at line 24 and we see
there's UL here and that's the culprit
but if you want to create another
unordered list within a list element
best to do it within
another list element so we'll create a
li UL here and it really helps if you
indent things then you want to create
another list in there like this is a
deeper level
exception okay and then close those tags
and that's how you get lists within a
list you don't want to just throw you
else really newly annexed you end up
having problems so that fixes that one
hopefully I think but I think like it's
a it sort of makes sense when you think
that lists only children could be list
elements right yeah and then and then
just remember whose list elements could
contain whatever you want right exactly
yeah let's go let's go ahead way of
putting it cuz these these are the
children unless our list is very picky
about its children it can't be anything
but other list elements it's like it
really means stepparent and yeah but if
you have another list inside that list
element they'll take whatever you can
put like images in here you know don't
do that but you can
so for wine clean 8 we have another
issue here and actually I messed
everything up because I put some new
lines in so I'm gonna revalidate this
stuff
okay cool so now I have a bunch of
different ones so I fixed all those and
we have some new areas cropping up
you'll see this happen you'll fix one
error and maybe something that was
depending on it goes wrong or something
goes right and they'll end up fixing
itself but now we see you don't have any
errors until I'm 116 good thing about
like the logic of code and especially
email validation like things can depend
on your unintended bugs which yeah and
other bugs
it's a weird phenomena so we have some I
think we have some questions here where
are those from before so there before
that's just David and Peter saying they
couldn't see you okay cool
just close that out all right so now we
saw left angle bracket when expecting an
attribute name probable cause missing
right angle bracket so sometimes they'll
give you suggestions of what's going
wrong and that looks like that is an
issue we are missing the right angle
bracket here so HTML is really I think
you need to make sure that everything
has angle brackets properly put in and
you know make sure that every tag that
you open is closed unless it's the kind
of element that doesn't need to be
closed what's an example it's an example
of an element I guess image tags image
tags the line break tag I think those
are the common ones yeah yeah that's
about that though so we fixed that and
then on line 16 we have slashes not
immediately followed by a right angle
bracket that was probably the same error
as before and then we have this error
and tag have attributes like we don't
really understand what's going on at
this point but we can assume that all
the errors can be were fixed by that
little bracket cool
so I'm lines 172 we have element angle
not alive allowed us element of child P
in this context so down here cool so
right here I made some mistakes it's
pretty common you can't use angle
brackets as like notation if you want to
like talk about div tags like
specifically in your code you can't use
these
you have to use escape and characters do
you happen to know what escaping
characters are off the top your head is
it it says and lt for the less than
symbol oh and a semicolon usually after
the alt so you'll see it light up and
then G key for the greater than simple
answer yeah so that's how you want to
talk about angle brackets if you even if
you do just one it's gonna mess
everything up so don't do that you
notice like when Jonah types that less
than symbol that the colors kind of mess
up and that's because yeah you know you
sort of interpreting that using as a tag
name and that the other is a just a
weird things happen there's less than
ingredient symbols have special meanings
in the language do I have to if we want
to write them explicitly as a less than
or greater than symbol we need to write
it differently and you see that sort of
thing a lot in programming for various
called special meaning in different
languages yeah so HTML is its own set
your language escape characters is a
backslash and a lot of languages has
special meaning and I'm here to actually
write a backslash you write backslash
because the backslash special meaning
says interpret the next character
literally so you write the backslash to
say interpret the next character
literally and then the second backslash
is the backslash on what you want to
interpret literally that's weird
so you can say I'm glad I don't work in
those languages it's rich meat all right
so let's keep going
you have a bunch of errors left to go
cool so on the nine we have an error on
192 so okay
so it looks like I too saw quotes when
expecting an attribute named probable
cause equals missing immediately before
that's not quite right here because we
just made a different error our
attribute is in quotes so we want to
have our a minor in the terminology
right this is the attribute and this is
the value all right so you want to have
your attribute no quotes just you know
as a word and have it equals and then
the value and coats it can get kind of
frustrating sometimes like it's hard to
remember but once you do these a few
times the coloring helps you to so if
you notice this was yellow you want to
have your attributes be green and your
values be yellow the more you do this
message where the probable cause is not
correct which would happen with various
error messages since the determining in
error system like programmatically is
actually quite a difficult problem in
the validator or even in other languages
the trace back can make assumptions
about what's causing the error that just
might turn out to be wrong sort of like
when
subjects wrong in Microsoft where it
yeah it's ultimately you take the advice
but like it's up to you to like actually
determine the cause
yeah that's that's a really good point
the most valuable information here is
the line the line number beyond that the
best guess of the software is probably
wrong sometimes it's right but you don't
really have to think of yourself in
order to make these fixes you're just
one of the fun parts of debugging cool
that's my probable cause it's not 100
cause exactly probable because it's not
like like police probable cause for you
I don't know where the event for was
going um so 192 so I think this is the
same issue this is the same issue you
this is the same issue to see like we
have four errors coming from just a
couple of typos it's kind of these
errors can cascade and blow up and it's
revalidate the definitely I think it's
usually a good idea I think if you like
fix one problem like run things again
see what's going on yeah reveal new
information or information that you
didn't notice before
yep cool so we only have five errors now
which is great so online 239 says
straight end tag div so this looks like
it's just a stray like bracket or slash
so I want to have all your forward
slashes come before your tags in order
to close the tag so take that out let me
say end tag her body seen but there are
unclosed elements so this just means
that we end our home page but there's
gives or some other elements that
haven't been properly closed and those
come later on here we can see that we
have an unclothed div online - 19 - line
yeah - 19 so this div doesn't get closed
this these are kind of hard because you
don't know you kind of know what's in
here and this is where it's important to
indent your stuff because if this was
all the way over here then you don't
know if it's part of the upper div or if
it's part of the lower div and you can
sort of go through and search it but
it's really easy to look at it it's
visually invented so we look at - 19 so
there's concept you want to look toward
where the concept ends so it's here I
think so I think we're just missing that
div at this indentation level so you'll
notice that I hope to see there but like
now that'd be right that in you can see
there is a you can see how each closing
div is like coming back and indent to
the final level and there was the edge
between where you have that missing
close that was a nice clue as to like
where for an issue was yeah so keeping a
close your code clean and indented can
you know you could and they just saw
that without even you know analyzing it
that there was something missing and
something you can do that really helps
is tools selection wait hold on edit go
to edit then you go to Wow I'm
completely blanking on how to do this
line indent so is that right no that's
not right
that just indents everything one time
there's something to do Auto and then
they're definitely pack tools that allow
like help to invent your code better I
totally thought that sublime came with
the indenting tool but maybe I'm wrong
I've been using one using Adam there's a
cool package called Adam beautify okay
that if you if you apply that to your
code it just indents it all very nicely
it's another case these like Auto and
enters of like take their advice with a
grain of salt because if you have a
missing tag or something it can indent
your code incorrectly which could be
misleading all three into them but yeah
cool
so yeah let's say I mess up on my my
tags here and then I want to put him
back a lot of times it'll do it right
but maybe it won't sir
yeah use your eyes these are brain these
your heart and you'll notice sublime is
pretty cool in that if you have open div
and you want close it if I just type you
know bracket and then this chord slash
it'll fill it in I don't even have to do
it so I know that there's some open tips
and that looks like there's another open
div on wine 191 or is that the one we
just did no I did 219 191 is this div
class lesson so I think so concepts are
within lesson so once all that concepts
are over I think there's just an extra
missing div
here then on line 30 we have another
lesson so I'll go down once all these
concepts are over here are missing and
if pool so I think that's about right
let's reinvent this cool everything
stacks up nice I think if we copy and
paste this into here might have one
extra there at the end let's see what
the validator says yeah yep straight
untag all right here too many dudes you
can see how the indentation kind of
reveals at which point what's the big P
say actually something weird says
there's no errors but we're also missing
a closing HTML tag where you're missing
an HTML an opening HTML tag dude I don't
think you had one up at the top there
yeah so I guess values don't catch
everything so I'm out 5 maybe the HTML
tag is not necessary really it might be
possible via the doctype HTML on the
HTML tag are kind of a artifact of an
older age you might notice that like
pretty much any HTML page you write will
format this exact same way regardless of
whether you declare the doctype or
whether you have those surrounding HTML
tags they used to be like prior to HTML
5 which is the current version of HTML
there are many different flavors of HTML
and depending on which one you specified
the browser could interpret your page
very differently so if you look at some
like much older web pages you'll see doc
types that aren't just
standard like straight HTML interesting
don't refine a doctype and your browser
is like relatively new you're not
working on like I know Internet Explorer
6 or something yeah the browser will
assume your page is html5 and displayed
correctly
that being said usually a good idea to
put in a doctype and at least partly
because who knows when the standards
will change in the future that's true
and that can at least kind of
future-proof your web page a little bit
all right cool I think that's about it
validate early validate often and maybe
need some help post in the forums there
ask one of us in a one-on-one and yeah
thanks so much for coming guys see you
soon see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
