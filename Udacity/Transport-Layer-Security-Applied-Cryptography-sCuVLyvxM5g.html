about is called TLS which stands for
transport layer security it's also
sometimes referred to by its own name
which was SSL which was Secure Sockets
Layer
and this was a protocol that was
invented by Netscape in 1995 with the
goal of enabling clients meaning web
browsers and web servers to be able to
communicate securely this is really the
essential thing for creating ecommerce
if the protocol that among other things
allows people to send credit card
numbers over the Internet as well as
other personal information with some
confidence that it's going only to the
intended destination it consists of two
main parts the first is the handshake
protocol and that's used to authenticate
a server trail client it can be in both
directions it can also be used to
authenticate clients to servers the way
it's used on the web this rarely happens
this would require clients to have
public keys that would be known to the
servers the other outcomes of the
handshake protocol are agreement on the
cryptographic protocols to use TLS is a
very complex protocol that allows many
different encryption algorithms to be
used for different parts of it part of
the handshake is to agree on which ones
to use and the final thing is the
essential outcome for communication to
establish a shared session key a key
shared between the server and the client
the second part of the TLS protocol is
the TLS record protocol that's done
after the handshake to enable secure
communication between the client and the
server using the session key that they
established from the handshake the
question for this quiz is which one of
these two protocols is likely to involve
asymmetric cryptography
I haven't described the protocols yet
but based on what they do you should be
able to figure out which one is likely
to use asymmetric cryptography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
