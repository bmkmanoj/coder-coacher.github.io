the program it cannot find the file
specified you know that's really
interesting because at one point we were
able to find all of the files in fact we
printed out all of the file names ok
let's continue to read the error it says
that the error is in line and is
happening around OS dot rename this
makes me wonder if the program is
actually looking at the right folder
when it's trying to rename the files so
going back to our program I know there
is this function called OS get CWD CWD
stands for current working directory let
me save that in a variable and print it
and I will comment everything else out
for the time being let me save and run
it seems that the program's current
working directory is this folder called
or P which resides in the C Drive and if
I go back to my program I know that my
files on my photos are inside this
folder called prank which is inside Oh
Oh P which resides in the C Drive
no wonder the program can't find any of
the files it's looking inside o P
meanwhile all of the files are inside
prank to fix this I can use the change
directory function and with this
function I can ask the program to look
at the folder where my files actually
reside which is this folder right here
so I'm going to copy that and I'm going
to paste it here and then let me
uncomment some of the lines I had
commented out before towards the end of
the function I will change the path back
to how I found it let me save and run
the program one more time hmm the
program didn't quite throw an error this
time but now I want to check to see if
the files have actually been renamed so
here we are back at our folder and
you'll notice that the names of the
files don't have any numbers anymore
they've been renamed and if i zoom out a
little bit you will notice that the
photos will reveal a secret message
which is that the keys are in the closet
behind the shoebox
alright it seemed like a program worked
now before we finish this project my
final recommendation in terms of
improving it is to add a print statement
each time we change the name of a file
so here I am printing the old name of
the file and here is its new name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
