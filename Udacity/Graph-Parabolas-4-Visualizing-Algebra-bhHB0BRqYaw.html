excellent work if you figured it out we
want to start by factoring a negative 3
from these first two terms so we'll have
negative 3 times x squared minus 2x will
leave a space in order to complete the
square and then we'll have negative one
on the end the B value is negative 2
here so we need to add B over 2 squared
in order to complete the square B
divided by 2 equals negative 1 and this
number squared is positive 1 this means
we add one in order to have a perfect
square here but we really just an add
one here we really subtracted three
we'll have negative 3x squared here
positive 6x here and negative 3 here so
in order to make our equation balanced
we'll have to do the opposite of
negative 3 we'll have to add 3 to the
same side of the equation this is so
that we really add 0 we don't want to
change your equation we really just want
to leave it balanced we can rewrite this
as a perfect square writing X minus 1
squared to replace this trinomial the
factor of negative 3 stays in front and
then we combine negative 1 and positive
3 to get positive to this is our
equation in vertex form and we can see
that the vertex is H comma K positive 1
and positive to keep in mind if the Y
value were equal to 2 then that means
this entire expression would have to
equal zero which means the binomial X
minus one must equal 0 so we set it
equal to zero which means X would have
to equal one that's the x coordinate of
our vertex so we have this for our
vertex and then we can get to other
points by moving one left and one right
of the vertex and then three units down
we can see that more clearly here one
unit left and one unit right and then
three units down that's our a value so
we have the point 0 negative 1 on our
parabola and we have the point
2 comma negative 1 and again notice how
these two Y coordinates are three notes
less than our vertex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
