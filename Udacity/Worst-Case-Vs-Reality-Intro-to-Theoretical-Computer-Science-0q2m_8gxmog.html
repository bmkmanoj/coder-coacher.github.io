that this is of course just a worst-case
views so this is what you just
calculated here if we were to consider a
billion different possible solutions and
the numbers would of course get much
higher if we said we are ready to
consider 10 billion or 100 billion
possible solutions but still they would
not be in the thousands and that's
actually the surprising thing because if
we look how well those algorithms
perform in practice they perform
dramatically better so for independent
set and click you can usually solve
instances for over a thousand vertices
and 43 set there are even annual
competitions in which participants solve
instances with I would say almost in the
tens of thousands of variables this
varies by competition so there's some
competition where it's in the hundreds
and the thousands but you can solve
instances up to 10,000 and the reason
for that is that it seems like most of
the instances or inputs to NP complete
problems that we encounter and practice
are in a way well behaved they rarely
tend to be worst-case instances that
force our algorithms to run in their
maximum time and there's also besides
search trees other very interesting
techniques that you can use to further
improve your running time of your
algorithms and I would now like to
introduce to you pre-processing as
another technique to deal with NP
completeness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
