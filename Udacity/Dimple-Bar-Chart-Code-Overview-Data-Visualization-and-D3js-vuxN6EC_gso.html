load in the dimple J's library in
addition to d3 let's go to our text
editor and look at our template file
that we'll be working with as you can
see here it's a pretty standard HTML
file as you've seen in Lesson one and as
you can see at the top here we first
load in d3.js
from d3 site and the second script that
we're loading in is dimple J is from
dimple site now it may not seem like a
big deal but it's important that you put
the script to load the dimple library
right below the script to load d3s
library since d3 should be loaded before
dimple Jas gets loaded as you can see
here in the head of our webpage we have
the familiar draw function which will be
called when d3 loads and data and what
we have here is a bunch of code to
create a chart in dimple Jas I don't
want to go through this just yet but I
want to show you the structure of the
file we're working with and just at the
bottom here we have the familiar script
tags in the body which makes a standard
call to d3 to load in our tab separated
values file world-cup TSV and once our
data gets loaded we'll pass the data to
our draw function which we defined above</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
