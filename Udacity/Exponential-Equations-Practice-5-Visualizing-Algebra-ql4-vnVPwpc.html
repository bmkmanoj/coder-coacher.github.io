positive 7 now that's great work if you
got this one correct now there were two
ways to do this problem we could rewrite
these two bases with a base of 4 or we
could write these two bases with a base
of 2 i'll show you both methods but
first let's do the one with a base of 4
I know 16 is the same thing as 4 squared
and I also know 64 is the same thing as
4 cubed so we write each of these bases
with a base of 4 raised to a certain
power these other exponents stay on the
outside of the parentheses now we have a
power raised to another power which
means we can multiply these two powers
together the same is true on the right
hand side we have 4 to the 3rd raised 2x
plus 3 so i'll multiply this power by
this power here and i'll multiply this
power of three by the power x plus 3
notice too that i'm putting the power in
parentheses it's because i need to
distribute this 2 to both of these terms
the same is true for the three we
multiply the 3 by X and the three by
three distributing the 2 here and here
and distributing the 3 here and here we
get these powers now we have bases the
four and we can set these two exponents
equal to one another so we'll have 4x
plus 2 set equal to 3x plus 9 next we'll
subtract 3x from both sides of the
equation to get 1x plus 2 equals nine
then we'll subtract two from both sides
of the equation to get our answer of x
equal to 7 now the other way to do this
problem is to rewrite the base of 16 and
the base of 64 with powers of 2 16 is
equal to 2 to the 4th and 64 is equal to
2 to the six next we have powers raised
to powers on both sides of the equation
so we can multiply these two exponents
together here and we can multiply these
two exponents together here now we have
to raise to the 8x plus for distributing
this floor and we have to raise to the
six
+ 18 distributing this 6 now that both
bases are identical we set these
exponents equal to one another so we'll
have 8x plus 4 equal to 6x plus 18 we'll
subtract 6 X from both sides of the
equation to get 2x plus 4 equals 18 next
we'll subtract 4 from both sides to
isolate the 2x so 2 x will equal 14
finally we divide both sides by 2 to get
1x equals 7 our solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
