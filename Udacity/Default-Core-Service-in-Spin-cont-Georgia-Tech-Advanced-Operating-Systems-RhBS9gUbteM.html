resource which is another core service
namely the CPU Spain only decides at a
macro level the amount of time that is
given to a particular extension that's
done through the spin global scheduler
the global scheduler interacts with the
application threads package an
application is a loose term here it is
the extension that is living on top of
spin which may be an entire operating
system or maybe just an application for
example let's say we are running Linux
and Vista as two extensions on top of
spin each may be given a particular time
slice say of X milliseconds how each
extension uses the time that has been
given to it for scheduling user level
processes running inside the operating
system is entirely up to those
extensions and to support the concept of
threads in the operating system and
management of time spin provides an
abstraction called strand the actual
operating systems that extend spin will
have the threads map to strands so
strand is the unit of scheduling that
spins global scheduler uses but the
semantics of the strand is entirely
decided by the extension if for instance
I'm implementing P threads I will define
the semantics of the strand to be the
semantics of the petrous scheduler and
there are event handlers that help in
the scheduling that needs to happen in
the extensions and the kind of events
that spin provides for this course
service of CPU scheduling our block
unblock checkpoint and resume and the
extensions event handlers have to give
the semantic meaning of what needs to
happen when these event handlers are
called
because these are only interface
functions what needs to happen when this
interface function
is called is upto the extension for
example a disc interrupt handler may
result in an unblock event being raised
for a particular strand that was waiting
for the disc IO completion similarly if
an application were to make a system
call that is a blocking system call then
the service that provides that facility
to the application will raise this block
event which will result in the extension
taking the appropriate action of saving
the state of the currently running
process and putting it in the
appropriate cubes that it has to wait
for that system called completion so in
a nutshell what spin provides are
exactly the kind of primitives that may
be needed by an extension that wants to
provide the service of CPU scheduling
the spin only provides the interface
function definitions the semantics are
all up to the extension on how exactly
the scheduling is affected and all that
spend us is to ensure that the extension
gets time on the CPU through this global
scheduler that spin has for allocating
time to different extensions that may be
concurrently living on top of spent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
