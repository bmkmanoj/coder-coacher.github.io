the design of computer programs or cs2
one to this class is a follow up to CS
101 or the equivalent in this class you
will learn how to look at the
description of a problem and come up
with a good solution you will learn that
there are many choices along the way and
that some of these choices are just a
matter of taste and other choices have
important repercussions in short this
class is about setting you on the path
to developing good taste as a programmer
I hope you'll join me
that's a great question if you want to
be a world-class expert at anything
whether it's computer programming
playing the violin basketball whatever
it is gonna take years but that just
means it's a great time to get started
now and if you're deliberative and think
about what you're doing and keep on
practicing you can make a lot of
progress and in short a time is seven
weeks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
