out to fundraise they have to think
about it like I think getting married
you are about to bring somebody on both
to your business and that you can't undo
afterwards so once you bring onboard
investors it's not only just your
business and you have to acknowledge
that and you have to believe that that's
the right thing for you and that's the
right thing for the business if you can
bootstrap great if you don't have to
find ways great but for the vast
majority of businesses in today's tech
world you have to raise out go out and
raise money so the downside is perhaps
is that it's no longer your business I
actually think it can be a very good
thing because now you're accountable not
just to yourself but both for other
people as well and people that you know
put their trust and money in you and
that's I find to be a very invigorating
thing for a lot of entrepreneurs who
already are working super hard I
actually upping their game because they
appreciate the responsibility that comes
with raising capital</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
