generalization of this sort of problem
solving two n dimensions instead of just
the two that we've seen so far we can
write an optimization problem in a form
like this one in matrix form this
becomes maximize C transpose X such that
ax is at most B and X is non-negative
note that inequality when applied to
matrices means that it holds for each
element in the matrix when we first
encounter a linear programming
optimization problem it might not be in
this form in fact the only requirements
for an optimization being a linear
program is that both the objective
function and the constraints be linear
whether they're inequalities or
equality's if this is true then we can
always turn it into a canonical form
like this here are the key
transformations to convert a max problem
to a min problem or vice versa just
negate the vector C which contains the
coefficients for the objective function
thus max c transpose x becomes
minimizing negative C transpose X and
minimizing C transpose X becomes
maximizing negative C transpose X to
convert an upper bound to a lower bound
or vice versa in one of the constraints
we simply negate the inequality we can
convert an equality into two
inequalities by giving both an upper and
a lower bound constraint here I've
played the trick from transformation to
to make these both at most constraints
things get a little more interesting
when we go from one of the inequalities
tool inequality here we introduce a new
variable either a slack or a surplus
variable depending on the inequality
there's also the problem of free
variables that are allowed to be
negative there are two ways to cope with
one of these if it is involved in an
equality constraint then we can often
simply eliminate it through substitution
otherwise you can replace it with two
new non-negative variables and just
substitute the difference
