our grammar one way to get started with
this is to think about what's in chart
zero these two are in chart 0 T goes to
dot P Q R and T goes to dot beak us and
we haven't seen anything yet so if we
start from that in chart 0 the only
operation we can do is to shift to get
to chart position one shift over the
input p if that's actually the first
character of the input well it totally
is that's super convenient so we're
going to move these dots over here and
get T goes to P Q R and T goes to peak
us from zero in chart state 10 so both
of the first two are correct now we're
going to have dots in front of the queue
so we're going to bring in q goes to dot
Q from one in chart position one now
we're going to look at the input again
and see that the next token is actually
Q so we're going to shift over this and
put the result in chart too so in fact
this one's correct as well while we're
on a roll now the last to involve doing
reductions we see Q ghost a little Q and
we've seen all the input we need by the
time we're in chart State 2012 we've
seen two characters to the input so
we're going to go back to states that
had a dot in front of a big Q and say we
have found your big Q we're done with it
so chart one had a dot in front of a big
Q will conceptually shift over it and
chart 2 will now have that dot after the
big Q and another way to interpret this
is after seeing two characters in the
input we could be here well the first
character is P great and the second
character is little Q which we reduce up
to big Q so yeah this is totally where
we are my finger is right there starting
from zero with no more hidden tokens on
the left so in fact both of these are
also right we will do the reduction and
do this sort of pretend shifting for
this first rule and also for the second
rule in general we do
all the shifting all the reductions all
the closures possible well it's a good
thing we're going to have a computer
program do this for us because doing it
by hand is starting to get long this was
a particularly tricky quiz so don't feel
bad if you missed a few of these in the
end though all of them were right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
