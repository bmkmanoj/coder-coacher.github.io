student data we'll start with the data
wrangling phase that is acquiring and
cleaning the data and you'll pose a
question once you know what data you
have to work with data acquisition can
happen in a variety of ways in this case
you acquired the data by downloading
some files that were available in other
cases you might need to get the data
from an API or you might need to scrape
it from a webpage you'll also often need
to combine data from multiple different
formats now don't worry if some of these
terms are unfamiliar to you they'll be
covered in more depth in our data
wrangling course which is linked in the
instructor notes it's a great course if
you'd like to learn more about how to
get data from a variety of different
sources your files are in a format
called CSV which stands for comma
separated values a CSV file is similar
to a spreadsheet with no formulas the
CSV format is also very easy to process
using code unlike for example an xlsx
file which is the format used by
Microsoft Excel for example let's take a
look at one of your files which contains
student enrollments here's what the file
looks like in google spreadsheets there
is a row for each time a student enrolls
and columns for different pieces of
information such as the account key the
enrollment date and the cancellation
date if any now here is what the file
looks like if you open it in a plain
text editor a plain text editor is a
program like notepad or sublime that
shows exactly what is present in the
file as you can see the actual contents
of the file are very simple the header
row from the spreadsheet is present as
the first line of the CSV file the
second row of the spreadsheet is the
second line of the CSV and so on within
each row you'll see the first cell
followed by a comma followed by the
second cell followed by a comma and so
on
this makes CSV is very easy to process
in programming languages such as Python</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
