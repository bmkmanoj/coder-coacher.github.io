pretty well Michael how are things going
with you
good you know I'm excited to tell you
about neural networks today you may be
familiar with neural networks because
you have one in your head I do well yeah
I mean you have a network of neurons
like you know you know neurons like
brain cells I mean let me I'll draw you
one okay so this is my attempt at
drawing a nerve cell or neuron and
you've you know you've got billions and
billions of these inside your head and
they have you know most of them have a
pretty similar structure that there's
the there's the kind of the main part of
the cell called the cell body and then
there's this thing called an axon which
kind of is like a wire going forward to
a set of synapses which are kind of
little gaps between this neuron and some
other neuron and what happens is
information spike trains woo travel down
the axon when the cell body fires it has
an electrical impulse it travels down
the the axon and then causes across the
synapses excitation to occur on other
neurons which themselves can fire again
by setting out spike trains and so
they're very much a kind of a
computational unit and they're very very
complicated to a first approximation as
is often true of first approximations
they're very simple sort of by
definition to first approximation so
what in the field of artificial neural
networks we have kind of a cartoonish
version of the neuron and networks of
neurons and we actually put them
together to compute various things and
one of the nice things about the the way
that they're set up is that they can be
tuned or changed so that they fire under
different conditions and therefore
compute different things and they can be
trained through a learning process so
that's what we're going to talk through
if you haven't heard about this before
ok so we can replace this sort of
detailed version of a neuron with a very
abstracted away kind of notion of a
neuron and here's how it's going to work
is we're going to have inputs that are
kind of you know think of them as firing
rates or the strength of inputs X 1 X 2
X 3 in this case
those are multiplied by weights w1 w2 w3
correspondingly and so the weights kind
of turn up the gain or the sensitivity
of the neuron this unit to each of the
inputs respectively then what we're
going to do is we're going to sum them
up so we're going to sum over all the
inputs the strength of the input times
the weight and that's going to be the
activation then we're going to ask is
that greater than or equal to the firing
threshold and if it is then we're going
to say the output is 1 and if it's not
we're going to say the output is 0 so
this is a particular kind of neural net
unit called perceptron which is a very
sexy name because they had very sexy
names in the 50s when this was first
developed all right so this this whole
neuron concept gets boiled down to
something much simpler which is just a
linear sum followed by a threshold
threshold anopportunity kinds of Units
compute so let's see if we can figure
some of those things out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
