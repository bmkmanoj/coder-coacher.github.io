notebooks will probably need those two
entities let's start with a notebook we
will need the following attributes name
and creation date name will be a string
and creation date will be a date once
xcode turns notebook intraclass it will
also turn each of these attributes into
properties we can also configure the
attributes over here
optional specifies if this property must
always be present or not should a
notebook always have a creation date I'd
say yes validation rules allow you to
provide coordinated with constraints for
value for example if you have an
attribute called celery it should always
be greater than 0 therefore you should
set salary to have a minimum value of
zero core data will make sure you never
say value that is less than zero now go
ahead and create your own entity
notebook now let's move to the note
entity it will have the following
attributes creation date and text should
a note always have a creation date
yes so we'll set it as optional text
should it always have a text
well it might be empty so I would leave
it as optional this trans sign checkbox
here means that the property will not be
saved in core data i wouldn't use this
so we'll forget about it
now go ahead and create your own note
there's one thing missing here one
notebook will have several notes and
anode will have only one notebook
it's important to make sure that our
data model includes this information
will do this in the next video with
relationships</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
