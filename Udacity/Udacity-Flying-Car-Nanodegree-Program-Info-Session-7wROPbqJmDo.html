introduce the three instructors in this
course
Angela from Germany originally but at
Toronto now Angela had Steve dynamic
Systems lab at the Institute for
aerospace studies at the University of
Toronto and she's also the associate
director of the Center for a robotics
research in education I headed sheet
because it's Mabel is Lama in any other
title I've seen in my life so I'm
leading a team conducting research at
the interface of robotics controls and
machine learning and what this means is
we built robotic systems that can learn
from experience and from each other and
the goal is that they through that can
do tasks better operate more safely and
are generally more independent that's
exciting because like ten thousand
Amazon doors in the sky if this friend
learned something about the world all
the nine thousand at the same thing that
would be one of the ideas yeah that's
great Nick Nick Roy we've known each
other for a long time because we've
worked together at Carnegie Mellon
University but he's now professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and
needs to group of researchers in csail
MIT education thousands lay out what you
do well the first order I'm very lucky
to have a great group of students and
postdocs and I do PR and fundraising for
them more specifically what we what we
do is we look at a lot of related issues
to what angle it was mentioning issues
of vehicles how they navigate in
complicated cluttered environments when
you don't have external infrastructure
like GPS etc we look at the issues of
how these vehicles understand what's
happening around them especially in a
human centered environment they need to
be able to interpret what's happening
around them understand what people want
and make were safe and reliable
decisions no together rebuilding the
nanodegree program on flying cars and
flying cars is to be able to misnomer
it's not gonna look like a stallion
bumpers but the field of flying vehicles
has become incredibly hot in Silicon
Valley and around the world and I'm
super delighted we could attract two
super stellar professors to teach this
bit
program with us I wanna start with you
Angela tell us about how did he get an
involved in flying machines and
cooperative flying machines my
background was math I did a lot of
control theory and theorem proving and I
wanted to see this in action and flying
vehicles were just the first thing that
came up in 2008 so that's how I started
working with robotics and Nick you
started working on nursing-home robots
before you did anything flight
how did it happen for you well so after
I got my job offer at MIT I went home to
visit my parents with my wife and you go
into your bedroom and whether your
parents have kept all the things you had
to be growing up and Christine noticed
it was just rows and rows of books about
airplanes and the thing is is that when
I was a little kid I just loved
airplanes and aircraft and I used to
when we get stuck in traffic in
Vancouver
I'd bug my mother about like we should
really own a helicopter and so massively
impractical you know from a signal
suggestion from a six-year-old but the
thing is it's just something that's
always been super appealing to me about
you know 3d motion flying through the
air flying like birds and then after I
finished my PhD at Carnegie Mellon I had
the opportunity to come to MIT and take
a lot of the technologies that we've
been developing for ground vehicles and
put them in the air and it's just you
know it was like like coming back to the
thing that I had loved for so long when
I was a kid but got me back into this so
you gonna have a headache off this one
me personally yes well it's sad to say I
am both mechanically very non dexterous
and and you know the complexity of
flying these things is not something
that I personally am good at but I get
to work on the technologies that make
like a you know a dummy like me who
can't really fly these things actually
able to make them work my cell I not
only degree program really teaches us
students all the different components to
build drones to be cooperative drones to
build flying vehicles bigger ones that
you can sit on like drones you can sit
on and so on but I but one of the things
it's really remarkable is that this feat
has become incredibly hard in the last
two or three years I would say why
well so there's been two I think big
tectonic shifts one is that through a
variety of forces market forces
technology forces all of a sudden the
components are there to make very small
drones are a lot easier for ordinary
people to use so just like let the
cellphone industry in one sense is given
as the necessary technologies in terms
of batteries and computers in
electronics etc and the other is a major
regulatory shift in that the FAA has
been surprisingly active and progressive
in opening up the space for these kinds
of technologies so the confluence of
those two things together has produce
this like remarkable flourish and
community of enthusiasts and you you
live in Canada so it's not FAA it's a
different regulatory body but what
situation there so it's called Transport
Canada in Canada and for a while--
Transport Canada was more progressive
than in the u.s. so companies like
Amazon would come to Canada to test they
have been really supportive in general
for the research we have a conversation
and usually they make it work for us so
yeah I think they will support whatever
we develop as long as you can prove that
it's reasonably safe so Jeff Bezos from
Amazon was for the first two to make
this very public topic and of course
Google thanks to Nick who actually found
it and ran the Google link team which is
the Google drone team it's become a
topic of mainstream like this idea that
the sky is covered with drones that
bring your Amazon packages and have you
or even people in case of Kittyhawk how
how real is this this is something we
should think about today I think we
should think about this today they are
still quite a bit of work to be done but
as researchers we have been working on
the controls and safety aspects for a
long time and also incorporating machine
learning to improve safety the thing is
going to happen soon well in some sense
it's already happening that's you know
little drones are being used to do
things like take pictures of people's
houses for real estate their
infrastructure inspection when I was
living here in
a couple of years ago as you said
founding project wing we could drive my
son to school and we drive across the
Dumbarton bridge and there's a series of
power lines that we would see a human
being
hanging from a giant helicopter I mean
giant relatives a little drones a normal
sized helicopter before Jones existed
and that's person hanging from the
helicopter would travel on the power
line inspecting you know I'm gonna need
to do that so in some sense the promise
of yeah this is a massively dangerous
thing I hope those people were paid a
lot and that you no longer need to do
that so in that sense drones are here
you can do things with them the question
is is the sky full of drones clearly not
we can look outside and you don't walk
out and see drones up there the way you
see cars down the street so there's more
work to be done as angle have said you
know there's issues of reliability and
safety and someone that still need to be
solved to really scale up great test a
tail off the project wing what happened
so project wing was started by with your
help and and with Sergey and Astros help
the vision was to build vehicles that
could deliver anything to anybody
anywhere anytime and I think that's
still a great vision yeah and you did
this amazing thing in Australia where
you actually able to fly a package to a
farmer at one of the very first ones
ever and then we're down tell us about
it well so that that particular activity
was kind of fun in the sense that we
were doing prototype testing and both
involving real people and and the farmer
Neil I said you know what my dog is
super excited you think those are
something for the dog and so we kind of
like took our first order that day when
he one of the team members radioed and
said let's deliver a dog bones and we
happen to have them so that was just
kind of fun what we saw is that people
certainly in Australia but around the
world we're really ready for this that a
lot of the things that we thought might
be said in a negative way about it
generally weren't said and I think it's
a question of just maturing the
technology you know figuring out a lot
of the issues with reliability scaling
it up that it's going to be very
compelling and do you think these things
to be safe in the future are we there
for from the sky and kill people no I do
think it's safe it can be safe we see it
with airplanes airplanes are incredibly
safe so I think we we just need the
technology certain redundancy to make
this happen
TenPoint airspace management i mean if i
have if i look at the number of MSI
packages I get every day it's about
three and all my neighbours are three so
gonna be what in my neighborhood maybe
thirty thousand packages if they got all
they deliver by air how do we manage the
airspace
yeah this is a good question I'm not
sure if it is soft there are ideas
around that each drone when it takes off
reserves a certain space that it needs
for the next little while this would be
a distributed system so every tron
reserved space when it when it's needed
this may distribute it is never as good
as centralized system so I think we will
see if which which method will win so we
come here together because we are
building this joint cannot agree it's
the world's first educational program on
on flying cars and hopefully in a good
Udacity fashion we will teach more
students this technologies in all
university in the world combined let's
find out but I want to ask both of you a
bit about what you're actually teaching
and what the interesting problems are
for students mm-hmm mr. Winnick so for
me the flying car is you know a great
aspirational goal we've got a long way
to go
the real the content that I want
students to get from this is addressing
the challenges of making these vehicle
smarter so one of the dirty little
secrets of any unmanned system or that's
on the air on the ground is this whole
labor human labor required to operate
that unmanned system these vehicles are
fundamentally really dumb all they do is
get from point A to point B they can't
react to the unexpected in the ways that
people can they can't adjust what
they're doing that kind of intelligence
that kind of reasoning that kind of
autonomy is core to what we're trying to
teach for enabling flying cars great so
what I'm really excited about in this
nano degree is that we've really teach
the fundamentals on how the physics of
these vehicles were post fixed-wing and
multi rotor but then take it all the way
to a real implementation either in a
high-fidelity simulator or on the real
drone itself and I think both skills
really are needed to bring the field
forward
in the future
the the fact that these are flying
vehicles really forces you to deal with
the physics even something as simple as
how do you represent the attitude of the
vehicle is very different and much more
complicated to three dimensions
introduced into and that's core to what
we're doing it's fantastic so what who
should who should sign up for the
minitor v everybody well so you because
of the physics you're gonna have to have
a basic competence in math and you're
gonna have to basic competence in
programming and probabilities
probability yeah the uncertainty
real-world is key so you many you worked
in industry in particular at Google X
and hired people what's your general
assessment is this like air Astro people
don't talk to go bitte scientists today
or is there people in the in the middle
well that's a that's that is probably
the common case which is that air Astro
engineers and computer scientists have a
very different view of things computer
scientists are used to the idea of rapid
iteration and trying things until they
break and then fix it when things break
in midair bad things tend to happen in
arrastra engineers are very aware of
that and they're very responsible about
dealing with the failures what we're
thinking is a convergence of those two
as aero-astro engineering becomes more
receptive to the idea iteration and also
computation is core to everything that
we do now and computer scientists are
becoming frankly more responsible and
not deploying things that are just not
ready and we see that at every level we
see computer scientists and error
engineers at it right so residential
universities like MIT taking classes
together we see graduate students you
know becoming very similar and it's no
longer the case that you had to hire a
control engineer to prototype the system
and then a computer scientist implement
the reliable thing one person now has
enough skills to do what both of those
and I hope that this problem would
actually contribute to this I would love
for that to be case the massively
growing industry I think via in the
field of flight in general drones or
flying cars a bit of misnomer I think we
see the same activity and promise that I
would see in South Devon cars maybe five
six years ago when only Google and if
you smell other teams have worked on it
and now South Africa has to be
the biggest topic on the planet and I
could imagine that the flying car or the
flying drone could actually disrupt the
surviving car and the reason why I
believe this is because the air is much
more important the ground so I actually
do believe that safety in the air we
higher than safety on the ground because
as fewer things to hit as long as you
don't fall from the sky and fall subject
to gravity we should be able to be safer
than in the world that's my objective
for for this feat at all
it's pretty clear that the
transportation industry as a whole is
going to look very different thirty
years from now and you know I agree that
flying cars are gonna disrupt
Transportation on the ground it won't
eliminate it but it will make it look
very different yeah I'm not sure that
I'm ready or will ever be ready for my
sofa to be delivered by a drone maybe
but if a blimp maybe by a blimp but
there's gonna be a role for all these
different technologies and they're gonna
be complementary and that's what they
look like leaves that you could disrupt
Freight with flying vehicles mm-hmm if
you look at the math because the amount
of energy if they don't go fast the more
energy depends for lift is very small
compared to drag are you are you arguing
for all the ground transport going away
so I think these disruptions are it's
very hard to predict but they're very
nonlinear like if you look at a picture
of New York City from 1900 you see lots
of forces in an occasional car mm-hm you
go forward fast for about 30 years and
the city is full of cars and the
occasional horse and I don't think if
you had asked people in 1900 and looked
at the concept is this thing gonna take
of all the forces I think every person
was in absent in a way mm-hmm right and
it took 30 years in the modern age it
not was faster maybe takes 20 years I
could imagine I mean if I look at my
current traffic situation if I had a
same way to go from a home to my work in
five minutes to the era I would just
prefer this every single day over my
30-minute commute on the volunteer Shore
but we just in the same way you could
have said well our car is gonna disrupt
all of trains cars disrupted trains for
sure but they didn't eliminate them and
so I think they'll be like a mix of
these different technologies so I want
to feel a bit more into the issue of
safe
and and the reason is we are marrying
machine learning where we can typically
know what the outcome is was something
that if the outcome is wrong might fall
in our head or invoice might have a
person fall from the sky and you you're
an expert and you're super excited about
this tell us about this right yeah I'm
super excited to use machine learning to
enhance the capabilities of flying
vehicles and standard control systems
and we have found ways either by having
us the correct software architecture or
good underlying statistical machine
learning techniques to still guarantee
safety so we could allow flying vehicle
to adapt to a passenger's weight or
preferences vial guaranteeing that it's
stay safe in the air and then how does
this affect the machine learning I mean
if you look at machine learning today
there's all these wandering a deep
learning and it can detect cancer or
replace lawyers but there's no clear
rules like what safety means in those
fields so guaranteeing safety may may
mean guaranteeing stability and what the
resulting machine learning algorithms
may be more careful and learn slower but
adapt in a way that guarantees that I
always can come to us back to a safe
condition if something if I yeah
something goes wrong so one of the
things that I myself worry about is how
are we going to get to these models of
reliability we take conventional
engineering which generally means you
have a very clear mathematical model of
how the thing's supposed to work and you
can understand it self-driving cars
largely are just verified on the basis
of them lots and lots of millions and
millions of miles of testing those
things are not the same you have any
sense of how this is gonna boil out you
mean in terms of how we can guarantee
safe yeah are we gonna have like clear
models that describe how the thing's
supposed to work that we can we can
formally verify or inspect versus just
yeah it worked a million times it's
probably gonna work the million one time
yeah so how I view it as that we have
not a model but a set of models so that
could approximate all
different payloads that are flying car
needs to carry and then as we go in the
air we have a controller that guarantees
safety for all those possible models and
then as we gather more data we get more
information about the specific situation
that we have right now and so in Kitty
Hawk where you must be faced with the
same problems how are you planning to
verify or otherwise test or certificate
your systems we're working right now
with authorities on certification and
certification in the airspace industry
is a five to ten year effort where you
really have to characterize individual
components and make the case that if the
vehicle is users intended that the
probability of failure catastrophic
failure is is low but aids us is that
electric motors fail much less frequent
than regular combustion motors I think
if you think of a regular Cessna plane
or image jet there's an entire chemical
in the plane on board that transforms
like liquid fuel and - and the first
electric the only moving part is
actually a propeller and everything is
stationary so it makes it a little bit
easier however they also test a lot we
test a lot we test every day many many
flights every day and the business in my
experience there's the the things that
break a system are often unexpected they
often the confluence of two or three
different weaknesses and by testing it
regularly we get more more confidence we
can fly people but so it is still part
of a bigger system - so I don't know if
you're thinking about how the complexity
of the national airspace is going to
make it very hard to actually collect
all the data that we need for the kind
of testing you're talking about it
how are we going to do this yeah so one
approach I think is hierarchy so that
the lower level controller even if it
may be a learning controller adapts in a
certain way guarantees certain
performance limits to the higher level
airspace management system for example
but it's critical to test that as well
going back to Kittyhawk when do I get my
flying car we can take it with this
afternoo and we hope to go into
production
next year okay we are still in debugging
mode we will obviously multiple vehicle
only one with the public so far but the
nice thing about this is I can teach you
to fly in about two minutes okay as easy
to fly as a drone so I want to change
topic a little bit about prom doors
students or prospective students here
know that they listen to the professor's
and one of you Aftab you I'm like tell
us why my student should be so excited
about this I think flying will be a big
topic it is already a really big topic I
mean we see drones being applied to
mining construction insurance industries
and for me flying cars just another
aerial type of vehicle so but the
students learn will really apply to a
large range of different industries and
I think yeah aerial vehicles should be
considered by any industry and as a
possible to make their I don't know
operations my fix you see the really hot
knob coming topic right Nick well the
specific the feather thing that I think
is exciting specifically about the
Udacity offering is we're working really
really hard to make it as real as
possible if you have your own drone then
as you develop the projects through the
semester you can take that code test it
in simulation and assuming everything
works you could run it on your own drone
at home the first project should be
something that you can because what we
call it the backyard flyer because you
should be able to go under your backyard
and have the thing you did flying around
and even if you don't have your own
drone the hope is that we'll be able to
give you an opportunity to test it
remotely on a piece of hardware so like
you know if that connection to the
hardware is coridan I think this
offering and you know we're trying to
make that is at you know to the extent
that we can a unique experience yeah so
what type projects will people in the
students engage in mm-hmm so one project
via currently building is enabling
students to take the data from GPS and
IMU and
fuse it together to understand where the
vehicle is in the space and how it is
oriented and so that's a core algorithm
that we need for the vehicles to
understand where they are in the
environment and then we take this
information and the students will build
a controller from scratch that keeps the
vehicle in the air and then you have
multirotors and fixed wings right right
tell me about that so we start with
multirotors because that is something
first
that's a bit easier to understand in
terms of the physics and then the
students may have multirotors at home
that they can play this and better
understand their physics and program
them and later in the second term we
talk about fixed-wing because many
flying car concepts include fixed-wing
dynamics or so what's the advantage of
fixed thing about everything
the advantage is efficiency yeah so you
the goal is to fly faster this less
energy multi rotor have the advantage of
vertical takeoff and landing which is
important if you wanna get off a
high-rise building and fly to the next
high-rise building mm-hmm and what
projects do you have in mind beyond the
initial line well so as I mentioned
earlier what I'm really excited about is
getting the students to engage with the
challenge of how to make the vehicle
smarter so the the second project is
path planning how can the vehicle
generate its own flight path through a
cluttered urban environment taking into
account the constraints of obstacles and
maybe other regulatory constraints and
and flying a safe reliable path but then
the issues of autonomy come up in the
second semester as well where we look at
issues of mission planning so there's a
lot more to a vehicle doing a task than
simply getting from point A to point B
as I said earlier it's gotta be able to
get off the ground it's gonna be able
pick a landing location it's gotta be
able to sequence if you deliver a drone
delivering your three Amazon packages
and three to me or whatever getting
between all those an efficient way and
then planning in the context of other
aircraft fleet management and and
you know traffic management you know the
algorithms for that so both of you teach
at world-class universities university
on tour MIT and I'm a recovering sniper
professor I guess tell us in which way
do you think is Udacity different from
those institutions yeah so we actually
have two graduate courses on unmanned
aerial vehicles the major difference is
I think the the practical aspect as a
professor we don't have the resources to
build such a high high highly reliable
simulator and enable students to kind of
write almost ready code that they could
use in in a startup so if you if you if
you had a magic one would you then bring
the same practical aspects back to your
classroom in Toronto that's a good
question we do have projects there as
well practical projects I do think that
Udacity has really a role in preparing
students for the job and I think at the
university we want to build the kind of
basic knowledge that they can take and
then maybe take another Udacity course
and then go in a certain industry right
right so I view the Udacity I mean the
u.s. experiences is terrific and it had
preparing to teach this material has
definitely changed how I think about the
coursework that I prepare at MIT so
there's no question there's some ideas
and applying to bring back to MIT but
fundamentally I think they serve
different roles
whereas Udacity is communicating
specific skills to people in specific
ways I view myself more as a sort of
slightly touchy-feely but maybe more
organic producer of people who are going
to replace me eventually and that's just
a fundamentally different Enterprise
than what you'd add cities to turn to
accomplish great do you recommend yeah
MIT students will take a look at this
class sorry what was a question will you
recommend your MIT students to take a
look at oh yeah absolutely it's
especially for filling in specific
skills that you know so if a student for
whatever reason doesn't have the time or
can't fit into their schedule
some of the issues like planning or
estimation but just want to have the
experience of specifically implementing
it in an air vehicle context the Udacity
offering should exactly give them that
you know specific screams it's great I
mean I'm so delighted that we have such
amazing like thought leaders and
professors here involved as instructors
because I think it's a it's a fantastic
time where we can focus on job skills
and implementation skills but we also
get a good dose of vision of the field
and the theory behind it I think that's
our attempt here I think if you do a
good job I think students coming out
should not be lagging behind least in
the skill set of buildings flying
vehicles of what really good where that
students can do it top institutions like
Stanford MIT and University of Toronto
and I'm super super excited about doing
this because it like I say it does it's
a learning experience for me how to
bring this material together do it in
online fashion I think it's just you
know benefits all around I'm also really
impressed how you'd acid it builds
community between students but also
students professors companies it's it's
really building a community out around
self-flying Nicole disorganized as he
doesn't mean how disorganized is you
don't kidding I so whatever turbulence
we had early on I in firmly believe that
I know the weakest link in this process
so you know it's like watching them or
guessing they're broadcasting have you
ever like if you watch it jet come off
the deck of an aircraft carrier like
there's a certain amount of loss of
altitude initially but then like you
know you get lift and all as well so so
your current graduates but what type
jobs to your current graders take it to
go to industry my current graduates
basically all work on autonomous systems
flying or driving many move to the
Silicon Valley or work for startups in
the Toronto region they have a hard time
finding it all and I have no unemployed
credits
excellent well for me about half my
graduates have gone on to academic
positions so that's impressive I've been
very lucky to have some great people the
other half have not come to Silicon
Valley there's a lot of them have stayed
in the Boston area with one or two
exceptions but they largely have
startups and they've had no the biggest
problem they have is beating back the
hoards of people who are trying to poach
them away from from the startups so I
think that the work that we were doing
you know very fortunate is very
attractive employers right now yeah and
I think that the nanodegree even though
it's not as mighty as a PhD from Toronto
MIT and much more focus really to the
same effect as we seen in self-driving
cars where our students get hired long
before they even graduate from the under
view problem is kind of amazing and I'm
also impressed that sharp announcements
I see these days really include
explicitly hands-on skills robotics
skills and I think that's something that
you'd acity really provides yeah it
Kittyhawk I mean you must have the same
challenge in terms of finding Talent
hiring people what are you looking for
whether you have a really hard time
finding talent our main problem is that
the world of hardware and Aeronautics is
very separate from the world of machine
learning and software and and the the
style of development the speed of
development the ethics the the concern
of safety as you both mentioned is very
very different and then you get these
very crappy machine learning type people
that have built Google and then you get
this very careful Boeing and Airbus type
people who spent decades building maybe
a 777 and you bring him into one room
and it becomes a big fight and what I
love about bringing this together is I
think there's truth in both right I
don't know I mentioned before we can't
build a flying vehicle on an afternoon
the way we could maybe do a an iPhone
app but at the same time I don't wanna
wait 10 years until we've done the
industrial thing and part 5 me being
honest and do this to be the first my
car and let's see the possibilities here
and in this intersection we have a super
hard time hiring right now yeah that's
right if I can also ask what is your
biggest besides the the issues of hiring
and cultural difference what's the
biggest technical challenge you're faced
with right now
s'okay hog I think the there's do you
know not nothing unknown in the sense
that the flight dynamics are understood
and can be built the hardware is
understood and can be built the
software's understood and can be built
there's no magic that we have to pour I
would say the biggest challenge for us
right now
continious not to be more like AI and
airspace management and making the
systems robust using AI and and and
redundant and making them safe then
making the operations safe of modern use
at the same time and it becomes more
more of an intelligence issue of like
how to coordinate right if you look at
the way yes basically today with the FAA
if you fly in cement you get this huge
block of sky Alek ahead to your plane
for like 15 minutes or so and then
there's no other plane in this block
right but if you want every have say
10,000 drones in the sky at the same
time you can't do this you have to have
a space this small if something happens
like wind blows yours Vinci or what have
our you have a failure of a component
all of a sudden you've to reconfigure
everything and that's something we'll be
completely missing solutions to be one
of the things that I'm also really
interested in is you have a person in
the cabin and that person is gonna want
to know what's going on that interface
like it can't be you know a series of
switches and dials or probably can't
even be an app do you have a sense of
what that interactions gonna look like
maybe you're flying people regularly and
it's it's a lot of fun what we do right
now is we given people a really easy
interface to use we have a joystick they
go forward backward you can turn on the
spot and it can go up and down and if
you let your hands go then the Machine
just stays where it is which is no
aircraft in the world has that
capability today which means my
nine-year-old son can learn how to fly
in five minutes it's very cool and
that's the confluence of modern basic
cellphone type technology and sensing
and computing with this vertically
appealing idea of a multi order system
we show people basic things like how far
is your battery is the most important
life battery it's not good gravity will
actually get you but we don't quite know
yet how to coordinate the airspace right
so having many of these around and I
think that's an open issue where I mean
the FAA has very open invited
innovation and innovative people and as
we figure that out I think we're gonna
bid a massive industry in that space
that you students can be the first so
are you gonna hiring Udacity self-flying
our engineers of course evil absolutely
we have hired a lot of audacity students
before hear us leave them among our best
engineers and our best course makers and
I I see no exception here so I want to
ask you a final question okay
okay give us your best prediction I may
be starting with Nick what's the world
looked like in 50 years or now okay we
just stopped we know Miami's gonna be
totally underwater so fifty years from
now what's interesting on that question
is that nobody has really ever succeeded
at answering that question correctly
ever so I could say anything and we know
that's not gonna happen well I think a
couple of things we know are gonna be
true which is that you know
communication across the world is gonna
improve what I think is also gonna
happen is that people are going to have
devices whether their cars or drones or
or in their homes that make them much
more physically productive than they are
right now so we've had it so if you
think about how the world has evolved
over the last 150 years moving long
distances very hard
we got the railroad all of a sudden
people could travel long distances and
it opened up the West and Canada u.s.
and Australia and other countries and
then we got the ability to move things
you know to arbitrary locations through
the interstate highway infrastructure
and then I'll and all of a sudden we got
just-in-time manufacturing also I forgot
communication along distances through
the Telegraph and all of a sudden people
could live anywhere and talk to each
other in the telephone and now we can
move enormous amounts of information
around the globe through the internet
and and that kind of infrastructure and
and I think the next big thing is like
action a distance you know physical
devices that are smart enough to carry
out the intent of what people want but
far removed from the
and although that doesn't sound like
that justifying card vision fits in
there it's the flying car is gonna
benefit from that kind of intelligence
and we're gonna the world is gonna be
full of devices that do things for us
and interact with the environment in in
remarkable ways it was a great answer
yeah 50 years from now I really think
that we will have more physical
interaction like tools that right now we
have computing that makes our lives much
easier but we don't have the physical
interaction yet and I think that that
will come like like automated systems
that actually really work in the
physical world and not only in
industrial plants but in our homes and
in terms of the transportation I really
see no reason why transportation should
not become much much more autonomous for
people and for goods their trains cars
flying cars I think all of that could be
made autonomous and this way
transportation of real physical things
becomes much easier so I wanna I want to
invite you for the year 2000 67 to come
over here to mock view and then even
watch this tape together and spending as
Kitty Hawk aircraft to come pick us up
no I gotta be million well it's fun to
make this wonderful under discussion
happening and I'm so excited that both
of you are such great instructors in our
nanami program and for you watching if
you are intercessors becoming a student
enroll or apply and I guess I see you in
