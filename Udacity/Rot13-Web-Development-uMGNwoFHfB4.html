do is make a webpage with a form on it
that lets you rot dirt see rot13 some
text first I'll explain what rot13 is
okay so rot13 is a simple cipher to run
a simple encryption algorithm on some
text and so it looks something like this
okay if I were to check this string
hello and apply rot13 to it it would
look like this
you are yyb and what I've done is I've
incremented every letter by 13 so H
becomes you
it becomes our L becomes why L becomes y
and o becomes B so if I had an alphabet
like so if I were to convert each letter
I increment them by 13 so a moves 13
spaces and becomes n or H moves 13
spaces and becomes U and Z wraps around
moving 13 spaces and becomes M so if you
were to apply a Caesar cipher to itself
you get the ax string you originally
typed in so it's not the fanciest cipher
in the world but we're not trying to
test your cryptography skills there's a
another class for that I'm just trying
to test your web handling skills let me
show you what this should look like when
it's all working okay so here's the app
running on on my app spot account at
slash unit two slash rot13 if I type
some text in this in this field and
click submit it rear Enders this form
with my text in the text box and if I
were to hit submit again it converts it
back to hello okay this is what I'd like
you to build a couple things to notice
one is that a preserved case so the
capital H became a capital u in the
lower case ello became the lowercase R
YY and B I'd also like you to preserve
punctuation so I have expanded my text
here to have an exclamation mark and a
question mark and when I rot13 this it
preserves the exclamation mark and the
question mark and everything else
becomes rot13 and you know it's working
because when you run it again you get
the original text I'd also like you to
preserve whitespace okay I've added some
white space and another exclamation mark
and everything worked and here is one
thing to look out for remember you might
need to escape some HTML now this box
here this box of the text is using an
element we haven't talked about it's
called a text area and it's another form
element for entering large pieces of
text if I were to include this in my
text field and not escape it properly we
could have problems but as you can see I
have escaped my less dense and greater
than properly so everything works and I
can go back to text area and all as well
now this is running online so you can
verify what my expectations are by
playing her out with Maya with my own
version at this URL you can also if you
want and view the source of this page to
see the HTML I was using to you know
draw the bigger box and that sort of
thing it's it's fine if you want to use
that what I want you to do is implement
the backend part and once you have it
working I'd like you to enter the full
URL where it's running here now when we
grade this it's a little challenging so
you know obviously we're not gonna be
able to grade how it looks we're gonna
have an automated script that submits
some data and looks at the response make
sure you follow the notes below to have
the correct input name so when I submit
directly to your form I can see the I
can I can find my text in the result
okay good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
