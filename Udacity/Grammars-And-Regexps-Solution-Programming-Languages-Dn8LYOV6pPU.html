tricky quiz so don't feel bad if you had
a little trouble with it we want this P+
non-terminal to correspond to one or
more peas no matter which branch you
take here you're definitely getting at
least one p but we need you to have the
chance to get more so this option p plus
goes to pee that corresponds to picking
just one p plus goes to pee followed by
p plus this recursive rewrite rule gives
you the possibility to have as many as
you want possibly even infinite we've
seen that before with expression goes to
expression plus expression over here
this I ? is supposed to relate to I
option one possibility is that you don't
want to write an eye at all but another
possibility is that you do so here this
? means have either one or zero this is
the rule for having one this is the rule
for having zero and some strings in this
language are ppi ppi that sort of thing
and in fact if you have a bit of a
musical theater bent you can imagine
context-free grammars singing across two
regular expressions the classic line
from Annie Get Your Gun anything you can
do I can do better I can do anything
better than you to which classically the
opponent replies can you bake a pie no
neither can i but in fact any regular
expression relating to pie or something
similar as we've seen above can be
handled both by a regular expression
protagonist and our grammar protagonist
just a fun little interlude</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
