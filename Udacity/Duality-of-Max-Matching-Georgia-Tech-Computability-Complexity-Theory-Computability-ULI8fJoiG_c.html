times where there's one quantity that
we're trying to maximize and we have
another quantity that serves as an upper
bound for it
that we're trying to minimize and
luckily the two meet at some point that
is optimal for both we've just seen this
with our primal and dual linear programs
but we saw it earlier in the semester as
well with our max-flow min-cut problem
and also with our max matching and
bipartite graphs and our min vertex
cover in bipartite graphs it's natural
to ask are all these phenomenon related
well yes they are and probably the
easiest way to see that is to realize
that all of these can be characterized
as linear programs and their duals let's
take a look at duality in the context of
maximum matching in bipartite graphs
first we'll let the variable X IJ
indicate whether the edge
RJ should be included in the matching as
a linear program
the problem becomes to maximize the
number of matched edges subject to the
constraints that no vertex in R can be
matched more than once and no vertex and
L can be matched more than once and of
course we can't have negatively matched
edges to build the dual program we'll
let Y I and YJ be the variables
corresponding to these constraints and
we'll want to minimize their sum because
the coefficients on the constraints here
are all one for the constraints observe
that the coefficients in the objective
function are 1 and that any X IJ appears
once in the equation for their I and
once in the equation for J hence why I
plus YJ is at least one and of course
why I and YJ can't be negative the
interpretation here is straight forward
vertex I is in the cover if and only if
Y I is 1 and similarly vertex J is in
the cover if and only if YJ is 1 every
edge must have at least one vertex in
the cover and we're trying to minimize
the size of the cover so we've just seen
how maximum bipartite
can be expressed as a linear program and
it's dual also turned out to have a
natural interpretation as a vertex cover
problem this is really neat
every decision problem in P can be
converted into a linear program
ultimately just because linear
programming is p-complete
but not every conversion will result in
variables and a dual program that have
such intuitive interpretations when this
happens it often gives a way to gain
deeper insight into the problem and its
structure as you might have guessed this
happens also for the max-flow min-cut
problem and looks for that next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
