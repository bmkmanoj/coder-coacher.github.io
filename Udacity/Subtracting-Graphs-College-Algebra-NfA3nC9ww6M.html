happening here to our two curves on this
coordinate plane to create this black
line over here what I've drawn right now
is a bunch of lines going from the
x-axis up to our curve or our line
rather f of X what happens graphically
and we want to add three the length of
each of these lines is that we're
shifting them up so that they start
instead at the line y equals three if we
connect these lines now we end up with a
curve that looks just like our black
line over there so this line is
identical to the reddish one just with
every single point translated up three
units this is exactly what we were
talking about with transformations in
the last lesson working with the same
two functions as the last quiz what if
we want to subtract one of these
functions from the other one of these
three graphs represents F minus G of X
and another one of them is G minus f of
X which one is which in this top row of
bubbles please select F minus G and in
the bottom row please pick which one is
G minus F I wanted to keep the functions
written here for you
I'd recommend thinking about this
graphically but if you need to work with
the equations of the functions and
combine them mathematically first before
you pick the graphs that's also totally
fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
