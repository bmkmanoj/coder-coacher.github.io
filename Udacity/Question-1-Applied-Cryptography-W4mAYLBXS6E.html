key distribution he thinks the sets a
and B should have primes less than p is
that true yeah so indifferent helming we
have the exponents and B that are picked
they don't have to be related to pee
other than if p is very small there's no
point picking really large values for
andy if p is really big it's silly to
pick small values of a so the exponents
are usually recommended be at least 256
bits and that's because there's an
attack where the work is related to the
square root of the size of the exponent
rather than to the actual exponent so if
you want 128 bits of security you need a
256-bit value you need to select a as a
random value up to 256 bits and that
means if p is too small well your
attacker will go after p instead of
focusing on the attack art on a but
there's no particular relationship
between the size of a and the size of p
he also has another question about
diffie-hellman he wonders why in
practice it's less accepted than RSA so
this is a good question and they're both
actually widely used in practice RSA is
is more widely used and more talked
about they do different things so it's
not a question of one being thought of
as being more secure than the other and
the security of both depends on quite
similar problems diffident depending on
the discrete log problem RSA depending
on factoring there's no reason to
believe one of those is easier or harder
than the other and the property that
difficult gives you is just this key
agreement property RSA can do more
things like digital signatures and
encrypting messages so that's a more
versatile cipher you can do more things
with RSA all you can do with
diffie-hellman is agree on a key but
there are ciphers built on top of the
same ideas as diffie-hellman that can
provide the same properties as RSA</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
