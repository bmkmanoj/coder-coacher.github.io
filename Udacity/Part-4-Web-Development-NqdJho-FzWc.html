about some syntax I've used in Python
well basically with these asterisks in
in in function definitions and and
function calls and so i'll just show you
some Python syntax that I've been using
that is pretty helpful so one of the
things we can do and when we have a
function definition I'll call this
function foo you know it can take a
variable number of arguments this is a
handy thing you can do in Python and the
way you do this is you say star and then
you give it a variable name generally
you say star a and this basically says
take all of the arguments passed into
this function all the unnamed arguments
will come back to name the argument to
the second and store them in at uppal
and we'll call it a so that means in
this function foo we have a variable a
and if I were to return a and call foo
it would look something like this so if
I called foo with no arguments it would
return just an empty tupple if I were to
call foo with the arguments 1 2 3 it
would return a tuple of 123 if I were to
change this to return a 0 and i would
call foo with 123 again it would just
return the number one and so this is a
handy way of making a function that can
take any number of arguments now I use
this in class in unit 3 when we were
pulling a link out of the database when
we're pulling a link out of that sequel
light database in the IDE what you get
when you pull something out of the
database is just a couple of all the
columns and I can pass that topple into
the link constructor to make a link
object and so that's what I was doing
there now something you've seen in my
code looks something like this I often
have a function i think in my code i
have something that's like this def
render oops Oh / in there and it may
take star a and star star KW it was two
stars
and sketch pad they edit all these
mistakes out so generally when you see
this this this kind of construct in
Python star a star star KW that means
they're writing a function that adds a
little bit behavior to another function
and so I have another function you know
I think it's like some sort of ginger
rendering thing oh I think I actually I
think what we see is template you know
we have we have a template name that's
probably not the argument of the
function and we may say like T dot T dot
render star a star star KW and basically
all this is doing sis is taking our
goods from this function the unnamed
arguments and the named arguments a
named argument be like you know x equals
1 versus an unnamed argument which would
just be one and I'm passing those
directly into another function and
probably what I did here in my render
function in my code is i modified this
KW argument i added some parameters to
it that sort of thing and so basically
now I have this function render which
does exactly what T that render does
except I've added more parameters to KW
now so there's two uses of stars and
star star one is in the function
definition which we've talked about
before and the others in the function
call if you if you have a tough ball or
in this or dictionary and you put them
in a function call with the star and the
star star KW it breaks those data
structures apart and passes them in as
parameters which is really handy so
they're kind of you know in a function
definition it's basically takes all the
parameters and puts them into a topple
and then a function call it takes a
tough ball and turns them into function
parameters and so I say hey anything in
Python you see it all the time generally
a kW are the variable names you would
use but you can use whatever you want
and you can use them in other contexts
like we did with the link database so I
hope that helps there's also I believe
links on the forum to Python function
calls I kind of explain the syntax for
you as well so there we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
