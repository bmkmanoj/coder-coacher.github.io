negative 1 to 1 if so you should be very
proud of yourself I know I am let's see
how we got that solution remember when
you're working with a compound
inequality that's written in this form
we can perform operations as long as we
do the same operation to all three
portions of the equation the first thing
I want to do is to get rid of this
fraction by multiplying through by the
least common denominator and the least
common denominator is 2 when I multiply
2 by negative 3 i get negative 6 when i
multiply 2 x 5x minus 1 over 2 i'm
simply left with 5x minus 1 and when i
multiply 2 times 2 i get for next I'm
going to add one to each part of the
equation so I can isolate the variable
in the middle when I do that negative 6
plus 1 is negative 5 and 4 plus 1 is
positive 5 now i can divide through by 5
negative 5 divided by 5 is negative 1
less than or equal to x less than or
equal to 5 over 5 is positive 1 let's
draw that on the number line this
portion of the inequality says that
negative 1 is less than or equal to X
which is the same as X is greater than
or equal to negative 1 so that means
we're going to be going in that
direction this portion of the equation
says X is less than or equal to positive
1 so we use a square bracket and the
answer is going here so we have the
interval from negative 1 to 1 using the
square brackets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
