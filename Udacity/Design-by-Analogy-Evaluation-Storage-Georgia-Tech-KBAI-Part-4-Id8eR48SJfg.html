role in the agility of loops in this
analogical reasoning process one can use
several different methods for doing
evaluation and your robot that can walk
on water for example we can do a
simulation or we can build a physical
prototype if the evaluation succeeds
then well and good we can encapsulate
the target problem in a solution as a
case and store it in case memory well if
the evolution fails we may need to
revisit transfer and see whether we want
to transfer some other knowledge or
revisit mapping and perhaps align things
differently or revisit retrieval and
perhaps try to retrieve a different
source case as an example supposing the
devaluation shows that the robot that we
designed for walking on water is a
little too heavy in that particular case
we may change the problem specification
and retrieve a different kind of
organism that perhaps this little
lighter let us suppose that we evaluate
the design of the robot that can walk on
water and find that the design is a
little too heavy in that case we can go
back to the transfer stage and see
whether we can transfer some of the
relationship that might make the robot a
little lighter or we can go back to the
mapping stage and see whether we can
align this source case and the target
problem slightly differently so that we
can transport a different relationship
or alternatively we can go back to the
retrieval stage and try to retrieve a
source case different kind of biological
organism altogether thus we see that the
process of analogical reasoning is not
linear at all instead it can have many
different kinds of iterations analogical
reasoning continues to be an important
topic in AI research and biologically
inspired design is becoming one we
provide several readings for both topics
