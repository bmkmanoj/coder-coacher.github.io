example from the last unit and we have
objects for representing menus as well
as for representing a dish so here's
some code we might use to define a dish
class we only have two methods we've
defined the knit method which takes name
price and description and assigns those
two attributes of the self object and we
define the store method which turns it
into this string and I've used the
string format method to do that formats
a really useful method provided by the
string built-in type of in Python we can
see it's a string method here's the
string and then we're using dot and
format as the attribute and we're
calling that method passing in these
values there are lots of things we can
do in this format string to get output
the way we want here the special syntax
with the squiggly braces allows us to
put values inside our string and in this
case we're putting the value of name
which is what was passed in as the name
parameter so it's going to print out the
name of the dish followed by the
description with parentheses around it
and now for the price we've got the
price as our value pessimist price and
that's a number we want that tip here
with two decimal points so it'll look
like this and that's what we get with
the point 2f we could of course have
written our own code to do all this if
we didn't know about format but formats
a really easy way to generate formatted
strings and there are lots and lots of
different things we can do with format
I'm not going to go into details here
I'm going to assume that you're all
enough of a Python nista at this point
to be able to figure it out yourself
from the Python documentation and from
examples and you'll find a link to that
