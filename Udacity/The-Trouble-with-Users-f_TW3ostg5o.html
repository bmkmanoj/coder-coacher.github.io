integration point between the
application and the user in particular
we allow for freeform text entry of the
location that means there are multiple
ways the user can get something wrong
the user can input text that doesn't
actually resolve to a location or the
user can input text that resolves to a
different location than they are
expecting we're going to look at
handling the first problem the user the
inputting text that doesn't resolve to a
location the second problem is a bit
trickier many users use zip codes to set
their location because we use that by
default in our application one of the
fascinating parts about the world's
postal system is the fact that postal
codes tend to be unique within each
country rather than truly unique as a
result sometimes upholster code and
which was intended for location in the
United States will return the
information for a location outside the
United States even if the postal code is
properly written in addition they're
often cities around the world that share
the same name unless the user types in
this entire name including state
province and country we may get this
wrong as well note that we currently
have a function that map's the location
so a determined user can find out where
their whether search is geo located</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
