at the HTTP request
I'll try it myself okay we have our form
I click Submit
and boom here we are this is actually
what we're looking at is the HTTP
request well look at the code in a sec
to remind ourselves how this happened
but you remember from our first lesson
when we talked about HTTP requests and
how they look well here's our request
line get and then our URL slash test
form and then Q equals the text we typed
in the in the field you can see a couple
more headers except and what what
languages we are expecting to receive
what character sets are okay you can see
the host header we're familiar with that
one you can see the referer header refer
headers interesting this refers to the
URL that sent that sent this request so
the URL of our form is localhost 8080
slash and the URL run right now is you
know slash test form but this header is
helpful for for telling the server where
the request came from you notice that
refer is misspelled here that's because
in the original HTTP spec the word refer
was spelled wrong it normally has to
ours but it's lived on for backwards
compatibility reasons for nearly 20
years now and this is actually
symptomatic of how a lot of things in an
HTTP or on the web are which is you know
somebody made a decision you know 20
years ago that still haunts us today and
it's not necessarily a bad thing it's
just a site effective of you know when
things grow organically over time
another header we've talked about our
user agent in this case I'm using I'm
using Chrome you can see that here and a
lot amidst a bunch of version
information on Mac OS X looking at our
code here's what we did we set the
content type to text plain if we hadn't
done that the the response we were
looking at in the HTML or in the browser
would have looked weird because the
browser would have assumed it was HTML
and a lot of that text wouldn't have
shown up so we set at the plain because
I knew what we were going to do then
instead of writing text or writing out
our Q parameter we actually wrote off
this request object itself which is the
Python object that represents the
quest but conveniently it prints out
very much like HTTP looks which is not
the coincidence so it's a handy little
tool though when you're when you're
writing web applications and debugging
you want to see you know where something
broke or you know what's going on you
can just print out the request and see
so let's let's replace these two lines
again back to the way they were and move
on to something else I'm just going to
comment these lines out however because
we're going to need them for later so
this is how our file was before let's
move on to a new section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
