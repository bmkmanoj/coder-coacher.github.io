may be using a little bit more closely
clearly Watson is doing a large number
of things it is trying to understand
natural language sentences this time to
regenerate some natural language
sentences it is making some decisions
I'll group all of these things broadly
under reasoning reasoning as a
fundamental process of knowledge-based
AI a second fundamental process of
knowledge-based AI is learning Watson
clearly is learning also it perhaps gets
the right answer to some questions and
stores that answer somewhere if we get a
wrong answer and then once it learns
about the right answer it stores the
right answer also somewhere learning to
is a fundamental process of
knowledge-based AI a third fundamental
process of knowledge-based AI is memory
if you're going to learn something that
knowledge that you're learning has to be
stored somewhere in memory if we can do
reason using knowledge then that
knowledge has to be accessed from
somewhere from memory so memory
processes will store what we learn as
well as provide access to knowledge that
we need for reasoning these three
fundamental processes of learning memory
and reasoning are intimately connected
we learn so that we can reason the
results of reasoning often result in
additional learning once we learn we can
store it in memory however we need
knowledge to learn the more we know the
more we can learn reasoning requires
knowledge that memory can provide access
to the results of reasoning can also go
into memory so here are three processes
that are close iterated a key aspect of
this course on knowledge-based AI is
that we will be talking about theories
of knowledge-based AI that unify
reasoning learning and memory instead of
discussing any one of the three
separately as sometimes happens and some
schools of AI rigged and retractable
unified accounts of these three
processes put together I'll call them
deliberation this deliberation process
is one part of the overall architecture
of a knowledge-based AI agent this
figure illustrates the over
architecture of an area agent here we
have input in the form of perceptions of
the world and output in the form of
actions of the world the agent may have
large number of processes that map this
perception to actions we are going to
focus right now and deliberation but the
agent architecture also includes
metacognition and reaction that we'll
discuss later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
