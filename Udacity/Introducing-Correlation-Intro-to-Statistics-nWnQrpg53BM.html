called correlation it's an important
statistical term and in the end of this
unit you'll be able to use it yourself
here's the fundamental problem sometimes
theater lines aren't very nicely like
these points over here other times two
variables seem to be utterly unrelated
correlation is a measure it lies between
minus one all the way to one that tells
us how well the data is described by a
line in both cases you can fit a line
but in one case it'll be a really good
description of the data whereas in the
others it won't so the correlation
coefficient often called R is one if the
data is perfectly aligned for the line
it's zero if there seems to be no
relation between the two different axes
and adhere and also can be minus one in
the case where the data in fact is still
perfectly aligned but there's a negative
relationship between one variable and
the other variable so let me see if you
got this here are three data sets in one
we have a strongly positive correlation
another it's about zero and then the
third one it'll be a negative
correlation which of these cases best
describe those conditions and use each
condition exactly once here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
