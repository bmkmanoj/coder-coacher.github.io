talking about earlier maybe it was you
maybe it was somebody else well that
manager is still handing out assignments
manually let's write the program that
will assign them automatically I've got
it started for you
I wrote a class simulation you don't
need to look at it too hard there's a
lot of stuff in here that you don't need
to know yet mostly what it's doing is
it's reading in a story the story is a
text file inside the directory with the
code it's called story txt the
simulation class reads these lines of
the story on a manager object let's look
again at this story first the manager
hires photographers there's a
photographer Danny then a photographer
Leslie each day there's a meeting where
the manager gives out assignments the
managers going to start with the first
photographer and give out the highest
priority assignment available first so
in this case that would be the parrot
assignment which has priority 5 in
between daily meetings the manager gets
assignments these assignments need to be
added to the to-do list since choosing a
priority is a complicated task I just
included the priorities for you the
priorities will be int and a higher
number means a higher priority
assignment so the assignment should be
done sooner when we come to the end of
the story we'll check the portfolio and
display all of the pictures your task
will be to complete the methods inside
the manager class using whatever other
classes you need to create so that when
you run the main method in the
simulation class it'll print out the
finished photos from left to right with
no space between them and the name of
the photographer under each picture so
when you run the main method of the
finished code you should see something
like this the first photo is of a parrot
and it was done by Danny the second one
is of a mountain done by Leslie and so
on make sure that the signature has its
top left corner right at the bottom left
corner of the photo now I've written one
other thing for you the photographer has
the complicated job of creating a photo
based on a description if this were real
life a person would be taking the photo
and loading it into the system but we
don't have time to wait for that so I've
included some photos and a method in the
photo
requests that gives the name of a file
with a photo when you give it a
description all of the descriptions in
the story so all of these ones already
have photos for them and the
photographer knows how to find those
photos aside from that you have free
reign you can add whatever classes you
need to make this work so to submit your
answer you'll need to find a way to use
the classes that are in the Udacity IDE
you can't make new files in the Udacity
IDE but if you use bluej you can create
whatever classes you want I'll give you
a little tour of how I designed my
solution at the end but there are a lot
of ways to do this and many of them are
good for different reasons one less
thing I understand that this is very
open-ended so if you'd like more
guidance
check out the hint links that will show
up here and if you can't make it work
it's not your fault and if you're
satisfied with your progress and what
you've learned from the question it's
okay to move on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
