which I mentioned earlier in today's
lesson let me give you two historical
quotes the give an idea of what
conceptual integrity is all about the
first is from the philosopher Descartes
he said of these thoughts one of the
very first that occurred to me was that
there is seldom so much perfection in
works composed of many separate parts
upon which different hands have been
employed as in those completed by a
single master more recently Fred Brooks
in the mythical man-month has said much
the same thing I will contend that
conceptual integrity is the most
important consideration in system design
it is better to have a system omit
certain anomalous features and
improvements but to reflect one set of
design ideas
than to have one that contains many
independent and uncoordinated ideas a
couple of related concepts are coupling
and cohesion these originally came out
of structured design but they also apply
to object-oriented design and other
design approaches assuming you've carved
your system into separate components
those components may be coupled to each
other
coupling is the extent to which two
components depend on each other for
successful execution if you think about
it for a minute
low coupling is good after you've
delivered your system and you have to
maintain it if you have a highly coupled
system and you change one module that
means that you're likely to have to
change other modules whereas if there's
low coupling that likelihood goes down a
related concept is cohesion with
cohesion we're talking about a single
module and cohesion is the extent to
which a module or component has a single
purpose or function high cohesion is
good for example highly cohesive modules
are much more easy to reuse they have a
single purpose you need to reuse them to
accomplish that purpose</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
