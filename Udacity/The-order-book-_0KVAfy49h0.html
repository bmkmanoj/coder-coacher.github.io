something called the order book each
exchange keeps an order book for every
stock that they buy or sell and here's
how it works let's suppose you've just
issued an order to buy a hundred shares
of IBM with a limit price of ninety nine
ninety five and let's suppose for the
moment that this arrives at the New York
Stock Exchange and so far today nobody's
put in any orders so your order is the
first one and they'll use it as the
basis to start building their order book
so yours is the first entry in the order
book and it simply shows somebody has
bid 99.95 for a hundred shares of stock
and this is public knowledge people can
view this and see ok there's interest in
buying shares of this stock now they
don't know who has made this bid the
exchange knows that it's you that's made
that bid but they see that there's
interest in a hundred shares now others
may send in orders like yours and this
number just keeps getting larger
depending on how many orders come in
when this is displayed publicly people
just see that ok there's interest maybe
from various people in a thousand shares
of IBM at ninety nine ninety five so far
nothing's been bought or sold yet though
because we don't have anybody willing to
sell well let's suppose a sell order
comes in sell IBM thousand shares limit
of hundred dollars well there's nobody
willing to buy a thousand shares at a
hundred dollars so the exchange again is
going to have to add this order to its
order book and this will be our first
ask we've got now our first ask as part
of our order book now let's say more and
more orders come in and it flushes out
our order book a bit here's our order
book as its fleshed out a bit as orders
have come in we've got a number of asks
which are requests to sell stocks and a
number of bids which are requests to buy
suppose now we get a market order to buy
a hundred shares of stock here's our new
order and here's what happens the
exchange looks at its order book and it
sees yes we have lots of shares for sale
here we have to give the client the
lowest price so we'll give that client a
hundred shares of these that are priced
at a hundred dollars so that means now
we've only got 900 left here we take
that hundred give that to the client to
put in the order and this is the state
now of our order book after that
