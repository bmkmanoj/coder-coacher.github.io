networking and how network operators
perform traffic engineering inside a
data center first of all what
characterizes a data center data center
network has three important
characteristics one is multi-tenancy
multi-tenancy allows a data center
provider to amortize the cost of shared
infrastructure but because there are
multiple independent users the
infrastructure must also provide some
level of security and resource isolation
data center network resources are also
elastic meaning that as demand for a
service fluctuates the operator can
expand and contract these resources it's
also can be paper use meaning that as
the need to use more resources arises or
disappears a service provider can adjust
how much resources are devoted to the
particular service running in the data
center another characteristic of data
center networking is flexible service
management or the ability to move work
or workloads to other locations inside
the data center for example as load
changes for a particular service an
operator may need to provision
additional virtual machines or servers
to handle the load for that service or
potentially move it to a completely
different set of servers inside the
infrastructure this workload movement
and virtual machine migration
essentially creates the need for traffic
engineering solutions inside a data
center a key enabling technology in data
center networking is the ability to
virtualize servers this makes it
possible to quickly provision move and
migrate servers and services in response
to fluctuations in workload but while
provisioning servers and moving them is
relatively easy we must also develop
traffic engineering solutions that allow
the network to reconfigure in response
to changing workloads and migrating
services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
