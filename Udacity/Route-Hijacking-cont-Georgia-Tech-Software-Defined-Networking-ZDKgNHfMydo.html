initial compromised rate or designing a
very fast spreading worm is to create a
hit list or a list of vulnerable hosts
ahead of time that current we just saw
shows that the time to infect the first
10,000 hosts dominates infection time so
if we start by performing stealthy scans
or some reconnaissance to construct a
list of vulnerable hosts before we start
spreading then we can get rid of that
initial flat part of the curve where the
worm is effectively dormant the second
approach is to use something called
permutation scanning where every
compromised host has a shared
permutation of an IP address list to
scan for vulnerabilities now if this
list is randomly permute 'add and a
particular host starts scanning from its
own IP address in the list and works
down then different infected hosts will
start scanning from different parts of
this list ensuring that compromised
hosts don't duplicate each other's work
one worm that exploited these techniques
to spread particularly quickly was the
slammer worm which spread in January of
2003 exploiting a buffer overflow in
Microsoft's SQL Server in addition to
using fast scanning techniques the
entire slammer code fit in a single
small UDP packet the UDP packet
contained the worm binary followed by an
overflow pointer back to itself it was a
classic buffer overflow combined with
random scanning once the control was
passed to the worm code it randomly
generated IP addresses and attempted to
send a copy of itself to port 1434 on
other hosts one brilliant aspect of the
slammer worm is that because it was
spread via a single UDP packet it was
connectionless meaning that it could
spread and was no longer limited by the
latency of network round-trip time but
only by the bandwidth of the network the
worm caused 1.2 billion dollars in
damage and temporarily knocked out
any elements of critical infrastructure
including Bank of America's ATM network
an entire cell phone network in South
Korea and five route DNS servers as well
as continental airlines is ticket
processing software the worm actually
did not have a malicious payload but the
bandwidth exhaustion on the network
caused resource exhaustion on the
infected machines here is a picture of
the hosts around the world that slammer
infected this damage was inflicted in
just 30 minutes due to the very
lightweight nature in which slammer
spread</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
