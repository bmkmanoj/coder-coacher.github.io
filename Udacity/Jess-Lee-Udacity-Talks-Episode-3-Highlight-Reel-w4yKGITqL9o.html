the third time we have a super exciting
guess with us justly quite an amazing
company that recently sold yahoo is the
CEO of the company called poly war and
she's one of these really unbelievable
great leaders in Silicon Valley that we
came out of a relatively normal
education and became on the top minds
and brains in Silicon Valley welcome
thank you thanks for having me it's
great having new year as you always do
in these talks I have a few questions
prepared and then with our students
speak or students submitted literally
hundreds of questions for you what did
you learn at Google I learned a lot at
Google I think it was my first job and
what Google taught me was you just take
really smart people and you define a set
of problems and you throw them at the
problem and you really empower them
amazing things can happen so I learned
that from google the importance of like
creating great culture that empowers
people the importance of hiring really
smart people I think I also learned some
anti-patterns though which is funny that
don't work as well at startups the great
thing about Google and one reason is
able to be this engineering playground
is it discovered early on search and how
to monetize search so it has this money
printing machine in the form of search
ads Adwords and that funds everything
else wouldn't you want the same as a
start-up oh yeah except you don't you
don't have that you have you know a
runway from your venture capitalists or
the revenue that you generate and for us
at polyvore you know that was something
I always thought about and I really
wanted to build a sustainable company
that was a real business so I was you
know we actually got to profitability it
was really proud about it became
possible how did you actually determine
if your idea of the ideas was really in
demand prior to committing to it yeah so
chicken egg question of any startup yeah
it is so important to show things to
real users and there are lots of
different tips and tricks for how to do
that you can use user research and even
if you don't have like a user researcher
in house you can go to Starbucks and put
up a little sign don't tell starbucks
you're doing this though or any coffee
shop and then like bring users by show
them you know it is something that
you're working on another type of
sing that that we do at polyvore is
called fake door testing I have a much
longer talk about it but it's
essentially you don't know if a
particular feature will work or not and
you don't want to invest the time to
build it so you faked this that the
feature is there put a button there that
has whatever it is that you were going
to build and CM people click on it if it
doesn't work you know maybe says sorry
coming soon but at least you'll know how
many people would have wanted to use it
and that can give you a signal as to
whether you should build it or not every
success fentiman your claims to have a
law or method success for stopping it
yeah like some secret instead of
ingredients where it is do you have one
yeah you know I was thinking about that
and I would say that they're the the
core values that I believe in are now
actually polyvore core values they
define our culture but there's three
things the first is um delight the user
you have to build something that really
delights them that they love they want
to tell their friends about and no
matter how good you how much money you
raise how good your marketing is or your
PR like if you don't have that like you
can't win so that's the number one most
important thing the second core value is
do a few things well I really believe in
focus and the third is make an impact
which is really what it means is higher
amazing smart people and empower them I
took us eight years from the very
beginning of polyvore to you know a
successful outcome and and being
acquired by yahoo and i think people
don't realize that the average time from
start to exit for a start-up is actually
nine years so yes you have to do
something that you really love and you
have to do it with people that you love
being around because it takes so much
energy and there's so many things that
can go wrong I mean everything goes
wrong along the way and the odds are
just totally against you you know most
startups don't just fail right so you
just you just remember that the journey
is supposed to be long it's supposed to
be hard but enjoy it right how do you
balance in a company like 40 more the
social goods with the money mayhem we
have what i like to call a resident
business model where the user is happy
because they found a product they want
to buy and they discovered all this
great stuff from you know real people
have told them like this is what you
know check out this this logo this
outside that they've
someone else is created and then they
buy something you know then our
advertisers make money so what makes a
user happy finding a product they like
it's also what makes our advertiser
happy so that's the resonant business
model versus like a dissonant one so it
kind of just goes hand in hand because
all the shopping and the content is
driven by the the community of people
who are trying to democratize style I
think the Internet has a way of
democratizing everything that it touches
so I mean that's happening the fashion
industry to and what polyvore does is
that empowers women and girls all over
the world to say no no this is what we
think is cool this is what we think is
beautiful pretty good mask Avengers yeah
yeah and as you know a young girl
growing up you I I certainly felt this
way like oh I supposed to look like this
and I don't know I don't there's no
reason to feel bad about its style
should be about expressing who you
really are and being authentically
yourself you said at some point that
your mom had a big impact on you yeah so
when I was growing up in Hong Kong my
mom she ran her own company and so
growing up I watched her be both I guess
the CEO of her own company and a mom and
you know she bounced both and I never it
never occurred to me that it might be
unusual for a woman to be running her
own company and I think I always had
that impression so you might look around
and not see as many women just don't be
discouraged by that like still just
focus on doing really really amazing
work and connect with other women who
are maybe in the same space or who've
come before you and try to learn from
them but learn from from both men and
women I've had a lot of female and male
mentors and it's it's been amazing just
surround yourself with the best people I
think that's great advice for any wise
advice totally yeah is any specific
things that you encounter with salem you
have to be more tenacious or you have to
be more aggressive sometimes well
actually I feel like you have to find
your own style you have to lean into
whatever your strengths are I've had a
couple of different really amazing role
models who taught me it was okay to sort
of let my personality out or not fit
that classic alpha male mold and so I
would say think about that look around
for that and you know find the style
that's right for you just it's been an
unbelievable pleasure having here for
you Darcy talks it's so fascinating to
here you'll explain what you've done and
I really admire your work and thank you
so much chesser computer thanks for
having me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
