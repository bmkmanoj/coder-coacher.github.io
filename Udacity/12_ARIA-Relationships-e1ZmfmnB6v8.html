refer to as a relationship attribute a
relationship attribute creates some kind
of semantic relationship between
elements on the page in the case of our
a label by that relationship is this
element is labeled by that element or as
the case may be this element is labeled
by those elements the aria 1.0 spec
lists several relationship attributes
with a few more coming in aria 1.1 most
Aria relationship attributes take a
reference to one or more elements to
create a new link between elements on
the page what differs in each case is
what that link means and how it is
presented two uses one of the most
widely used Aria relationships is
barrier owns this allows us to tell
assistive technology that an element
which is separate in the Dom should be
treated as a child of the current
element or to rearrange existing child
elements into a different order for
example if a pop-up submenu is visually
positioned near its parent menu but
cannot be a dumb part of it because that
would affect the visual presentation or
because the element is used in several
different contexts we can use Aria owns
to present the submenu as a child of the
parent menu in terms of the
accessibility tree we start off with two
menus which aren't semantically linked
in any way if the sub menu is showing an
assistive technology user would not be
able to explore into it in the context
of the other menu it would appear after
the end of it by setting Aria owns on a
placeholder in the top level menu we can
express the submenu relationship without
affecting the appearance of the sub menu
re owns can take a list of ID references
so can also be used to explicitly
specify the order of children for
example to rearrange children or
interleave native and non-native
children by default Aria owns children
will come after natively owned children
aria-activedescendant plays a related
role just as the active element of a
page is the one which has focused sit in
the active descendant of an element
allows us to tell assistive technology
that when its parent has page focus
it should be presented to the user as
the actual focused element for example
if we have a list box widget we may wish
to keep focus on the list box container
so that it can receive keyboard events
and keep its aria-activedescendant
attribute updated to the currently
selected list item this makes the
currently selected item appear to
assistive technology as if it is the
focused item Aria described by allows
you to provide an accessible description
in the exact same way that are a labeled
by allows you to provide a label this is
a useful technique whenever there is
some extra explanatory text that a user
might need whether that applies to only
users of assistive technology or all
uses one common example is a password
input field which is accompanied by some
descriptive text explaining their
requirements for a valid password unlike
a label the description may or may not
ever be presented to the user they may
have a choice of whether to access it or
it may come after all the other
information and be preempted by
something else for example if they start
entering information the input will be
echoed back and Inter after the
description of the element so
description is a great way to
communicate information which is
supplementary but not essential it won't
get in the way of other more essential
information like the role of the element
like Aria labeled by RA described by may
reference elements which are otherwise
not visible whether hidden from the dumb
or hidden from assistive technology uses
the remaining two relationship
attributes are a little different and
work together re opposing set short for
position in set and aria set size are
about defining a relationship between
sibling elements in a set such as a list
in the case where the size of the full
set cannot be determined by the elements
present in the Dom such as when lazy
rendering is used to avoid having all of
a large list in the Dom at any given
time aria set size can be used to
specify the actual size of the set an
aria pausing set can be used to specify
the position of the element in the set
for example in a set which might
potentially contain 1,000 elements I can
see that a particular element has an
area positon set of 857 even though it
appears first in the Dom and then use
dynamic HTML techny
to ensure these they can explore the
full list on demand note that aria set
size is set on the items in the set and
not on the set container</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
