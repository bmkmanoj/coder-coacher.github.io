to use to kind of introduce the term of
alpha blending let's see what that means
so by doing a multiplication that I have
done here with 0.33 4 before each and
every image what I've done is basically
added kind of AB laut and do a mixing of
different types of things basically what
I've done is I've made the original
image compared to the next one
transparent by 34%
so in essence transparency is what an
alpha is referred to as so in essence
what actually that means is I've
actually converted and given each one of
them and made each one of them
transparent about 34% from the original
image this is referred to as an alpha
and usually varies from zero to one
where zero is completely invisible
remember if I'd x zero here you would
not have seen Leonardo DaVinci at all if
I'd x one you would have seen him
completely visible of course would have
had changes to your dynamic range of the
pixel values here but this guy to
DaVinci would have been perfectly
visible and similarly could play around
with these numbers for all of them so
alpha varies from one zero to one where
zero is invisible and one is fully
visible so in essence one of the ways we
could do this is now basically add
another layer so RGB are the three
layers of the image or three channels an
alpha could be another channel which
would have values from 0 to 1 and RGB
would have of course the intensity
values from 0 to 255 this additional
number alpha value could be also be
computed and put inside those channels
or kept separately and actually dealt
with as a different mask and this is an
interesting way of being able to now
create a separate mask which we would
then be able to play around with for
different applications again something
we will come back to as we look at many
examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
