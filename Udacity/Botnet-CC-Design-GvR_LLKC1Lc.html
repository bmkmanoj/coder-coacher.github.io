question to consider in terms of barnett
cnc design is how can the bots contact
their masters safely in other words in a
stealthy and robust way and as we have
just discussed a naive approach is not
adequate for example if we have
hard-coded malware to include a single
IP address of our command control server
then when this IP address has been
identified by security
Emmons the network admins such as
immense in the ISP can block all traffic
to this server therefore no command
control traffic from the bots can be
reached to the master server and as a
result the whole Barnett's is disrupted
for example if all about counted a
single IP address there's hard-coded in
a bot malware then when this IP address
is identified by secured Emmons the
never Emmons for example those at is
p-chem park or traffic to this IP
therefore blocking all command control
traffic and disrupting the operations of
the botnet and because such naive
approach is not stealthy nor robust it
is only used by script cádiz and
first-time malware authors in addition
to safety utility is also very important
to the part master in other words a bar
master wants efficient and reliable
communications so that he can reach and
coordinate enough parts to perform a
specific task
so to summarize the design
considerations of balanced CNC the by
master will want efficient and reliable
communication that is the ability to
reach a sizeable set of paths within
certain time limit stealthy
communication so that it is hard to
detect CNC traffic resilient or robust
communication so that it is very hard to
disable a block CNC traffic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
