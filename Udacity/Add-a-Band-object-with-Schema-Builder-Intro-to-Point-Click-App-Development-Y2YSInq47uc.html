of a festival up yes and so far we're
keeping track of the festivals mm-hmm
the attendees and the stages yeah so
this is good
yeah so let's add some complexity into
the app by going into Salesforce but I
mean as we're adding in more objects and
relationships that might become a little
bit hazy as to how they're actually
related and so let's use this new tool
called schema builder which is an easy
way for you to not only build your data
model but also visually see it and how
everything's related together kind of
similar to what we saw earlier on the
tablet sounds good
just click on the setup link and then go
on the left-hand side down the setup
tree to find schema builder okay well
there's a lot going on what are these
like content activity what are all these
other objects all of these are all of
the objects that you have within your
schema and so these are the standard
objects that we're not even using in
addition to the festival stuff we've
already built okay you can see on the
left-hand side node in the objects you
can individually select which objects
you want to see and the reason you'd
want to see them is you can view all of
the different fields the relationships
between these tables everything that you
might want to see around your schema
this is kind of like the blueprint of
your account okay so I just hit clear
all and all I really care about is
attendee like stage and Festival for now
right that's the stuff we've built and
let me zoom out so now that this is a
little less of a disaster and I would
just have these three things selected
this is pretty awesome
so we have festival here and I can move
it around if I want and then these
little line things that are apparently
master detail relationships yes you can
see that festivals are related to
attendees and stages and looking at that
little fork you can see that a festival
can have many attendees for ages seeing
this little like three these three
things on the side here yeah that little
triangle thing at the end cool okay so
this has this is great this is a visual
way to understand my schema yeah and as
your data model gets more complicated
it'll allow you to visualize it really
easily but in addition to that you can
add fields and yourself or create more
relationships straight from schema
builder okay
so I can just think I could add a banned
object right now you could you know why
don't you try that out see if you can do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
