program that finds the shortest path
from starts to go to do so let's give
the grid cell names we have six columns
name from 0 to 5 and 5 rows from 0 to 4
and the basic idea I'll pursue is that I
keep a list of nodes that I wish to
investigate further or as we called in
search expand let's call this list open
so in beginning we have only one state
on this list at 0 0 my initial state and
just to make sure I never picked this
state again I don't want any cycles in
my path let me just check mark the state
with a little write check I now can test
whether this state is my final goal
state obviously it's not I'm not done
with planning yet so I do next I'll
expand this state so take it off my open
list and look at all the successors of
which they are 2 over here 1 0 and 0 1
those two are now expanded so I'll check
them in one last thing I maintain for
each of these states on the open list
how many expansions it took to get there
so this was 0 over here is the one for
these two states in red that's called my
G value when I'm done with planning this
will be the length of the optimal path
let's now go further and expand one of
the two we always expand the one with
the smallest g-value but these are
equivalent they both have a G value of 1
so doesn't make a difference so let me
expand the first one it's this one over
here this one has three neighbors 0 0 1
1 and 2 0 but because 0 0 is already
closed with a check mark we don't
consider it anymore which gives me 2 0
and 1 1 both now with a G value of 2 and
we check those over here I now pick the
node on the open list with a smallest
g-value which happens to be this one
over here there's really no choice
it's the node over here and this has two
neighbors 0 0 and 1 1 but both already
checked so therefore there's no
expansion that takes place I only expand
if I find an unchecked node so the new
open lists are these two nodes over here
and our records
and what's gonna happen is my notes will
expand gradually into the free space
until I eventually hit the go note and
without proof the G value of when I hit
the goal node will be exactly the number
of steps it takes to go from the start
state to the goal node the secret here
for that to be the case lies in the fact
that I always expand the note were the
smallest g-value but we won't worry
about this what I want you to do is to
implement a piece of code that
implements what I just described and to
warn you this is a bit of work here's my
coding environment my grid is this one
over here is the same as the grid over
here you can see the obstacles here and
the T shaped obstacle over here our
starting location is zero zero which is
the first one you put on the open list
our goal happens to be four five which
is the coordinate of the cell over here
starting counting of course at zero zero
I've also coded for you the four
potential actions into a single field
called Delta so that when you go through
the different successors and the lists
in the search you can just go through
these sequentially the first one goes up
by subtracting one from this dimension
the second one goes left third one goes
down fourth one goes right ignore for
know the names of these actions I will
use them later and I want to use the
cost function of one so at each step
cost you exactly one for now so I'd like
you to write a piece of software that
outputs Triplets of this type where the
first value is the G value and the next
two are the coordinates x and y it then
retrieves the element with the smallest
g-value from the list expands it the
grid cells 0 0 gets expand into 1 0 and
0 1 the G value is incremented to 1 in
both cases and then as I scroll down a
little bit now takes again one of the
items with the smallest g-value breaking
ties whichever way you want to break
them there's a tie over here I just
happen to take the second one expand
this one into a new successor the only
one that's not checked yet in the table
is one one which gets a G value of 2
now remove again the element with the
smallest g-value which is not the first
one
so it's being taken down from the list
over here to produce a new open list
that's sitting over here and as it goes
through this I'm gonna scroll down a
little bit more you can see these
different elements being taken you can
see the G value keeps going up three
four and so on all the way to seven year
and at the very end when the G value
turns 11 it should expand note 3 5 which
is this one over here find its only non
check neighbor which is V f4 5 this guy
over here and add it to the list with
the G value of 11 when it then looks at
the remaining list and picks the one
with the smallest g-value which is this
one over here
it should identify that this is actually
the gold state and call the search a
success now this is all intermediate
debugging output what I want your code
to output just for us to check is just
the final triplet of the G value and the
coordinate of the very last item that is
being retrieved this is the path length
over here and this is the coordinate of
the goal which is the same as 1 over
here so I want you to write the code to
only output this one triplet over here
so your quote should output to this grid
over here 11 4 5 and 4 5 is the Gold
coordinates there's nothing interesting
here but the 11 is the key thing so it
takes 11 steps to go from here to here
if I change this for example by opening
up this grid cell over here it now takes
two steps less and I'm gonna see the 9
over here if instead I force a great a
detour
I see now a 15 over here for this maze
where you have to go down left up again
and down again
and if there's no way to reach the goal
point as is the case if a blocker this
entire area over here then I want the
program to output fail the signal would
fail
please implement this using the
algorithm idea that I've just given you
and it's going to be difficult it's
going to take you a while but if you do
this you're almost where I want you to
be to learn about a star</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
