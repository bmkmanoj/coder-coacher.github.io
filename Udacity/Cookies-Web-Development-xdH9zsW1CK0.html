in the browser for a website and by
small I mean less than four kilobytes
and in practice we're only talking about
a hundred bytes just the small you know
really just a string it takes the format
conceptually of something like this name
equals value and in practice it might
look something like this user ID equals
one two three four five cookies are
really commonly used for things like
user IDs and and you know kind of
temporary information that that a
browser wants to store you know whether
you're logged into a website you know
generally you have a cookie that
represents the fact that you're logged
in as user you know one two three four
five so to kind of draw you a little
picture of how these things fit together
you know we might have your browser and
it makes requests you know to some web
servers and the web server might send
back in its response some cookie data
and this is in the form of an HTTP
header and then your browser basically
just stores this cookie it's associated
with this website we'll talk more about
that shortly and then every time your
browser makes a request to this website
in the future now that it has this
cookie it will it will send the cookie
back to the server so you know if you're
logging in you know you might you might
post some form here and the server might
respond with okay you know welcome to
our website your user 1 2 3 4 5 and then
on every future request you say hey I'm
user 1 3 3 4 5 and that's how the
website knows that you're logged in and
a cookie you know it's just basically a
file that your browser stores generally
you can store about about 20 cookies per
website now this is basically up to the
browser it's some sort of it's a browser
limitation another limitation is
probably the length of the cookie which
we said is less than 4 K but in reality
you know this is this is 5 bytes and
we're probably you know mostly cookies
are gonna be storing are not you know
thousands of bytes another limitation is
a cookie has to be associated with a
particular domain so you know a cookie
for udacity.com is only sent to
udacity.com and and udacity.com can only
set cookies for udacity.com so it's each
website has you know a few cookies that
it can store that are private to that
website a lot of this depends on the
browser to behave properly so you know
this 20 cookies per website that's an
old in
an explorer limitation honestly I don't
know what the limit is for modern
browsers but if you're storing more than
20 cookies on a particular domain could
probably rethink things a little bit you
know maybe store more data in you know a
single cookie the four kilobytes again
there's so many things that can go wrong
when you start sending big cookies that
are you know 4,000 bytes long you know
you can set some browsers don't handle
multi-line cookies properly some web
servers don't handle multi-line cookies
properly so I would suggest keeping it
short and simple and and most of our use
cases are for storing small pieces of
data that you don't want to store in a
database it's easier to just store them
in a cookie or you know small pieces of
you know temporary data that is only
relevant to this particular user in this
particular browser right now now this
this constraint you know a cookie being
associated with particular website is
important it prevents you know me from
you know the cookie is is what makes me
be logged in at a lot of websites so if
another website could Forge this cookie
or read this cookie you know they could
pretend to be me on another website you
know they could steal my login
information so cookies the the domain of
cookie belongs to is really important
but it's up to the browser to enforce
those rules and sometimes browsers have
bugs you know none of the modern ones do
I can't remember last time that happened
but you know it's just something to be
aware if these are this is all kind of
browser side you know client side
enforced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
