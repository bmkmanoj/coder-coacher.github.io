originally from Germany as you can hear
and I'm emeritus professor here at
Stanford and also senior medical
director 23andme well thank you very
much for being here we've been talking a
lot and learning a lot about the genome
what it's made of and right now we've
been focusing on how big it is and we've
learned that there are about three
billion base pairs in the human genome
there's a lot of research that's gone on
for a long time and we're hoping you can
maybe shed some light on what we know
about the research that led to us
understanding how big the genome is in
sort of where we are now you know there
were early estimates of the size of the
genome simply by measuring the amount of
DNA in a Cell people could do that a
long time ago and so the estimate was in
that range of three billion base pairs
but the idea to actually sequence it was
came up in the mid 80s when capillary
sequencing was developed and many people
thought it was a absolutely crazy idea
because it's so huge so much information
and it was also known that there was a
lot of repetitive DNA in it so people
that is it really worth it to find the
genes that are really important in this
huge huge amount of information but then
when it was agreed upon to embark on it
as an international venture it was also
decided that we're not going to do with
just the human we also want to do model
organisms that people work on in the
laboratory like the round warms a fruit
fly and then could compare the human and
the animal information at the same time
and at that time we already knew that
the relative genome sizes of these
different animals were different at the
time right yeah that was already known
and the other thing to know what's Human
Genome Project when it finally got
started about nineteen ninety the first
five years were devoted to just mapping
the chromosomes you know people heard
about chromosomes and we know that DNA
runs in chromosomes from one end to
another so it would make sense logical
sense to start sequencing at one
and then go through but instead what
people did they made maps of the
chromosomes and then you could focus in
on specific region and draw the
sequencing there and also to find genes
that are located in specific chromosome
regions so instead of having just sort
of like you say sequence from one into
the other you could have many starting
places in the middle of a chromosome and
sort of read out from there right and
you could relate the sequence to the
chromosomal features because chromosomes
when they are treated with a certain
agent display banding patterns that are
very unique therefore we can identify
each chromosome individually which is
something you cannot know when they are
uniformly stained and also we can see
within each chromosome there are certain
regions and now we can find out in which
region certain genes are located and all
of this physical mapping as it's called
was done before the sequencing even
started so what happened when the
sequencing project started you mentioned
it was an international collaboration
was this really countries all over the
world or were they more from one region
or another whether were countries who
had developed infrastructure to take on
such a big project and in Europe it was
predominantly the UK France and Germany
and Canada was a player as well as Japan
and China and all of these people got
together under the chairmanship so to
say of Francis Collins who is now the
director of the NIH he was organizing
this big international thing and made
sure there wasn't too much waste and
duplication they were dividing up the
chromosomes ikea you do chromosome 21
okay that's where we are focusing on and
then they had regular meetings they
exchanged information all the results
were immediately shared and put online
and therefore because of this
international effort this led to success
ultimately and this obviously took a
period of time
imagine it sort of would stop and go at
different times you know how how does
this fit you know the this big initial
effort to sequence it um as far as a
timescale how long did it take well they
started in nineteen ninety and for the
first five years they did just mapping
and then it was slow to get seriously
into sequencing it was estimated that it
would be finished in 2005 but then in
the late 90s there was also a commercial
company called solera they said we can
do this even faster you guys are just
too slow we have better methods and we
can chop off the genome in small
sequences in sequences small pieces and
have the computers line it all up and
put it together and that's when a
serious race started because a company's
wetin that whatever genes they were
discovered they would patent and
therefore the medical benefits would go
to them rather than to the public and
therefore in 2000 both of them the
international caller consortium and the
company announced that they had a draft
sequence of the human genome this draft
was very imperfect it was full of holes
full of mistakes and then the
international consortium spend another
three years to finishing it up so in two
thousand sweet and they said okay
mission accomplished here is you had you
had a draft now where are we now with
sequencing the human genome or many
human genomes are we multiple drafts
beyond and are we reaching out to many
people you see the original genome that
was sequenced in the company it was
mostly the company CEO Quay cuentas in
Chino but the international effort had
many different people involved so the
genome was a composite of sequences of
many individuals and that's called the
reference genome but what you really
want to know is what is different
between the genomes of different people
who are live in different parts of the
world and that was the next effort and
to really sequence individuals with
known ethnic background and find out
what has a variation
between humans and that's when it really
became interesting and I took another 10
years to become really useful to have
that information um so what does the
size of a genome mean does it mean
anything at all well there are some
organisms with the huge genomes like the
salamanders you know and what is all
that sequence it's probably has no
informational content sometimes genomes
get big because viruses get in and they
replicate they make copies of themselves
and that has no useful function so there
is only a smaller part of the genome
that's really important because it has
function and this is something we're
still working on unraveling the
functions that was beautiful um I think
that's all I want to ask about genome
size so now as a natural segue we're
going to pick up into the coding regions
and I'm going to let you say all of it
I'm just going to try to set you up and
then let you talk about it and I'll just
to ask follow-up questions but you can
you can go back and forth much more
dialogue is shown with you me you know
I'd oh no that's fine um but you're
doing a great job talking so why don't
want to lecture you know well that's
okay I mean that sort of the the idea of
the interview even here is um I want you
to be free to tell the story but I'll
definitely ask questions yeah um so we
have three billion base pairs and just
one copy of the human genome and we've
learned that you know we have two copies
of the human genome of the nuclear
genome and our cells and we've been
learning a bit about the coding regions
the protein-coding regions what what can
you tell us about the relative size of
the protein-coding regions of the genome
versus the sort of non-coding regions
this was of course a motivation to start
we want to find out all protein coding
genes because these other ones initially
considered the most important part and
as you know the protein coding genes are
divided into exons and introns and only
the exons have the actual information
for the amino acid
just been covered in the course oh well
hold on actually let me think for a sec
no this is lost Henry okay so we don't
know that yet okay so the big question
was how many protein coding genes are
there in the genome and initially before
the genome project yeah the number
that's been kicked around was like a
hundred thousand sort of a wild guess
and then between two thousand and two
thousand sweet there was an official
betting game going on where people could
put on a dollar and the number and then
the years later it was five dollars and
then it was twenty dollars because
animals became more difficult and
everybody could only put down one bit
about 150 people put down a bit and they
arranged the ranges of their guesses
went from you wouldn't believe it 25,000
to 150,000 so nobody had really any good
ideas you mean was around 60 1,000 genes
and when the first draft was published
they said why we had a brief look at it
and we think it's between 30 and 35
thousand and when it was finally
finished the number had come down to 20
to 25,000 and many people were surprised
because this is hardly any mores and the
round warm was a fruit fly so the humans
are so much more complex shouldn't they
have more protein coding genes right but
there was a mechanism how you can have
make many proteins from one gene and
this is called alternative splicing you
are going to get to this later in the
course that means you can take bits and
pieces from one gene and you put them
together differently and then they
encode different proteins so the
complexity cannot be immediately deduced
from the number of genes when you don't
know what these genes can be used for so
what percentage of the genome is
actually made up of coding region
roughly it's only one to two percent and
so all this other you know 90 98 and 99
percent then I mean a lot of people who
you know just learning about the genome
may be wondering what exactly is the
rest of that sequence doing you see
originally people thought it was just
junk it was just a virus getting in and
replicating itself and in recent years
people started to look at how much of
that sequence is being made into RNA how
much is being transcribed and to
everyone's surprise more than eighty
percent is actually made into a copy of
RNA and these our knees have all kinds
of interesting functions for example to
regulate activity of other genes to
regulate the activity of messenger RNAs
how they are being translated and many
different functions that the rnase have
some of them are structural I mean there
are RNA said as structural components of
the ribosome and otherwise outside of
the coding sequence their control
regions that are important to regulate
the activity of each gene see so we
learn in this lesson about messenger RNA
mrna and so what you're saying there are
actually other kinds of RNAs that can be
made besides mrna that doesn't get
turned into protein that's right and
what was found out recently that you
remember there are two strands in the
DNA and the messenger RNA is only made
of one strand that gives the information
for the protein but what is being found
out now is that there are anti-sense
rnase but actually the other strand of
DNA can also be made into Arnie it goes
in the opposite direction it has no
coding function for proteins usually not
sometimes it does but it has regulatory
function when you just can imagine if a
gene is transcribed in the other
direction then the transcription of the
messenger RNA has a problem you know it
runs into it's a train wreck white so
there is a regulation of gene activity
by antisense RNA that's one mechanism
right so it sounds like maybe some of
the complexity of different species or
the complexity of cells is in part not
so much the sheer content the number of
genes you have but maybe how you
regulate all of those jeans
together to create something what we are
finding out now is that the genome
equations communicate with each other
that you can have an enhancer region
that is downstream away from the gene or
even in an intron of another gene but
then folds over communicates with the
promoter and sets in motion the
messenger RNA synthesis so the whole
genome is three-dimensional it's not
just one dimensional series of letters
it has a lot of sui dimensional
arrangement and interaction that's very
important for its function will actually
talk a lot or a little bit more about
that in Lesson four hopefully you
mentioned exons and introns which are a
part of mrnas and the exons are the
coding regions the actual parts that get
turned into protein and we seem to
learned in our little time spent with
the material that the exon seem much
smaller in general than the introns the
introns seem to be very big a lot of
times do we know anything about the size
of exons and introns and sort of how or
why that exists there was a huge
variation in intron size some can be
very small and some can be absolutely
huge and we don't know exactly why that
is the last exon is usually larger than
the other exons because it contains the
signal to stop and then it the
untranslated region which is important
for regulatory purposes and introns in
the middle of the gene they can be tiny
or can be bigger and we don't know
exactly why I don't understand why it
evolved this way so what are we still
learning in general about the genome and
the coding in the non-coding regions are
there any really important concepts or
new findings that you think are really
interesting that we're learning about
either the size of the genome or not so
much the size but the number of coding
regions the amount of coding region how
it interacts what we're learning about
the genome is more about a function of
the non-coding regions you know there
for example
nuclear rnas these are small armies that
are part of a part of the nucleus that
are encoded in introns and they are
encoded in introns when the internist
equated these little ironies are
released and they have very important
functions in the body and this was found
out like every search we did in our lab
when we compared the human and the mouse
the exome sequences did not code for
protein and they were not at all
conserved and the intron sequences were
conserved because that's why the
functional units are located so they're
all kind of surprises you know you
shouldn't only think the exons important
the intron is junk and gets thrown away
no it can be the opposite um you also
mention repetitive DNA when you were
talking about some of I guess the
historical context of the genome and
even once we sequenced it if anyone does
any research on their own they might
find that there's still a lot of
repetitive regions what do we know about
those in the genome you know most of
them are just remnants I mean they were
copies made of some early viral intruder
and now they are degenerated their bits
and pieces of them but there are still
some active copies and what they can do
they can still make copies of themselves
and they can jump around and insert
somewhere else in the genome and
actually cause problems they can cause
disease by inserting into an important
protein coding genes so we are not done
with dealing with all these repetitive
sequences they're still changing and
that means there was huge variability
from one person to another as well I
think that's an amazing concept to to
think about our genomes we sort of think
of them as okay we have the statics
genome and it may interact with itself
to create a protein or regulation but
the genome itself is changing even today
like you said these excited moving
element study living what am I just name
it oh so when people talk about
variation in the human genome we
oftentimes talk about single nucleotide
variants which will come to an ladder
lessons for our course is that the main
kind of variation that exists in the
human genome are these single letter
differences or their other
variation that are important too we have
identified about 15 million single
letter differences but so by sheer
number there is a most common but then
there are other variants they are called
copy number variations well who chunks
of the genome can be repeated and they
can be present in is a two or three or
many copies and there are differences
between human beings so some people have
two copies on her five some may have 12
and if you look at the total number of
nucleotides involved in those then this
is more common so the individual copy
number variants or CNVs are fewer than
the ones we have identified for snv's
but if you look at the amount of genomic
sequence involved in this type of what's
called structural variation it involves
a larger part of the genome I see so
between single nucleotide variants and
copy number variation those are the two
main kinds or the two main forms of
variation in humans yeah then there are
others like inversions where certain
pieces of the genome can be turned
around in some people and not another
and even translocations how viable are
translocations and do they get
propagated at all in a population over
time or most translocations enviable
well we find some in families you know
there are balanced translocation where a
piece of a chromosome is taken off and
hooked somewhere else or two pieces have
been exchanged and as long as they are
balanced meaning that the right number
of genes is there people are fine they
would know about it unless the break is
in a gene but that's pretty unusual the
break is most often in a repetitive
sequence but then when these people may
have children because of what happens in
meiosis that the chromosomes align and
cross over it's possible that a child
inherits a chromosome that only has an
extra copy and is then get the other one
that's missing something and you have an
unbalanced translocation and that can
cause very bad developmental defects
intellectuality a deficit
these are the children who we see in the
clinic and we look at their chromosomes
and look at their parents and we see the
translocation has been passed on so
several generations already but
otherwise they don't blast in
populations well you were just touching
on something that I want to us to move
on and talk about for lesson 12 now I
want to know a bit more about your
background and your experience you have
a lot of experience with human genetics
and both in research but also clinically
looking at families and individuals of
with various phenotypes I'd like for you
to start maybe tell us when you first
fell in love with genetics and when you
started studying and sort of your
journey to where you are today as a
Stanford professor I went to medical
school in Germany and then I trained in
pediatrics I came to this country to
train at Los Angeles Children's Hospital
and then I had to think about what else
to do and what I really wanted to do was
endocrinology because i love
biochemistry I thought biochemistry was
the best thing in medical school but I
couldn't get in as a foreign medical
queria and genetics was just in the
beginning started to get interesting it
was at the time where it became possible
to identify chromosomes x chromosome
banding and they want many people going
into that field which had a great
advantage because as a fellow at UCLA in
human genetics I was allowed to do
anything I could learn chromosomes
biochemical genetics as well as see the
patients on the wards where people said
Oh what is this my formation is it a
syndrome is a genetic will it happen
again so the training involved from the
beginning clinical genetics and then
other subspecialties of genetics and
then I was going to say I'm so do you
were able to interact and I guess
medical school and beyond as you were
sort of discovering the area that you
were sort of going to focus on
for for genetics at the same time were
you able to experience the clinical side
of genetics as well all the time I was
active in clinical genetics for the last
thirty something years and what does
that involve exactly while in pediatrics
you're mostly focused on children having
problems so either children who inherit
something or children who get very sick
after they are born because they cannot
metabolize protein there's something
wrong in their metabolism or children
were certain birth defects children who
don't do while in school who I late
walking relate acquiring skills or have
neurological symptoms seizures so all
kinds of problems that people didn't
know what is this so there was a lot of
discovery to do we found out that
certain clinical phenotypes were
associated with chromosomal duplications
or deletions now that we could look at
chromosomes in higher resolution so that
was the first stage so in the 70s make
discoveries this way and now of course
whole genome sequencing is applied to
these children and when nobody had could
figure out what caused their problem you
look at the whole sequence and you can
find a change and that's been very
successful in the last couple years
since I high-throughput sequencing
methods were developed so the exciting
thing about my own career is a two-way
street it's always been to waste between
the clinic and the laboratory you see
somebody fascinating in the clinic and
you bring samples to the lab and you
tell your PhDs look this is what the
patient's look like and we have to
figure out what's going on here and that
gets everybody motivated when you learn
something in the lab you find a gene
like we found a gene for wet syndrome
and then you can figure out can we do
anything to help these patients now that
we have the gene we figure out its
function in the last few years we spend
a lot of time making mouse models
because we looked at diseases that
involved us into a nervous system and
you can't go into a human brain and take
a sample
better there are many ethical concerns
that I mean some people have part of the
brain removed because of some medical
indication and then of course you can
get it but what we did make mouse models
because the genome is very conserved
between the human and the mouse and even
though we're working with deletion
syndromes were part of a chromosome is
missing we can define wire in the mouse
genome that part is located it's got the
same genes in it take it out in the
mouse and then you have my set you can
study the development prenatally
afterwards take the brain cut it up look
at what's going on and this is what we
did mostly in while in this mill in your
mouth well it sounds like I mean this is
good good old-fashioned science really
good science and to people who aren't
familiar it sounds like detective work
you you sort of establish where you see
you make an observation and then you go
investigate I'm really shocked by even
still by the idea that the human in the
mouse genome are similar enough that
you're even able to do that can you
speak for a second about you know
working in genetics specially with human
genetic so there's so many limitations
about the constraints but also the tools
you have to answer certain questions for
people who may not be familiar with the
idea to the mouse in the human genome
are in fact quite some oil as the mouse
is such a youthful use useful organism
because mouse genetics has developed
parallel to human genetics and many
mutations and phenotypes were
spontaneously already detected in the
mass so you already knew there was a
mouse model for this disease and you
could go and study it right away and for
those were they did not arise
spontaneously the mouse is ideal because
you can manipulate the embryonic stem
cells you can introduce mutations in the
mouse that you know exist in the human
therefore you make a mouse model that
exactly replicates biochemically what's
in the human the mice don't always have
the same phenotypes obviously because
they have a much smaller brain and many
other differences right but they're
similar enough that when you
look at those differences or the what
happens when you change the genetics of
the mouse you can then adapt that back
to the clinic sometimes well sure you
can also use the mouse to try out any
drugs that you may come up as any ideas
you have for treatment you can give it
to the mouse and see whether there is an
effect
so in your time in your clinical and
research experience what what area did
you focus on more specifically what what
would you say is your general research
subject there were too many to mention I
really started out with whatever was
possible to do at the time you know I
was in a way it Reverend by technology
that was being developed and I saw where
this technology could be applied to the
problem so it started with cytogenetics
in the area of banding chromosomes that
was in the 70s and then biochemical
genetics somatic cell genetics meaning
that you can fuse cells from different
organisms and you can map chromosomes so
in the beginning of the genome project
we were very much invested in mapping
genes to chromosomal regions with the
idea if you have a gene that's been
cloned and you know the function your
map at your chromosome region where we
already know a certain disease gene has
been mapped then becomes a candidate
gene for this disease and that was a
useful approach in the early 90s and
then as all these other technologies
became available to study global gene
expression patterns and during mouse
modeling and we then we moved to
studying individual diseases like wet
syndrome and Roberts and Roma so my
formation syndrome and ultimately i
sought the deletion syndromes where you
take out a chunk of chromosome and would
be interesting because there are many
different genes india and which of these
genes contribute to what part of the
phenotype i found that fascinating and
this was the projects we are working on
in the end so it's a stepwise process of
discovery that makes use of the
technology as it is being developed so
you can say it's opportunistic yes it is
ultimately my goal was always to find
some treatments for some of these
genetic diseases that we see in the
clinic was one of your most exciting
on discoveries in research well in the
clinic would do you have a favorite idea
our time or story yeah the most exciting
was the snow rnase this small nuclear
RNA z today in introns because this is a
syndrome called father villa syndrome
and what it looks like is the children
are born very floppy and very difficult
to feed and what happens after a while
they get stronger and they start eating
and everybody is happy finally Jimmy
itches food and they start eating too
much and they become massively obese if
you don't watch it in no time so the
problem was what is going on with these
children and we try to make a mouse and
to find out the deletion was quite large
four and a half megabases several genes
in it and we found out there's many
different things I can't explain in the
short time but that it's actually the
snow early that is responsible we made a
mouse model taking our justice no only
from the introns and these mice they
don't get obese but they don't stop
eating so it's a signal that tells you I
had enough it's a satiety signal that's
missing the children's it they don't eat
very fast they just keep eating eating
with the most of the same thing so you
were able to essentially sort of
discover the genetic underpinning of
that is there on any treatment that you
were able to do anything with from not
as many people are now working on this
we made them mice we let them we
distribute them to everybody who works
on obesity I mean you can imagine you
figure out how this knot is what has a
gene they are actually regulating what
are the mechanisms of action for the
Sonoran ease we don't know that yet and
so we hope that ultimately a treatment
will come out not only for this rare
condition called Prada really syndrome
but maybe four people have a problem
with appetite around the world what do
you think is the most difficult part of
your research that you've done in
general speaking before maybe research
in general what do you think is the most
difficult part
okay not technologically difficult but
in terms of managing and handling yeah
the most difficult part is if you feel
you get unfair reviews if there is
competition with things going on in the
background you know reviews of papers
and grants are anonymous and so you
sometimes get reviews back that you
think are totally unfair and there's
nothing you can do you don't know who's
shooting from where right so that is the
hardest part collaborations with people
you know you can manage you know you can
sometimes they go sour but at least you
know the person you can sit down and say
hey let's straighten this out we had a
difference and now we're friends again
right and if it's anonymous um you don't
hear you can't really defend yourself
sort of off camera or on camera I know
there are a lot of people who are
pushing for um to make peer review not
anonymous oh yeah they want it to be so
that you can actually you know call
someone else to hey that wasn't a fair
with you it's much more constructive for
example I work for journal called Phe
Phe er ery hour Jay it's an open access
journal where the people who are queer
to review a great to make it make
themselves known and then the whole
correspondence between the reviewers and
the original manuscript and then the
revision and everything is going to be
online so people can actually learn what
happened during this review and how did
this reviewer improve the paper so the
reviews you get back are really
constructive they give you all kinds of
good ideas what as you can do to make it
better right so is thinking about um
what you do as a career what do you
think the future is for people who are
interested in being clinicians and
bridging the gap between you know people
and the research that can help them do
you think there's going to be a bigger
opening and in the future for people who
want to want to do something similar
well there isn't definitely a need and
there are many opportunities but the
drawbacks are in genetics for example we
don't have enough people coming into
medical genetics out of the bed is
inside because in genetics you don't
make any money we don't have procedures
week honest don't stick tubes into
people that we can charge for it's all
cognitive you know you spend a lot of
time going so complicated information
searching the literature sitting down
with the family counseling them you
don't get a reimburse much for this and
therefore it's not attractive not if not
for people who went to american medical
schools and to enter a career as a
medical geneticist so we have a shortage
and many of the most successful people
are foreign trained medical medical
doctors so don't have to pay for their
medical education we hopefully have a
very large international audience you
know participating in our course what
would you say to a student or in a
lifetime learner who's watching and is
really interested in the subject may
even be interested in thinking about
this as a career what advice would you
give them I mean I can only say this has
been a lifetime learning experience to
be part of genetics during those decades
when everything developed and we are not
done yet I think it goes on and will be
even more exciting there are many
secrets in the genome that are yet to be
unraveled and both PhDs and MDS should
consider this and then genetic
counseling that's a whole new career
path we have a training program here at
Stanford for genetic counselors the
master's program because you don't have
to have a PhD or MD to tell people this
is what we found in your sequence and
this is what it means and these people
are trained specifically to do that and
we'll need a ton of lots of so I want to
encourage people to consider this as a
career great um as all the questions I
have do you want to talk about your
affiliation with 23 mate at all or do
you want to just sort of leave it as the
Stanford I'm connection I think I'd
rather do this as a standard
um well I'll open it up to you is there
anything else either about the genome
subjects or about you know doing if you
ask me on 23andme that would be another
half an hour yes as a lot going on at
23andme that I find exciting and why did
I decide to work with them all I've ever
worked with them it's a you don't
want all of this was there anything else
without the genome of the genome size
anything like I'd love to know like when
you teach genetics in the classroom what
do you what do you say to students to
get them excited about genetics and the
genome mmm but student what students
want to find exciting is often the
applied part you know bioengineering now
that we find out the things about plants
and and what can we do to improve food
supply for the world by a genetic by
bioengineered genetic engineering and
also making models for diseases he said
the mice are just used as a matter of
convenience because they were already a
genetically well studied organisms the
smallest mammal but you would much
rather have larger organisms and now
they are being able to make whole organs
of the pig for example in in vitro more
or less I mean the all of this this
developments I am I exciting so I talked
about induced pluripotent stem cells how
you can make different cell types and
organs from fibroblasts and how you can
study diseases in a dish you know paper
patient with Parkinson disease we can
take a skin biopsy make these cells into
neurons and then study the mechanism
that in the brain gives these people
Parkinson's disease and those outside of
the genome itself I talked about
repetitive sequences and they find this
boring it's exciting yeah I was going to
say um I find it the the evolution of
the genome itself is just fascinating
and I'm really intrigued by how people
use genetic information to
back in time to sort of look at
connections my eyes the lab I in
undergrad I worked in a yeast yeast lab
it was really interested in the
phylogenetics of specifically they are
the c-terminal domain of RNA polymerase
2 um it's very conserved from yeast you
know this know our knees okie have it
already I'm sorry architecture stories
yeah these are ancient you know there
was an early world before DNA even came
in existence yeah no it's it's
fascinating it i think i think um maybe
something i do want to get this on
camera um as a geneticist human or
otherwise how do you know something's
important is it the fact that you see it
conserve and many different species or
is there something else that that goes
on that tells you okay this sequence or
this event is really important but if
defines what you think is important if
you are interested in the evolution than
anything that traces back to a lower
organisms and is conserved is
interesting what changes through
evolution are interesting because then
you can understand the underpinning of
evolution but if you want to find out
what makes human so special why do we
have language why do we have ethical
considerations then you look for
something that you only find in humans
and not in in other organisms so it
depends what's interesting to you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
