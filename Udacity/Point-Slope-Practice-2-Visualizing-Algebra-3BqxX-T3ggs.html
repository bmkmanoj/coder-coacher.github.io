by finding the slope I'm going to label
this point x1 y1 and this point x2 y2
for y2 i plug in 5 4 y 1 i plug in
negative 1 and 4 x2 i plug in negative 2
and finally for x1 we plug in 3 5 plus
one makes 6 and negative 2 minus 3 is
negative 5 so we have negative six
fifths as our slope now that we have the
slope we can use our slope formula again
and fix one of the points to be x and y
these two variables will appear in our
equation we can plug in negative six
fifths and for the slope and then we can
use our other point 3 and negative 1 for
x1 and y1 that's this point here
simplifying the y minus negative 1 i get
y plus 1 now that we're here we want to
find an equation in slope-intercept form
so we want to solve this equation for y
i can multiply both sides by 5 times X
minus 3 we do this since 5 times X minus
3 is a common denominator for these two
fractions notice that we just have
factors that appear in the numerator and
also in the denominators this x minus 3
is just one factor we use these factors
to help us simplify we know 5/5 mix 1
and X minus 3 divided by X minus 3 also
makes one so we have X minus 3 times
negative 6 equals y plus 1 times 5 we
could have gotten to this step just by
cross multiplying negative 6 times X
minus 3 on the left and five times y
plus one on the right pretty cool i just
read with the negative 6 to the x and
the negative 3 and i distribute the 5 to
the y and the positive one our goal here
is to get y by itself so let's isolate
this 5y term we can subtract 5 from both
sides to get negative 6x plus 13 equals
5 x y and then we divide both sides of
our equation by 5 so i have negative six
fifths times x on the left plus 13
fifths equals 1 y it's probably best to
continue solving down the page I just
wanted to show our work all in one place
i can rewrite this fraction as negative
six fifths times x we know
multiplication and division have the
same priority in the order of operations
I could do multiplication and in the
division or I could do division and then
the multiplication
these two are exactly the same finally
we can just flip our equation around to
get our answer in slope intercept form
we can check one part of our answer we
calculated the slope to be negative six
fifths earlier in our problem well sure
enough we get negative six fifths and
our answer we know this part of the
problem should be correct so long as our
calculation from above what's correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
