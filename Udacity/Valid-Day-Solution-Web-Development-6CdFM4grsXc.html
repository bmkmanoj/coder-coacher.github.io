my version of the solution we take in
day from the user first thing we need to
do is we need to check if day is a
number or not remember everything we get
from or we get in our web app it's going
to be strings all the the HTTP and our
web app doesn't know whether the users
typing in numbers or strings or whatever
so we get all strings and we have to
make sure our string is made up of
digits that's what this is digit
function does before we convert it to an
integer which is what the int type does
here when we call it as a function so
nowaday here will be an integer and if
it's between 0 and if it's greater than
0 on less than or equal to 31 we return
it and you can see down here I've run it
on 25 and we got 25 let's try some of
the error cases
I'll try 0 we'll run that our function
returns none which is what we expected
if I type in you know foo one of our
test strings we'll run that and we get
none again and let's try a correct date
again 31 we'll run that okay all as well
now we could have made this more
complicated by also taking the month and
then you know making sure that we you
know February has only 28 days and and
you know March has 31 and that sort of
thing but we don't need to make this too
complicated I'm not trying to quiz you
on calendars I'm just trying to quiz you
on writing basic functions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
