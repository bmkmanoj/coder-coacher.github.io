to come in later are finally having
their meeting and well I should say
something about Carol's algorithm but
carol already has a bit more experience
with algorithms than Bob or Alice so she
has already figured out that a simple
algorithm that would just try all of the
possibilities of selecting certain
investment opportunities into her
portfolio is just not going to cut it so
Carol is really looking forward to
meeting Bob and figuring out some new
ideas so at the beginning of the meeting
alice is not there yet Bob and Carol
start explaining their problems to each
other so Bob is explaining to Carol how
among a set of genes some of which are
connected he is looking for groups where
every gene is connected to every other
gene and Carol of course explains her
problem where she is looking for
potential investments that are not
connected to each other such as this one
here now in order to not have to talk
about genes and investments anymore we
should use some common terminology for
both of those problems and if you're
already had an algorithms course you
might have come across a structure known
as graphs and graphs are basically just
objects that are connected to each other
so the network up here that would be
called a graph and the network down here
would also be called a graph this here
the object would be called a vertex and
of course this this and all of these
objects here are vertices so this would
also be your vertex here either the
purple of the green ones and then the
connections are called edges so all of
the blue connections are some of those
that I've colored green here every
single one of them is an edge so an edge
always connects two vertices and the
whole structure is called a graph and if
you use that terminology you can state
the problems that Bob and Carol are
working on using a similar language so
Bob's problem is basically taking as
input a graph with n vertices and the
output that he's looking for and we have
to make this bubble a big bit that
for that the output is basically looking
for is the largest set of vertices all
connected to each other we'll also make
the bubble for Carol a bit bigger to
state her problem so what Carol is
looking for again the input is a graph
with n vertices and the output is the
largest set of vertices not all
connected to each other but none
connected to each other so as you can
see when once we use the common
terminology the problem that Bob is
working on is actually very very similar
to the one that Carol is working on the
only difference is Bob is looking for a
set of vertices where all are connected
to each other and Carol is working on a
problem where none of the vertices are
connected to each other but everything
else is the same you're given a graph
with n vertices you're looking for the
largest possible set and all it's about
is the connections that these vertices
have to each other so in the future to
be better able to talk about these
problems will also give them names as we
do with most problems also so that we
don't always have to say this is Bob's
problem and this is Carol's problem what
we will call Bob's problem is a problem
named click because all of those
vertices are very closely connected to
each other just like in a clique of
friends for example and we'll call
Carol's problem independent set Carol is
basically looking for the opposite of a
closely collected click Carol is looking
four vertices that are not connected to
each other so if those were friends they
wouldn't know of each other so now after
Bob and Carol have explained their
problems to each other and given it the
name they notice since the only
difference between clique and
independent set is that in one we're
looking for all vertices to be connected
and in the other one we're looking for
none of the vertices to be connected
their problems are actually very very
closely related and I will show you the
idea that they come up with to figure
out how similar those problems are also
from an algorithmic perspective</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
