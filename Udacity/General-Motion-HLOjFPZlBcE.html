moving in the image okay this is this is
how they're moving in the world in order
to figure out how they're moving in the
image we have to go from world
coordinates to image coordinates okay
here's our simple equation for in a font
that's too small to read but it'll get
bigger in a minute it's okay
we're just gonna use straight
perspective projection we're gonna
assume the origin is in the middle we're
gonna assume nothing is skewed etc so
the only thing is is that we need to
know the focal length right so little X
is the focal length x big x over big z
same thing with y right that's our usual
perspective transformation okay that's x
and y but what about how x and y are
changing given how the points are moving
given the V in the world well it turns
out that's pretty easy we're gonna call
little u and little V here the velocity
and X and the velocity and Y so these
are just the derivatives in time so this
is how things are changed so U is the
velocity in x dx/dt y v is dy DT alright
well so to take the derivative of X with
respect to something in this case time
right how it's moving well you remember
the the formula for the derivative of a
quotient right meg is saying thank God
no I don't have to know these things
well it's just the derivative of the top
times the bottom minus the derivative
the bottom times the top all divided by
the bottom squared right right okay
that's what this is right here okay VX
that's that's the change that's the
velocity and x times Z minus the top x
times the velocity and Z divided by Z
squared multiplied by F that's just the
constant same thing down below okay then
we start to expand this stuff and we get
this nice little formula here okay so
when you look at it that's still kind of
ugly because you don't actually know
what V X V Z and V Y you know that
they're from back here well it turns out
you can write them pretty beautifully
for some twisted definition of beauty in
this very simple formula here 1 over Z
at some point XY times a times t plus
bxy of Omega and let me show you exactly
what that is okay so here I've rewritten
it so this is the motion so U is how
much it's moving at some point XY so we
know the point XY in the image the
question is how much motion are we
seeing so we've got the U and the V
that's the motion and X and the motion
and Y all right and what it does is this
formula relates the translation and
rotational component of the point out
there in the world these are world T and
world Omega 2 how it's moving in the
image okay thing to realize is that this
quantity a is just a function of things
we know we know we're assuming we know
the focal length the lens and if we're
at some point XY we know what that point
this is little X little Y this is the
location in the image cap X Kappa Y
Kappa Z out in the world little X little
Y in the image all right so you'll
notice that a is just this function B is
a little more complicated but it is
still just a set of things we know ok so
if you tell me some point and you tell
me the focal length I can tell you this
a matrix and this B matrix I might not
know T and Omega I might be wanting to
solve for T and Omega ok but a and B I
know everything of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
