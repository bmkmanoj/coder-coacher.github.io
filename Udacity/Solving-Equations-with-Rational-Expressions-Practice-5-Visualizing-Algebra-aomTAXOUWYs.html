great work if you found that one we
start solving this equation by
multiplying both sides by the LCD this
leaves us with two times X minus 8 minus
six x two x minus one on the left hand
side of the equation on the right hand
side will still have 0 since 0 times any
factors would still be zero next we
distribute and combine our like terms to
get negative 10x minus 10 equals zero we
rewrite the sign up here and then solve
for x we add 10 to both sides and then
we divide both sides by negative 10 this
gives us our final value of negative 14
the excluded values we want to look at
these two denominators to figure out
what X cannot equal we know X cannot
equal one-half or this denominator would
equal 0 likewise we know X cannot equal
positive 8 where this denominator would
be 0 as well our final answer is not one
of these excluded values so here's our
only solution negative 1 notice that
there's another way to solve this
equation if we move the second fraction
to the right side of the equation we
would have one fraction equal to another
we would just add this to both sides of
our equation next we would multiply by
the LCD or simply cross multiply to get
this next equation after distributing
and solving for x we would find X would
be equal to negative 1 if you use this
method that's great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
