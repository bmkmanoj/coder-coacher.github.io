faster well let's think about why it was
so slow right the reasonable it was so
slow is that we were doing this for loop
we're going through all the elements in
order and we're checking if they match
the keyword and we had to do this going
through the entire index for an entry
for a keyword that's not in the index to
determine that it's not there we had to
go through the whole index this is not
the way we use indexes in real life
right if you're looking for a word in
the index of a book you don't have to
look through every single entry to see
if that word exists you can jump around
it and the reason you can jump around is
because the entries in index are sorted
they're sorted in alphabetical order so
you know where that entry would belong
you just need to find the right place
and see if it's there so we could do
that with our index instead of having
our index kept in arbitrary order if we
kept our index in a sorted order then we
could find the place where that entry
belongs and look for it
sorting is a very interesting problem
it's something we're not actually gonna
talk about more in this class we're
gonna do a different way of doing that
what we're gonna do is find a way to
find where the entry should be that
doesn't require actually keeping all
entries sorted what we want is something
that will allow us given a keyword we're
going to have some function that tells
us where it belongs we're going to call
that a hash function that tells us where
in the entry to look and so instead of
having to look through the whole index
the hash function will tell us where
that entry belongs so what we need for
this is some function that's going to
take a keyword map it to a number and
that number is the position in index
where that entry belongs we could do
this lots of different ways one simple
thing would be to think well we know the
alphabet this is more like the way an
index for our book would work and we're
going to have for each entry and then
next we'll have based on the first
letter we'll put all the entries that
start with that first letter in the same
place so if we're looking for a key word
that starts with you doubt but for hash
would tell us to look into place where
all the words that start with you are
and then we'd only have to look through
the words that start with you so this
would allow us to do a lookup much
quickly than looking through the whole
index this isn't quite the best way to
do things right if we made our places
based on the letter well then we have a
problem if we have two words with the
same first letter certainly we expect to
have more than one word that starts with
the same letter so instead of having
just an element here for each position
we're gonna have a list of elements that
would be all the words that start with
you so when we look up the word Udacity
we would look in the entry for you and
if the word that's there doesn't match
then we know Udacity isn't in dinamics
there are lots of problems with this the
first problem is well there might be
more than one word that starts with you
so we can't just have one entry here
what we need to have is a list of
entries we often call this a bucket so
we need a bucket of all the entries that
start with you that would be in this
position so instead of having just one
entry like the old structure of our
index now we're going to have a list of
entries and each element of the index
will now be a bucket which is a list of
entries that are in the right position
this is gonna be our bucket of our all
the entries that start with you and that
would have all the different entries
that start with the letter U in that
bucket so this is getting better
now for each lookup instead of having to
look through all of the words in index
we just need to find the position that
starts with the right letter that's got
a bucket of all the words that start
with that letter and then we just need
to look through that bucket this works
okay but this doesn't really scale very
well at best if we have you know ten
million words well now instead of having
ten million entries to go through we
need to go through ten million divided
by say 26 if we have 26 letters it's not
making things much faster it's making
things maybe at best 26 times letter
that assumes that all of the buckets are
the same size certainly if we make the
buckets based on the first letter that's
not going to be the same size if the
words are typical English words we're
gonna have many more words that start
with s and t say then that start with u
so we want to fix those two problems we
want to be able to have more buckets so
we're not gonna just use the first
letter we're going to use some function
on the whole word that tells us where it
belongs and we're gonna try to make that
function distribute the words fairly
well
so the structure that I've described is
what's called a hash table this is a
very useful data structure it's so
useful that it's built into Python
there's a Python type called the
dictionary which provides this
functionality at the end of today's unit
I'll explain how the Python dictionary
works and how to use it and we'll modify
the search engine code to use dictionary
instead of the lookup table that we
built but before we do that we're gonna
implement it ourselves we're gonna make
sure that we understand how the hash
table works by writing all the code to
do it ourselves and then we'll switch to
using the built-in Python type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
