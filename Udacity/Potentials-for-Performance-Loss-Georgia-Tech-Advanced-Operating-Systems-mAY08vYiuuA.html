loss when you have a microkernel based
operating system design well the main
source of potential performance loss are
what are called border crossings as
we've seen before and border crossings
have both an explicit cost associated
with it as well as an implicit cost
associated with it the explicit cost is
the fact that from an application which
is at a particular protection level
namely the user level protection level
of the processor architecture you are
slipping into the microkernel and which
is at a different privilege level that
is the explicit cost in border crossing
and in order to accomplish a particular
service that an application has
requested the service is actually
provided by server processes above the
microkernel and therefore there are
border crossings involved going from the
application to the microkernel to the
particular service that we are talking
about let's say a filesystem service and
on top of that a system service like
filesystem may have to consult other
services such as a storage module or a
memory management module in order to
complete the requested service of the
application in which case that are going
to be protected procedure calls that are
going to be executed between services
that are part of the operating system
and these protected procedure calls
because they are going across address
spaces is going to be more expensive
than simple or normal procedure calls
and typically protected procedure calls
can be as expensive as 100x hundred
times normal procedure calls and this is
coming up because of the fact that each
of these services in a microkernel based
design is assumed to be implemented in
its own address space to protect the
integrity of each of these system
services now why are protected procedure
calls that much more expensive than
normal procedure calls this is where the
implicit cost of border crossing
and whether the border crossing happens
when we go from the user address space
into the kernel address space or between
one hardware address space representing
a particular system service to the
hardware address space of another system
service and that implicit cost is the
fact that we are losing locality both in
terms of address translations contained
in the TLB as well as the contents of
the cache that the processor uses in
order to access memory all of those add
up in making protected procedure calls
or going between user space and kernel
space that much more expensive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
