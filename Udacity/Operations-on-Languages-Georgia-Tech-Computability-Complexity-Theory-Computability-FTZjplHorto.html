language itself we wanted to find some
operations on languages and establish
some notation well illustrate using
these two languages over the zero-one
alphabet
since languages are sets we have the
usual operations of Union intersection
and complement for example a union B
consists of these three strings 0 from
both a and B 1 0 from a and 1 1 from B
döner section contains only those
strings in both languages just the
string 0 here to define the complement
of a language we need to make clear what
it is that we're completing it's not
sufficient just to say that it's
everything not in a for this particular
a that would include strings with
characters besides 0 and 1 or maybe even
infinite sequences of zeros and ones
which we don't want the complement
therefore is designed so as to complete
the set of all strings over the relevant
alphabet in this case the binary
alphabet usually the alphabet over which
the language is defined will be clear
from context in this case the complement
of a will be infinite including the
empty string not 0 however it will
include 1 will include 0 0 it will
include 0 1 it will not include 1 0
however it will include 1 1 it will
include 0 0 0 and so on and so forth for
all longer strings in addition to these
standard set operations we also define
an operation for concatenating two
languages the concatenation of a and B
is just all strings that you can form by
taking a string from a let's say X and
appending to it a string Y from B in our
examples the set a B would be 0 0 the
first 0 coming from a and the second
from B 0 1 1 with the 0 coming from a
and the 1 one coming from B and so forth
of course we can also concatenate a
language with itself as I've done here
in this example
instead of writing a a we often write a
squared and in general when we want to
concatenate the language with itself K
times we write a to the K power
note that for K equals zero this is
defined as the language containing
exactly the empty string when we want to
concatenate any number of strings from a
language together to form a new language
we use an operator known as clean star
this can be thought of as the union of
all possible powers of the language when
we want to exclude the empty string we
use the plus operator instead which
insists that at least one string from a
be used notice the difference in the
starting indices so for example this
string here is an a star there's a way
that I can break it up so that each part
is in the language a note that a star
doesn't include infinite sequences of
symbols each individual string from a
must be a finite length and you're only
allowed to concatenate a finite number
of those together for those who have
studied regular expressions this should
seem quite familiar
in fact one gets the notation for
regular expressions by treating
individual symbols as languages for
example zero star is the set of all
strings consisting entirely of zeros
will also commonly refer to Sigma star
meaning all possible strings over the
alphabet Sigma
