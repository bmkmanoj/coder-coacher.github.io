thinking about what to put into the next
three four or five generations of kuta
you know what's-what's foremost in your
mind what are the sort of
characteristics that you're thinking
about to pick design features that are
going to move kuda forward I'm really
focused right now on the heterogeneity
problem that is I've got this system
where I've got processes which are good
at one thing serial processing a process
which is good at another thing parallel
processing they're two separate
processes and they live with their own
separate execution spaces and memory and
hardware and all that kind of thing and
bridging that gap to make it easier for
the programmer to reason about what he
wants to do and to express what he wants
without having to fight the system that
that's really where I think that the
biggest advances need to be made so I'm
putting and spending a lot of time
thinking about memory models for example
making life easier for people who do
with you know you might not always know
what memory you need to move or you
might find it inconvenient and to figure
out how do I move data while I'm
computing on something else like all of
those types of things that you have to
think about in a heterogeneous system
I've anything I can do and I'm really
not sure what that is yet i'm still
going still working on this book i
really see the direction such that we're
at whatever whatever we can do to make
that easier will make the system easy to
program and i think inevitably in the
future there is that there is a place
where you've got specialist processors
working on the task for which they are
ideally suited because that gives you
the best performance for the power that
you've got the best performance for the
silicon that you put in there it
probably will solve your problem faster
you know if you've got a massively
parallel processor do your parallel work
on it but it means that you've now got
this space where the program is no
longer thinking about one type of
program he has to think about two or
three or four or however many disparate
things he's got and you know I've not
yet seen a great solution to this but
you know we're working towards to and
