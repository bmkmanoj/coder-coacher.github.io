puts the number of different concepts in
terms of how they're related to each
other so let's just sort of quickly look
at it from two sides people who rely on
computer systems and network systems
these are owners of the data that's
stored and the systems where the data is
stored they deploy those because those
are critical to what they do at the same
time we know that there are thread
sources and they're going to pose
threats to these systems that we're
talking about but one way we deal with
both the threat source and any
vulnerability that we may have is
deploying defenses owners obviously want
to reduce this risk and one way to do
that is to deploy the defenses that we
have in place and the risk is to the
online assets which are valued by the
owners that's sort of the picture on the
legitimate owners and what they do in
cyberspace in terms of the attackers or
the malicious actors threat sources they
basically increase risk to these online
assets that we have and that happens
because they exploit vulnerabilities and
launch attacks by doing that they wish
to profit and that's that's the way they
do it
the big picture is that at the center is
what is of value who poses a threat and
what do we do to somehow manage the risk
that we have for our online assets from
the threat sources but the key concepts
in cyber security
this diagram sort of nicely relates the
idea of threats vulnerabilities attacked
cyber risk and so on and how they're all
connected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
