let's see how we calculate that well
first we need to calculate the range of
the cannon how do we do that well let's
look at our initial velocity vector the
cannon fires at a speed of fifty six
meters per second at an angle of 45
degrees because that optimizes the range
now we want to break this into
components be 0 x and v 0y we can do
some trigonometry to show that the x and
y components are both equal to thirty
nine point six meters per second well if
I'm going to know how far this cannon
ball is going to go I should probably
know how long it's going to spend in the
air let's use the Y component velocity
to do that looking at the trajectory of
this ball I want to first find how long
it takes to get to the very top that's
when the vertical component velocity
will be equal to zero using this
equation and plugging in what we know
and remember in this case acceleration
is downward so negative we find it takes
three point nine six seconds to get to
the top of the trajectory which means it
will take another 3.96 to get down which
results in a total time of 7.9 two
seconds now we know in the x-direction
speed isn't going to be changing there's
no acceleration in the x-direction so if
i look at this equation this term goes
to 0 and we're left with this so what's
the range of the cannon how far can it
reach Delta X well it's just the X
component of velocity 39.6 times the
time which gives us 314 meters if you
got this far good work we're almost
towards the end now we just need to
convert this somehow into an angular
size well looking at this angle beta we
know this flagpole has a height of
thirty meters and in fact it looks like
we know the opposite and the adjacent
sides so we can write the tangent of
beta is 30 / 314 if i ask google what's
the arc tan of 30 / 314 in degrees
because remember that's how we go from
ratios two angles it gives me a value of
5.5 degrees good work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
