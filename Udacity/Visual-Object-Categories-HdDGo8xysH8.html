let's talk about what humans do and
visual object categories in humans and
there was work in what's referred to as
basic level categories in human
categorization it was stood started by
Eleanor OSHA series of seminal papers
back in the 70s continued on by Lake off
and other cognitive scientists and what
they found is there are certain levels
of description that seem to have a
preferred a place in human cognition so
for example the basic level was the
highest level in the category which you
could say that objects have the same or
similar perceived shape so I've asked
you to think of the shape of a German
Shepherd you can but if I asked you
think of a shape of a dog you probably
can do that too if I ask you to think of
the shape of a mammal what you're gonna
do is you're gonna think of the shape of
a couple of Representative types of
mammals you don't actually have a shape
for mammal typically also you can make a
mental image if I say you know make a
mental image of a dog you'll probably
come up with something if I say make a
mental image of an animal you're gonna
pick some animal and then if I were to
ask you what it was you wouldn't tell me
it's an animal you would tell me it was
a deer or something like that by the way
you can do reaction time experiments
where let's suppose you want to ask
people to push a button yes or no I'm
gonna show them a picture and one task
is you're supposed a isn't an animal
another task you're supposed to say
whether it's a dog it turns out you're
faster at knowing that it's a dog then
you aren't knowing that it's an animal
and that's a very robust funny and you
can you can do that and then there's
this thing that typically this is the
level of children understand earlier so
they'll learn about dogs before they
learn about animals they'll learn these
words and there's one you've written
here about having motor actions interact
you can imagine that there's a set of
things you do with dogs that sort of
span dogs right there's probably not the
same set of things you do with animals
right you probably pet dogs you probably
wouldn't pick most dogs probably all
dogs generically if you're a dog person
the idea is that you have these these
interactions so there's this preferred
level within the human and you might
wonder why I'm spending so much time
talking to you about this well if you go
to the MIT libraries and you were to
type in you could actually find this
thing called not natural object
categorization which by the way was my
PhD thesis back in nineteen
eighty-seven please don't go and read it
it's not so great but I was worried
about this notion of perceptual
organization and how you would organize
your categories to make them good for
perception the one thing I lucked out on
is that went by the time I did my thesis
the AI tech report through up to one
thousand one so I got tech report one
thousand one as the number and and
that's great because it sounded like it
was an important one or first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
