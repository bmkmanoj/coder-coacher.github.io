approximation and again we're assuming
that we're given an instance of a
knapsack which means we have n objects
and the sizes and the values of those
objects are given to us and you know
that the total sum of those values here
will call V so what we said now is that
we wanted to scale down all of these
values so we'll scale this down to V 1
over X and then round down and i'm going
to write the rounding down like this
which is called a floor symbol in case
you haven't come across that so i'm
going to write down the same thing here
so this is going to become v 2 over X
this year is going to be complete and so
on we're going to FV and over X so what
well you do use here for the X well of
course that takes a bit of either
playing around or pre-knowledge in this
case we'll set this X here and we're
going to set this to V over n times 1
minus C now you already know most of the
constants here so you know n n is the
number of objects and V is the sum of
all values now see is some value I'm not
yet going to specify to you we'll just
say for now that see lies between 0 and
1 now using these values here if you use
the knapsack algorithm using the table
my question to you is what is the
running time now of the knapsack
algorithm using these values here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
