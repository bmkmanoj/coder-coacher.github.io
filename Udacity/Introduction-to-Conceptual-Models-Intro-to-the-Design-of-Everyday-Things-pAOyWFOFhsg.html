please yeah that's a fancy teapot yeah
it's one of my favorites I'm sorry I
have had to illiterate I'd like a little
bit more than um well yeah why don't you
fill it and I wonder explain this
coffee pot sure so this is the joke it's
one of my favorite jokes it's sometimes
called the coffee pot for masochists
we've done originally by French artist
and this is a copy made just for me and
I've used of a cover of my books I love
it so much and you know it's what's nice
about it is obvious you grab the handle
it's obvious that's the spout but it's
also obvious that it's the wrong way it
won't work the conceptual model is clear
and it's clear that it's well that it's
a joke it's impossible on purpose what's
the matter
um are you doing well I it doesn't have
a place to fill so I'm not sure I
recommend that okay then the other
choice is at the bottom which I'm going
to try good
team cleric so far
that's a funny way to use a teapot yeah
that doesn't seem to work that's not the
way I used it before
hmm hey why doesn't the water drip out
look at that so how do you think it
works
what's your conceptual model the way it
works it's a mystery hmm it's supposed
to be a mystery it's called a puzzle
part the Chinese invented article about
400 years ago this is a copy and you're
right there's no obvious way to put the
water in you don't really want to put it
in there and you turn it upside down and
there's a hole sure but come on you pull
the water there you turn it upside down
the water will fall out so yet if I do
that look where does it how does it work
you're not supposed to be able to figure
out that's the whole point that's why
it's called a puzzle fine so this was
designed by a trickster hmm a good
designer and this is the challenge for
design we'll design things such that
somebody can have an effective
conceptual model and understand how it
works or go out of the way so you don't
have a model if in fact that's the goal
you know to fool you and the only way a
designer can communicate is through the
objects that they design and there is
the challenge and what this lesson is
about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
