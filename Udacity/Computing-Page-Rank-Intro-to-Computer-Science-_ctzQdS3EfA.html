computes the formula that we worked out
earlier that we want to compute the rank
for each page the thing that we're gonna
do instead of using this recursive
definition we're going to write a loop
that goes through the time steps and
we're going to figure out how many times
steps we want the more time steps the
more accurate rankings we'll have but
the longer it will take so we'll just
pick a value for the maximum number of
time steps and we'll make our loop go
through those steps computing these
equations so let's work out the code to
do that so now that we've got the graph
all that's left to do is figure out how
to use it to compute the page ranks so
to do that we'll make a procedure called
compute ranks it takes as input a graph
that gives the link structure so as an
example we have our graph that has the
URLs and each URL followed by the link
of pages that it links to and this is
the graph that was produced by our
crawler and crawl web produced as
outputs a graph as well as an index
we're going to use the graph as the
input to compute ranks so the output
from compute ranks will be a dictionary
giving for each URL you rank the ranking
that we compute using our formula and
the higher the rank the better and what
we're gonna do once we have those ranks
and this last part is going to be left
as a homework assignment for you we're
gonna instead of having just look up
we're gonna have look up best and look
up best we'll take 3 inputs it will take
the keyword we're looking for it will
also take the index that came from the
crawl and we'll also tank the ranks and
from those three inputs the index will
give us all the pages that contain the
keyword and then what lookup best will
do was use the ranks to find the highest
ranked page and give that as the output
so once we've done that you'll have a
complete search engine you'll have a
crawler
that starts from a seed finds pages
produces an index produces a graph that
graph is the input to compute ranks
compute ranks uses our page ranking
algorithm to figure out the pages that
are most popular and then lookup best
takes the graph as they
put the indexes input and the keyword
finds the pages that contain that
keyword and identifies the one that's
best using the ranks so that's what
you'll have after the homework of this
unit we're gonna finish compute ranks
now and leave it up to you to define
lookup best as a homework question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
