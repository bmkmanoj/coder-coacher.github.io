digits that we've arrived at that is to
say the odd number of digits we just sum
up the even-numbered digits we sum up
these the results of these calculations
then we compute the value mod 10 that is
to say we just take the ones digit of
the Somme and if that value is equal to
0 we have a valid credit card number if
the value does not come out to be 0 then
it's invalid okay so that was the case
for an odd number of digits now let's
briefly look at the case for an even
number of digits and it's almost the
same so if we have an even number of
digits we go ahead and take the odd
number of digits double them the track 9
if the double number ends up being
tanner higher then after that the
process is the same we add them up take
the ones digit or equivalently take the
psalm mod 10 and see if the result is 0
so that is luns algorithm and the reason
that we need to go over that in a bit of
painstaking detail is because if you
want to generate valid credit card
numbers then you're going to need to
implement one's algorithm in order to do
that and so there's one little detail
that I left off and so what I just told
you is wait to check whether a number is
valid and what you're going to need to
do is create a valid credit card number
so you're going to be given the issue
are identifiers you're going to make up
the account number randomly then what
you're going to do is put a zero at the
end of the credit card number use lens
algorithm to compute the computed
checksum for it and the result of that
is unlikely to be zero if the checksum
comes out to be 0 then you've already
generated a valid credit card number if
it hasn't then you're going to have to
take 10 subtract the checksum from 10
and put whatever number you arrive at in
the place of the checksum digit where
you had 0 and now you'll have a valid
credit card number and I suggest that as
you're implementing this you check it so
you compute the lun number if it's not 0
you subtract it from 10 put that in the
checks on position and now you can go
ahead and compute the check some of the
entire credit card number and it needs
to come out 0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
