uiviewcontroller and you'll need to
import mobile core services at the top
of the file like I've done here and this
is where we're gonna write our launch
video camera method let's look back at
the Objective C launch camera method and
see what we need to include here okay I
think I'm just gonna make a list of what
this method is doing create image picker
set the properties of the image picker
what properties are we setting source
type media types allows editing and then
set the delegate and then present the
controller I think that's pretty much
all this method does cool now we'll copy
these notes over to the Swift project so
we can fill in that method let's see
what should we call it a record video
controller set the source type which is
of course camera media types is a little
bit tricky because it has to be an array
and it also has to be a string for now
we're gonna set allows editing to false
but we're gonna change that later let me
set the delegate to self and we're
almost ready present uh-oh what's going
on there can I assign value of type
uiviewcontroller to oh we need to
conform to the protocol of course and
also the navigation controller delegate
okay cool so that error went away and
then we present it probably don't really
need these comments now that ought to do
it for presenting the camera and now we
also need to write the methods to
retrieve the video that we record
remember there are two methods that we
need to implement that are part of the
image picker controller delegate
protocol did finish picking media with
info and image picker controller did
cancel so let's look back again at the
objective-c version and see how these
methods are implemented there here we
are in the Objective C project and were
at the pragma mark for image
your controller delegate methods if we
look here in the method did finish
picking media with info we can see that
first we needed to check the media type
then if the media type is a movie we
need to save this raw video URL and then
here the comments say get start and end
points for a trimmed video well we're
not trimming the video yet so we can
skip that part and then here it's got a
call to crop video to square
we're not cropping the video yet either
I'll tell you what for now we'll just
save this video to the photos album that
way we'll know the recording
functionality is working so we're back
in the Swift version of our
uiviewcontroller extension and to make
this file a little more readable i went
ahead and moved to the image picker
controller delegate methods into an
additional extension here in the method
did finish picking media with info is
where we want to save our video to the
photo album so we'll call the method UI
save video at path to saved photos album
and we'll remember to dismiss this view
controller the image picker controller
oops this has to be a path
and if we scroll up to our launch video
camera method you can see that it's been
connected to storyboard it's connected
to the record button so our launch video
camera method is ready our image picker
controller delegate methods are ready so
let's run it and see how it looks okay
now keep in mind that when I show you
these representations of the phone on
the screen I'm actually showing you a
movie that I recorded of me running the
app on my phone because of course you're
gonna need to be running the app on
device if you're testing anything
involving the camera you won't be able
to use the simulator here you can see I
can launch the camera I took a video of
my teammate the camera's dismissed and
here you can see that when I go out of
the app and then I go into my photo
library my videos there fantastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
