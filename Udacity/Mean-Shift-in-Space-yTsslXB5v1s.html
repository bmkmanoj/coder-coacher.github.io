algorithm to find the modes within that
distribution by the way the slides I'm
going to show you I've showed you before
and again these are all over the
Internet
it says originally from Ukraine it's and
sorrel and if that's who did it and I
thank you for doing these animations
because everybody uses them so the idea
of mean shift is the following here I
have a distribution of points in some
feature space I plopped down some region
of interest and that region is drawn
here as a circle but think of it as a
Gaussian blob right so it actually is
more weighted in the middle than it is
to the outside mean shift tends to work
a little bit better if you have a center
weighting the reason for that is if I've
got a hard circle on the end and if I
move it a little bit I might run into a
bunch of new points and I'll change my
value quickly and I'd like the things to
always be smooth when I move things
around so by having a fall-off in the
Gaussian as I get there as I get there
those points have a little bit of
influence and then they gain more
influence so what happens is I put down
this region of interest i compute the
center of mass that's the weighted
center of mass and this difference
between them that's called my mean shift
vector and I just shift my mean there's
not a beautiful animation and what do I
do I do it again I compute the weighted
center of mass there it is new mean
shift vector shift it you know marvelous
and what do I do I do it one more time
and I keep doing this until I've
converged and there are some interesting
proofs of convergence under some
reasonable assumptions and that finds
you this mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
