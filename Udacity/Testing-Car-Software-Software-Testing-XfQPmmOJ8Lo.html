I'm gonna describe a kind of testing
that somebody's doing and you're gonna
tell me which are the kinds of testing
that we've discussed that is most its
most like so we have a piece of software
under test and this is some sort of a
really critical embedded system maybe it
for example is controlling airbags on a
vehicle and this vehicle is going to be
out in the field for many years and so
cars get subjected to fairly extremely
to fairly extreme conditions they have a
lot of heating and cooling cycles they
get exposed to salt and mud and water
and so cars it cars are fairly harsh
environment and one of the things we're
going to want to know is how the
software responds to defects that get
introduced into these into the
automobiles wiring as this vehicle ages
in the field that is to say as people
are driving it around the salty roads in
Michigan or whatever and so what we're
gonna do is using maybe a simulator or
something we're gonna make it look like
a wire that's used for this processor
that's used for software running on this
processor to talk with other modules so
cars are really big distributed system
so the software into test here is just
one of many pieces of software running
on the car we're gonna use a some sort
of a simulation module to simulate a
noisy wire and that basically means for
example a wire whose insulation has
rubbed off and that is not perfectly
conducting signals anymore it's getting
it's getting junk injected into it
because it's banging against the cars
frame or something so the question is
what kind of testing are we doing and
your choices are regression testing unit
testing stress testing or white box
testing so please right now click the
box that best describes what we're doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
