randomization of that ID the resolver
can randomize the source port on which
it sends the query thereby adding an
additional 16 bits of entropy to the ID
that's associated with the query
unfortunately picking a random source
port can be resource intensive and also
a network address translator or a NAT
could D randomize the port another
defense is called the 0 X 20 or 0x20
encoding which is based on the intuition
that DNS matching and resolution is
entirely case insensitive so
capitalization of individual letters in
the domain name do not affect the answer
that the resolver will return this 0x20
bit or the bit that affects whether a
particular character is capitalized or
in lowercase can also be used to
introduce additional entropy when
generating a response to a query such as
this one the query is copied from the
DNS query into the response exactly as
it was in the query the mixed pattern of
upper and lowercase letters thus
constitutes a channel if the resolver
and the authoritative server can agree
on a shared key then the resolver and
the authoritative are the only ones who
know the appropriate pattern of upper
and lowercase letters for a particular
domain name because no attacker would
know the appropriate combination of
upper and lowercase letters for a
particular domain it becomes even more
difficult for the attacker to inject a
bogus reply because not only would the
attacker have to guess the ID but the
attacker would also have to guess the
capitalization sequence for any
particular domain name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
