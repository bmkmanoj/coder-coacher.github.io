think the next task is to implement
logging out and also like to implement
what happens when the user gets kicked
off so when could a user be kicked off
well usually when a user logs in they
don't stay logged in forever and ever
and ever and you can actually control
how long firebase will allow you to have
a logged-in user via the dashboards
session length property right here just
get to it by clicking on the log in an
auth tab selecting a value here affects
all forms of logon I'm going to go ahead
and set this to one month now being
kicked off is an automatic thing whereas
logging out is something that you choose
to do but both of these two actions
should have the same effect and that is
to clear the user data out of shared
preferences and to take you back to the
login activity both of these actions
will also trigger an off state listener
so we can take the code that does this
and put it inside of it all state
listener and then we'll be set in both
scenarios now being kicked out because
of session timeout is something that
firebase handles for you but you're
going to need to hook up the login
button to have the correct behavior to
log out a user you simply need to get a
firebase reference and call on off on it
that'll log out whatever user is logged
in on the client I've already written a
log out menu option for you you just
need to make it visible and I'll send
over more details about that in the spec
hopefully that's enough to get you
started and good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
