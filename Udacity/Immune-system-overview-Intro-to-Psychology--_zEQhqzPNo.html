of our immune system to help us
understand exactly what's happening in
our bodies and our ability to fight off
illnesses there are two types of defense
we have as humans we have natural
immunity and we have acquired immunity
natural immunity refers to the processes
that we have to remove foreign
substances from our bodies inflammation
in phagocytosis are two forms of natural
immunity inflammation occurs when
tissues are restored following some type
of injury whereas phagocytosis occurs
when white blood cells take in a
substance and digest it or move it to a
place where it can be destroyed so these
are two types of natural immunities and
we have acquired immunities when we get
antibodies that are produced in the body
in response to specific antigens we get
these through experience for example
when you become sick from a virus you
develop antibodies that defend against
that virus and that's why specific
viruses cannot affect you again in the
future this is an example of an acquired
immunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
