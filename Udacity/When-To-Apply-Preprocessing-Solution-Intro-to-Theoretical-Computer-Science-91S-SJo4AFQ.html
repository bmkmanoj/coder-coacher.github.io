obvious before you even start a search
tree algorithm you should always apply
pre-processing and the last one of
course also doesn't make sense because
once the search tree is completed then
you already have your best possible
solution so why would you want to start
pre-processing again the interesting
part is this year because it could be
the case that the assignments that you
create during your search tree algorithm
actually allow you to do new
pre-processing rules and you have also
already seen this for example for
independent set and vertex cover where
we have said that during the search tree
you come across cases where for other
vertices you can already decide if they
are going to be in an optimal solution
or not so it does make sense and there
the name is a bit misleading to apply
this pre-processing also during the
search tree now the question is how
often and when you should apply it you
should definitely apply it regularly
because you can regularly gain new
information during your search tree
algorithm doing it at each level on the
other hand I think should not be
recommended and the reason for that is
although pre-processing requires only
polynomial time it still requires time
so if you do the pre-processing too
often then on the one hand you waste a
lot of time and on the other hand these
rules will not be very effective because
you need to have made a few more
decisions each time in the search tree
until new pre-processing rules might
become applicable how often to apply it
is more is almost more of an art than a
science but you should definitely not
think about pre-processing as something
that you do only before you start a
search tree algorithm but also something
that can help you during a search tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
