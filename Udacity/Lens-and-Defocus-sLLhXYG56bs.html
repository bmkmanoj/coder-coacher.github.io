rethink some of the ideas we've had
about lenses and defocus things let me
review some of that just to kind of get
it started because then we're actually
going to look at how we're going to
change these things course remember that
basically what we have and we have a
lens like this we have an aperture the
opening right the opening is the amount
of the area that actually goes through
the aperture and then hits the sensor
after the shutter is open shutter is the
one that controls the amount of time the
aperture the amount of light that enters
now if you recall some of the simple
optics stuff we looked at this before
there's also always a sensor there's a
lens and the light of course from the
focal plane goes through and if you put
the object on the focal plane what
basically happens is the image is formed
on the camera sensor and that's exactly
we get a focused image and of course the
image of the point light source if there
was a point light source at this point
here where the object is we would
basically get something like this and of
course the point spread function would
just be a sharp line like this so of
course this is inverted the white bright
one basically shows this is my point
spread function here for this region
this is the optics we have looked at
many a times in this class now let's
actually start thinking about what D
focus does in context of this simple
lens system which basically means now is
I'm going to move the object at a
different distance so the same light
source from here would now basically
mean that the actual convergence of this
light is happening a little bit ahead
this is where my camera sensor so of
course it's now getting to be a little
bit forming a little bit before this
location and of course there's not
divergence showing up which then results
in a point spread function that's much
thicker and of course that translates
into the image of the defocused point
light source would look something like
this much wider as shown here let's move
the object further back of course when
we do this you can notice that the point
spread function gets wider and of course
we also know that would mean that the
image of the D focus point light source
would look bigger just to kind of
continue this exercise we will actually
now do last one
basically remove this further away and
you know this is even white and of
course bigger blob is showing up here
and it's a defocused point light source
which was put here so we know about this
kind of stuff and that gives us a little
bit of an idea of how all of this works
something we've looked at before another
further example of this is it gets
bigger and here now I'm showing you the
last stage where I've moved the object
further and of course the point spread
function is really wide and the D focus
point light source is also much larger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
