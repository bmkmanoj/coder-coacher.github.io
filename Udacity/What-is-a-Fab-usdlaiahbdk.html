using a floating action button or FA be
fab this is a vibrant colored circular
icon button that floats above the rest
of your content in your app and it's a
way of promoting a prominent action and
of communicating the character of a
screen as this button floats in front of
other content it's always easily
accessible and communicates its
importance while it floats above content
and generally has the highest elevation
of all views it can still respond to
changes in other parts of your UI for
example scrolling with the content or
repositioning fabs have standard sizes
and elevations that they are
recognizable across applications they
come in either 40 or 50 6 DP diameters
and generally have a resting elevation
of 60 P rising to 12 DP when pressed
well they can be positioned wherever
makes sense for your interface they tend
to sit well on seams and steps where two
surfaces meet or anchored to an
appropriate corner just as the fab is a
great way to direct attention you should
be careful not to overuse it everywhere
in your app and only use a single fat
per screen not every screen needs a fab
but if there is one clear action on the
screen then it's a great way to promote
it if you're struggling to identify
which action should be a fab then it's a
good sign that you probably don't need
one on that screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
