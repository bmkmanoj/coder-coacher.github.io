this particular example so here's a
translation of that problem and the
solution into Python so first I have a
list of the connections in that graph
that we're just looking at no it's a
through H and for each of these pairs I
go through and make a link in a graph G
and then I run a piece of code to list
the component sizes for that graph G and
here's what the output looks like and
then we'll go back and look at what the
algorithm is it goes through and
identify that there's two components one
we'll just name little a because it
contains node little a it's for nodes in
it and then there's a separate component
that's not connected to the first one
that contains B and that also has four
nodes and in fact looking back at the
graph here that's exactly what we see
there's the purple nodes which include
node a and then there's these blue green
nodes four of which are visible here
that include B so it finds the right
stuff so how does it go about doing this
well it essentially uses the same
algorithm that I did when I was doing it
by hand but of course it doesn't encode
the main routine that we call is called
mark component so that's kind of like
what I was doing when I was turning
nodes purple and it works like this we
give it the graph that we're working on
the current node that were that we're
marking and data structure that keeps
track of which things have been marked
so far call this routine on this node
and so that's a new node we haven't seen
any before so we mark it so that means
we visited that node and we say that in
this particular call to the routine so
far we've marked exactly one node then
we look at all the neighbors of that
node and for each of them we say well if
that neighbor of the node that we're
looking at hasn't been marked so far
then what we're going to do is
recursively call mark a component on
that neighbor it's going to go and get
everywhere that it can get to that it
hasn't already gotten to mark them all
and return and what it returns is the
number of nodes that it marked as part
of this process and however many nodes
it marked we're going to add that to the
total marked so we marked our current
node then we visited a neighbor and
marked all the nodes connected to that
neighbor then we come back and repeat
this loop
all the different neighbors of the node
where we started and that's exhausted it
means we've now reached out and touched
all the nodes that are touchable from
from a node node and so we return the
total that were actually marked as part
of this process and then it's done
so that's them that's the main routine
that does all the hard work there's also
routine on the outside that takes the
graph and starts off saying well
nothing's been marked so far we do have
an empty data structure then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna loop through all
the nodes in the graph because we don't
know which ones are going to be the
beginnings of a new component or not for
each one that we visit we say well if
that node hasn't been marked in some
previous iteration then we've got a new
component and this node that we're just
visiting is a part of that component so
we say hey we've got a component
containing node node and that what we do
is we recursively go and mark all the
things connected to that node count up
how many things got got marked in that
way and then we return so that we know
is there was a component contain node
node and it has a certain count to it
when it's done that it moves on to the
next node a bunch of these have probably
already been marked so they just get
skipped really quickly but eventually it
maybe reaches a node that hasn't been
marked because it wasn't connected to
anything so far prints that one out and
continues so this really is very
explicitly what we were doing by hand
just one piece at a time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
