negative 1 comma 3 it would have an a
value of one and it would have a B value
of 5 nice work if you got these three
correct we can find this center by
looking at the x squared term and the y
squared term the X has a plus one next
to it so that means the x coordinate of
the center will be negative 1 and the y
value has a negative 3 or subtraction of
three next to it so this means that the
y coordinate of the center is positive 3
always keep in mind that the values of H
and K for our Center are the opposite of
these two signs this will always be true
for circles and ellipses so now do we
need to find the values of a and B so
what we should do is take our equation
and divide through by a hundred that
will set our equation equal to one so
here's my original equation and now
we're going to divide each term by a
hundred 100 / 100 equals 1 so this will
simplify and then we have 4 divided by
100 well 4 / 4 equals 1 and 4 divided it
into 100 equals 25 so we'll have one in
our numerator with the y minus 3 squared
divided by 25 in the denominator I don't
write the one here because it's just
multiplication 1 times any expression is
itself and then finally on the right
hand side we'll just have one now we
want this equation to look like this one
but notice I don't have an a squared
term I don't exactly have a fraction
here but really I do remember we can
divide any expression x 1 / 1 will give
us the same exact expression so now it
can rewrite these two denominators with
1 squared equaling 1 and 5 squared
equaling 25 this is how we get the
values of a and B and thinking back to
our Center the value of H really needs
to be negative 1 in order for the
equation have positive 1 and the value
of K would need to be three since we'll
have 3 here so we can see that our
center is at negative 1 comma 3 then we
move one unit left and right to get two
points on our lips and we move 5 units
up and down to get two more points on
the ellipse highlighting these points we
can see that these two are 5 units above
and below our center and that this point
is one unit to the right of our center
now des most isn't showing this point
but that's just because it only shows us
certain points of interest now there are
reason why it's only showing us these
points of interest and when you learn
more about ellipses you'll discover why
these points are so important for this
one it happens to be a y-intercept and
in fact des most will also tell us the
x-intercepts these other two points are
really important and perhaps you can do
some research to figure out why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
