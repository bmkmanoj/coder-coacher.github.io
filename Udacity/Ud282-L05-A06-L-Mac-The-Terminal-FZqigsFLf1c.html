the Java development kit we can start
writing Java programs you can write Java
code in any simple text editor which
we'll see in a bit then to run these
programs you'll need to use a terminal
window which looks like this the
terminal is an application that lets you
give your computer commands it's also
sometimes called a command line prompt
or shell I'm going to close this window
and show you how to find it and open up
the terminal on your own computer the
terminal can be found by going to your
Applications folder then navigating to
your utilities folder and it's in here
this application name terminal and you
can click on it to open it you can also
do a simple spotlight search of the word
terminal and click on the correct
application when it pops up and once
you've opened the terminal it should
look like this you can see the time that
you last logged in and a username here
which for my computer is Udacity and
then I can start typing commands for my
first command I'm just going to ask my
computer what version of Java it has
installed this way I can make sure that
I've installed the correct version to
check what version of Java is installed
I just type Java a space then dash
version and you should see something
like this it shows me my version of Java
which is a version of Java 8 and as of
the time of this recording may 19 2016
this is the latest version it tells me I
have this runtime environment and also
this Java VM and vm stands for virtual
machine so this looks good and if you
don't see this or see something like a
java version not found message then go
back to the instructions for installing
the java development kit and try and
stalling again or troubleshooting from
there we'll need to have the Java
development kit installed before we move
forward and write our own programs so
make sure you complete this step before
you continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
