show your understanding of this forwards
and backwards I've got a relatively
simple grammar up here in the upper left
but it's a grammar that couldn't be
captured by any regular expression so it
can't be that bad P goes to open p
closed or P goes to nothing you could
imagine drawing the epsilon there and
our input is the four character string
open open closed closed I said before
that we'd need to annotate each of our
parsing States and I have eight of them
shown here with information about which
state they came from what the from
position was what the starting position
was so what I'd like you to do is fill
in each one of these blanks with a
single number corresponding to the chart
position that this state conceptually
starts that another way to think about
that is let's say that we're in a
particular state like this one P goes to
dot open p clothes how many tokens must
there have been beforehand for this to
possibly make sense we know we're in
chart position one but here it looks as
if there's nothing in our past how many
hidden things would there have to be in
our past for this to work out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
