the total amount of money that grant is
going to make from people who bought his
products the first day and the second
day it would be great if we could
simplify it further however we don't
know how to do that yet so before we
dive into this particular example let's
look at a slightly less complicated but
similar problem let's say we just have
some expression i picked 3x minus 5y
plus 6x plus 9y now how could we
simplify this expression well I think we
need to remember what each of these
terms really means so 3x for example is
actually equal to x plus x plus x + 6 X
is actually equal to 6x is added
together right now writing this out
might not seem particularly helpful but
I think the reason that I chose to write
these terms this way will become clear
if we just rearrange the order of the
terms in this expression so now we
switch the order of the terms around set
the terms with X are next to each other
and the terms of Y are next to each
other now we can see that the first
thing you want to do is add 3x + 6 X
together with all the X is written out
that doesn't seem that hard I just need
to figure out how many x is total I have
down here and if i count them I have 1 2
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 x's so I guess that
means that 3x plus 6x equals 9x now one
thing we can notice is that in order to
get the sum of 3x + 6 X here we don't
actually have to count all the x's all
we really have to do is add the
coefficients of the variables together
since 3 plus 6 equals 9 once we have the
coefficient we just make sure that we
multiply that by the variable that both
of these terms have we usually call this
adding like terms or combining like
terms as I've written at the top of the
slide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
