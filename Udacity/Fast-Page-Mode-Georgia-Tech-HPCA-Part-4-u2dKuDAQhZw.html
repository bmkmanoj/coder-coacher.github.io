slow because really we have to use the
row decoder to select a row then get
those bits onto the bed lines then sense
what's on the bed lines and so on and
only then we get the values in the row
buffer from which we can read them and
send them back to the processor but not
all of the DRAM accesses have to be that
slow so we will discuss a technique
called fast page mode that makes some of
the dynamics is a lot faster than others
I remember our organization of the DRAM
with some part of the address to select
a row that row of bits gets output to
the sense amplifier we then latch those
into the row buffer and then from the
row buffer we use the column address to
select a bit to output and then from the
row buffer the column decoder using the
column address selects the actual bit to
output note that once we have done all
of this the row buffer can retain the
entire row so if we want to read a bit
from the same row we don't need to go
through the whole row address sense
amplifier row buffer mechanism again
what we can do is simply keep what we
have in the row buffer and just change
the column address then the bit simply
gets read out of the row buffer without
a new theorem access so this approach of
finding what we need in the row buffer
is called fast page mode it's not called
fast row mode just because some people
prefer to call some people prefer to
call a memory row a page it usually has
thousands of bits so people call it a
page it has nothing to do with the pages
that we use for virtual memory it's just
a name for something that has a lot of
bits in this case so fast page mode
works this way we do what is called
opening a page that's um that amounts to
providing a row address selecting a row
sense amplification of what the cells
output and latching what we get into the
row buffer
now we can do a series of reads and
writes to the page which really happens
to the row buffer we can read or we can
modify bits in the row buffer finally
when we want to do something on another
row in memory we do what is called
closing the page we now use the sense
amplifiers to write back to the row what
we have in a row buffer it could be
different data than what we read because
we have been modifying it also in
between and this way if we want to do a
single read we would have to open a page
do one read then close the page to write
back things to our memory cells because
of the destructive read and then finally
we have to do what is called closing the
page which amounts to writing the data
from the row buffer back into the row
from which we read it so if we want to
do a single memory read we would open a
page the data is now in the row buffer
and no longer in the row do the read
from the row buffer and then close the
page which causes the data to be sent
back and written back to the row we can
do a single write which amounts to
opening a page the data lines up in the
row buffer we do a single write so we
modify a bit in the row buffer and then
we close the page which causes the row
to get the new data and some of the bits
may not have changed which is why we had
to read in the first place but we can do
a lot more than just one operation in
between opening and closing a page so
usually it's advantageous to open a page
do all the reads and writes that we can
to that page before we close the page
and open another page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
