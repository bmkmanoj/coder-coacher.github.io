farther into the four loops that
implement these functions wind bits were
the same so if every bit was
independently different than the pasta
the probability of executing farther
into these functions dropped off
exponentially and so with 64 bits the
probability dropped off too fast for us
to ever execute the case where a and B
were the same so based on that knowledge
based on some domain-specific knowledge
we made a new random tester by flipping
a random number of bits did a much more
even exploration of the iteration spaces
of those loops including reaching the
ending state which as we saw in that GCC
documentation was the state that we
actually wanted to test and so this has
been a pretty elaborate exercise for
what in the end is our to pretty simple
functions and what this just shows is
that you can do okay with a really
simple random tester and not
understanding what's going on but if you
want to do a better job we really need
to think about what it is that we're
testing how the code is structured and
how we're going to execute all the way
through it and that's just and this is
just sort of a fundamental limitation of
random testing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
