putting our new knowledge of while loops
functions string slicing and if-else
statements to the test at the end of
this work session you'll be asked to
write code for a function called process
Madlib which takes in a string Madlib
and returns a new string processed for
all instances of noun and verb are
replaced with random nouns and verbs
this might seem like a pretty daunting
task and it's totally normal to have
that feeling of where do I even begin
but the most important thing to do
before we start writing any code is to
make a plan to solve this problem now
there are many ways that we can write
this function and I encourage you to try
and implement your own way but I'll show
you the way that I approach this problem
how about we start with an example let's
say that this string sentence was passed
into our process MATLAB function let's
remember the goal of our final function
we're supposed to return a new string
processed where each instance of noun or
verb is replaced with a random noun a
verb so let's write our currently empty
string processed right underneath now
the most intuitive approach for me was
to look at each word in the string
passed in check if the word is equal to
noun or verb and if it is we'll add a
random noun or verb to the string
processed if not well add the word we're
looking at to processed instead although
this way of building a mad libs
generator seems straightforward things
can change quite a bit once you start
coding for example when I try putting
these steps into Python it wasn't so
easy to do my code start to become
pretty messy and as I found messy code
means buggy code something that I wish
I'd learned when I first started
programming was that if the solution
you're working on just doesn't seem to
be working or if it's getting too
complicated then it can be a good idea
to try a different approach it's alright
to say alright this didn't work out too
well how about we try something
different so that's what I did I step
back thought for a bit played a game
ping bar to talked about ways to solve
this problem with some friends and soon
afterwards I thought of another solution
to this problem that I was excited to
try out here's my new approach to the
problem instead of going through the
string passed in word by word we go
through it character by character now
imagine if we have a box that's 4
characters long
now let's say we place it on top of the
string passed in so in this case
sentence we then check if whatever is
inside this box
is equal to noun a verb and if it is we
had a random noun or verb to a process
string and move the box over by four
characters if whatever is inside isn't
equal to noun or verb we'll just simply
add the first character to our string
process and move the box over by one
character so in this example everything
the box is equal to a single space M so
we ask the question is the contents of
this box equal to now or verb it's not
so add the first character which in this
case is I to our process string and move
the box over by one now the box is equal
to single space m and single space so we
asked the same question is the box equal
to noun or verb it's not so we will just
have the first character which is the
single space character to a string
process and move the box over by one now
the box is equal to M single space a so
we ask the same question
it's the Box equals to noun or verb it's
not so we'll add the first character
which in this case is a two hour process
string and move the box over by one
let's say we continue this process and
we're almost at the end of our string
and our box is now equal to space nou we
asked the same question is a box equal
to 9 or verb
well almost but not quite so we'll have
the first character of our box which is
a single space to our process string and
move the box over by one character ah
now our box is equal to noun so we had a
random down to our process string and we
move our box over by four and now our
box is at the end of the sentence so we
have nothing else to do after testing
the box idea on a few other strings with
success I figured that this is a solid
approach to building a madlibs generator
since the solution was straightforward
it transferred over to code pretty well
now that we have a good visual idea of
how the final function is supposed to
work it's your job to put this in code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
