based on the hypothesis that factoring a
very large number is very very hard when
we say a very large number we mean an
integer that is at least 500 tough bit
but often in the range of 1024 bits to
4096 bits that is even such a large
integer it's going to take a long time
to factor it into two primes on the
other hand if someone finds a very
efficient way to factor a large number
into primes then the security of RSA can
be broken here's why the public key is
given so we know n m in OE if we can
efficiently factor n into P times Q
where P and Q are two primes then we can
compute total n as P minus 1 times Q
minus 1 and if we can compute total n
knowing the publicly E we can then find
its multiplicative inverse Majin N and
this inverse is the private key D
therefore if we can efficiently factor a
large integer into two primes that would
mean that from the public key we can
derive the private key and that will
break the security of RSA because if you
know the private key then you can
decrypt confidential messages or you can
also forge digital signatures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
