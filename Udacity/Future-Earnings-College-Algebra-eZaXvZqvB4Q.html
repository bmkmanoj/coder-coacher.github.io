little bit just so I'd have room to
write my answer out but this is all the
information that you had to start the
last quiz with remember from our
practice using substitution before that
if we see a variable in one equation but
we know that that variable is equal to
some other expression that we can
substitute in that alternate expression
in the place of the original variable so
in the case of W and n for example we
have these two numbers that we can now
replace them with so we see W here 402 w
and w here w equals 30 so i can take the
30 and move it into this slot and i
could do the same thing with n and 12
i'm going to rewrite the side of the
equation again but this time with our
new numbers plugged in in place of W I
put 30 in a place of n I put 12 now we
need to recall our understanding of
order of operations so PEMDAS the thing
you need to decide here is whether we
multiply or we add first since we have
two terms that are multiplied and
another two terms that are multiplied
but then also an addition sign in our
past practice the simplifying
expressions we always simplified with in
each term or multiplied everything out
before we combine like terms or added
and that's completely in line with
PEMDAS remember this is an acronym to
help you remember the order in which you
do different mathematical operations
within a given expression so the M here
which stands for multiplication comes
before the a which stands for addition
so we're going to do our multiplication
first 402 times 30 is 12,000 60 + 480 x
12 is 5716 last but not least we add
these two numbers together this gives us
a final answer of 17,000 820 much to the
light of grant and his venture capital
fund errs they are going to bring in
seventeen thousand eight hundred twenty
dollars with just the orders that were
replaced so far in the first few weeks
that is really incredible grant has
proven that he has a product or actually
two products that are popular and people
think are really going to be useful he
is convinced he's out to change the
world or at least the way that glasses
wearers see the world congratulations on
great work we covered a ton of material
and I'm sure that you did great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
