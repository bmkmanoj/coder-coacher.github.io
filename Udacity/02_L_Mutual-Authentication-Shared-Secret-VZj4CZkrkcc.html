that is Alice needs to prove to Bob that
she's really Alice and vice-versa
meaning that Bob needs to prove to Alice
that he's Bob suppose that Alice and Bob
shared secret key kab that is only Bob
and Alice know this key kab he is an
authentication protocol using symmetric
cryptography first Alice says to Bob hey
I'm Alice
second Bob said to Alice Lily
prove it and he sends a random value r1
which recorded a challenge third Alice
then encrypts r1 using the shared key
kab and sends Bob the ciphertext which
recorded the response to the challenge
when Bob receives the response he
decrypts it and see if it matches the
plaintext r1 that his assent to Alice if
it matches then he knows that the party
that he's communicating with must be
Alice because other than himself only
Alice knows the shear key kab and
without ka b r1 cannot be encrypted
properly that is the ciphertext that he
receives won't be decrypted properly to
our 1/4 now it is Alice's turn to
authenticate Bob so similarly she sends
Bob a random challenge or to filth Bob
encrypt r2 with the Cherokee kab and
sends a ciphertext to Alice upon
receiving the response from Bob Alice
decrypts the ciphertext and if the
result matches the plaintext r2 that she
just sent to Bob then she knows that the
party that she's communicating with must
be Bob
note that if only one-way authentication
is required for example Alice is a
client and needs to authenticate to Bob
which is a server but Bob does not need
to authenticate to Alice then only the
first three steps are necessary and if
Alice is a human user then typically the
key kab can be derived from a password
hash which is known to Bob read
discussed how challenge and response are
used in authentication it is very
important for the challenges say r1 and
r2 to be not easily repeatable or
predictable otherwise an intruder such
as Trudy can be caught the challenge and
response between Alice and Bob and we
play them to impersonate Alice or Bob
for example an intruder called Trudy
wants to impersonate either Alice or Bob
suppose truly has spent time decoding
the authentication messages between
Alice and Bob across multiple sessions
now if when Trudy tries to impersonate
Alice and Bob happens to send our one a
challenge that has been used previously
and recorded by Trudy then Trudy can
just simply send a response that she had
recorded from Alice that is truly is
able to send the ciphertext of r1 to Bob
and Bob will be tricked to believe that
she is Alice as another example suppose
the challenges always increase in values
then Trudy can first impersonate Bob and
send a large challenge say r1 equal to
1000 and we call the response from Alice
meanwhile the real Bob is using a
smaller r1 say r1 equal to 950 then
Trudy can impersonate Alice sometime in
the future when the real Bob finally
sends r1 equal to 1000 to recap first of
all the messages step is sent over the
Internet can be captured by intruder
Trudy and our job is to prevent these
messages being replayed so that Trudy
can impersonate Alice and Bob and in
order to do that the random challenges
r1 and r2 should really be not easily
repeatable or predictable again the most
important precaution of using this
authentication protocol is that r1 and
r2 should not be easily repeatable or
predictable otherwise and intruders such
as Trudy can impersonate Alice and Bob
by simply doing
recalled and replay therefore all 1 and
r2
should be large random values another
security precaution is that the sheer
secret key kab needs to be protected
because if Trudy can steal a copy of the
key let's say from one of the
communication endpoints either on Alice
or Bob then she can impersonate either
Alice or Bob in other words the security
of the endpoints is as important as the
security of the link between the two
endpoints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
