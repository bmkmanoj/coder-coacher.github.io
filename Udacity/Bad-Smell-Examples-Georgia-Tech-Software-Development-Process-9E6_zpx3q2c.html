this melt called duplicated code so what
happens here that what the symptom is
that smell is is that you have the same
a piece of code the same fragment of
code or code structure replicated in
more than one place and that's pretty
common when we do for example copy and
paste programming something that we
mentioned at the beginning of the lesson
so for example we are just instead of
our implementing a piece of
functionality and we know we already
have we simply copy from a different
part of the code so what do you do if
you have duplicated code this can be a
problem over time because you might end
up with a lot of duplication in your
system you can use the extract method
refactoring that we just saw and
basically create a method that has got
exactly the same functionality of this
fragment of code and then replace the
fragment of code with an invocation to
that method and you will do it in all
the places where the code is duplicated
that simplifies the code and also favors
reuse because there might be more places
that can benefit from that additional
method especially if it implements some
popular piece of functionality another
example of best mail a typical one is a
log method so you have a very long metal
with a lot of statements and we know
that the longer procedure the more
difficult it is to understand it and
maintain it so one might want to do in
these cases is to use a refactoring such
as an extract method or decompose
condition to make the code simpler
shorten it and extract some of the
functionality into other methods so
basically break down the method in
smaller methods that are more cohesive
another typical example of decimal which
is something that can happen very
commonly during maintenance is that you
keep adding functionality to a class and
you end up with a large class so a class
that is clearly too big it contains too
many fields too many methods and it's
just too complex to understand this case
the obvious solution is to use the
extract class or subclass and basically
break down the class in multiple classes
each one with a more cohesive piece of
functionality so the classes are more
cohesive and more understandable and the
overall structure of the system is
improved shotgun surgery is an
interesting smell and the case here is
that we're in a situation and it
probably happened to you me definitely
happen to me in which every time you
make some kind of change to the system
you have to make many little changes
sort of all over the place to many
different classes and this can be a
symptom of the fact that the
functionality is spread among these
different classes so there's too much
coupling between the classes and too
little
vision within the classes also in this
case you can use refactoring for example
by using the move method or move field
or inline class to basically bring the
pieces of related functionality together
so that your resulting classes are more
cohesive you reduce the dependencies
between the different classes and you
address this problem because at this
point each class is much more
self-contained and therefore it can be
modified by itself without having to
affect the rest of the system
the last is Mel I wanna mention is one I
really like is the feature MV and it
refers to a method that seems more
interested in a class other than the one
it belongs to so for example this method
is using a lot of public fields of
another class is calling a lot of
methods of the other class and so in
this case the solution is really clear
what you want to do is to perform the
extract method refactoring and then the
move method refactoring so as to take
the jell-o's method out of the class
where it doesn't belong and get it home
to the class where it really belongs and
once more the effect of this is that you
decrease the coupling between the two
classes and therefore you have a better
system and also you eliminate the envy
which is always a good thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
