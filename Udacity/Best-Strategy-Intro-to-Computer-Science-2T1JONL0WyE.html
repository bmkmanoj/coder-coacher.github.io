carefully about a strategy that will be
the most effective way to finish the
problem we've got a lot of different
things we might do next we don't
necessarily need to do all of these and
the order in which we do them will make
a big difference in how efficiently and
correctly we solve the problem so I want
you to think about this and give an
answer that lists the steps you would do
an order and an example to show you the
format for the answer is just to put the
letters in order this is not a correct
answer but note that you can include
some of the steps more than once and you
don't need to include all of the steps
this is pretty tricky and I don't expect
you to match exactly what I think the
best answer is but there's several
different ways to answer this that would
be accepted and you should be able to
come up with one of those so see if you
can order these steps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
