viewport we have its height as a percept
and we have its contents as a percept
for the scrollbar we have the position
of the handle is a percept and also the
sizes of percept
but we don't currently have any percepts
for the file manager and in fact the
user doesn't directly see the file
manager however if we took our 40,000
foot view of the system and we said what
is external to the system and what is
internal to the system that user is
external to the system the users is is
the one that's gonna be taking advantage
of the the system but also the file
system itself the operating system is
external to the system and the operating
system is the one with which the file
manager component has to deal so we're
going to treat the operating system as
an external actor and the file manager
is going to interact with that external
actor and as far as the file manager is
concerned it has an attribute which is
the document providing that as as a
resource to the rest of the system and
it's it's its it also has an interface
to this external actor that is the actor
has to provide that in that document so
we have an attribute there which is the
document which is a sequence of sequence
of lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
