recreation of the Solomon Asch study a
really famous social psychology study on
conformity what they did was they showed
their participants a standard line and
then had them compare it to three other
lines kinda like the one I showed you
they have them do this about eighteen
times now this was a relatively easy
task when the independent variable
wasn't manipulated people messed up less
than one person of the time however when
the independent variable was manipulated
people messed up about thirty seven
percent of the time so what was he
independent variable well it was the
people that were in the room saying
their responses allowed out of all of
the people in the room there was only
one real participant the rest of the
people were Confederates meaning they
worked for the research team but they
appeared to be real participants after a
while of answering these questions
the researchers had the Confederates
incorrectly answer the question on
purpose because they wanted to see if
hearing these five or six other people
answer the question incorrectly would
actually sway the participants response
and well as it turns out it did let's go
to Susan for some more details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
