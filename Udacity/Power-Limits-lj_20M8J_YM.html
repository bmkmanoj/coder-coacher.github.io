constraints on computing platforms is
power you may be familiar with this fact
if you've taken say a computer
architecture class even so let me give
you my take on the basic problem here
perhaps by way of review for some of you
this is a well-known chart created in
2001 by Pat Gelsinger then at Intel the
chart tracked power per unit area or
power density across several generations
of Intel's micro processors it tracked
these up until about two thousand one
the time of the talk and then
extrapolated into the future so what is
power power measures the rate of energy
burned or consumed per unit time power
is usually measured in units of say
joules per second or watts now as it
happens the way people used to make
sequential computers run faster up until
the early aughts was to increase the
clock rate but as you'll see momentarily
when you do that Dell singers prediction
was that the amount of power per unit
area would skyrocket almost literally
and we know today how the story ended
basically in the early aughts people
stopped increasing the clock rate and
when multi-core let's see why let's look
more closely at the power consumed by a
computer program this chart comes from
real data that one of my former graduate
students collected that student was g
choi shown here doing what I gather is
actual science the chart shows measured
power taken at a bunch of samples while
the application is running you can see
that there's some fluctuation presumably
the power behavior of the application is
changing as it's doing different things
by a computing system at some point in
time has two parts I will call the first
part constant power constant power is
basically some baseline amount of power
that the application or the computing
system consumes independent of what it's
doing now you may have heard the term
static power and idle power being
bandied about in your daily life because
you know I mean who doesn't walk into a
grocery store or yoga studio and hear
people always talking about static power
this or idle power that very roughly
speaking constant power is a general
term that I'll use to encompass things
like static and idle power and if you
don't know what I'm talking about just
remember constant power is baseline
power now suppose a computation runs
depending on what parts of the system
it's using the power above and beyond
constant power will fluctuate let's call
those fluctuations dynamic power view
well maybe not that dynamic now real
life circuits can be much more complex
than this simple model suggests but
let's not worry about that instead let's
take a cue from the famous statistician
