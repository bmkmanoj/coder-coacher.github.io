are there in exokernel for implementing
these secure bindings there are three
methods the first method is hardware
mechanisms and I gave you this example
of a TLB entry other examples of
hardware mechanisms include getting a
physical page frame from exokernel or a
portion of the frame buffer that is
being used by the display these are all
examples of specific Hardware resources
that can be requested by the library
operating system and can be bound to
that library operating system by
exokernel and exported to the library
operating system as an encrypted key and
once the library operating system has
the encrypted key for that resource it
can use that anytime at once the second
mechanism that exokernel has a software
caching on behalf of each library
operating system specifically a shadow
TLB or caching the hardware TLB in a
software cache for each library
operating system is to avoid the context
switch penalty when exokernel switches
from one library operating system to
another basically what will happen is
that at the point of context which
exokernel will dump the hardware TLB
into a software TLB data structure that
is associated with that specific library
operating system and similarly load the
software TLB of the library operating
system to which it is switching to into
the hardware TLB we will talk about this
mechanism in much more detail shortly
but at this point I wanted to mention
that there's a second mechanism that
exists in exokernel for establishing a
secure binding between a library
operating system and the hardware the
third mechanism that exokernel has for
establishing a secure binding on behalf
of an operating system is downloading
code into the kernel this is simply to
avoid border crossing but inserting
civic code that an operating system
wants executed on behalf of it I gave
you the example of the packet filter
earlier so that's an example of
downloading code into the kernel that
needs to be executed on behalf of a
particular guest operating system and if
you think about it this idea of
downloading code into the kernel is very
similar to the spin idea of extending
the kernel with logical protection
domains that are created and dynamically
linked in similarly in the exokernel
world a library operating system can if
allowed by exokernel securely download
code into the kernel that will get
executed under specific conditions that
is laid down by the library operating
system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
