internet worm also called the Morris
worm after its creator Robert Morris he
is how the worm worked when the worm
runs on a system he looks for other
systems on internet that you can spread
to for example these systems have some
security vulnerabilities that the worm
can exploit and then by exploiting these
vulnerabilities the worm can infect
these systems in other words he can low
itself to these systems and that's how
is spread once the worm got on a system
he also employed a number of tricks in
order to keep itself from detectable
according to its creator the internet
worm was meant as part of an experiment
to measure the size of the internet for
example by measuring how many computers
are connected together however there was
a programming error in the code that is
the worm would in fact a computer
regardless whether the computer had been
infected or not already one out of seven
times this proved to be too aggressive
and as a result many computers get
infected repeatedly that is on these
computers there are many instances of
the same worm running resulting in
resource exhaustion and that's really
how the internet were was discovered
because the system UNS find out that
their servers were overloaded as a
response many see semijns disconnect
their servers from the internet in order
to stop the spread of the internet worm
but since many servers were disconnected
the internet was disrupted as well when
the internet worm identified the next
target - in fact he looked for several
security flaws that he knew how to
exploit these includes systems with
guessable passwords systems running the
finger D program they had a buffer
overflow vulnerability systems running
the same mail program there has a chap
door which means that by supplying some
special input commands one can gain
access to these systems when these
security frauds were exploited the
internet worm can gain access to a
target system it then will load a small
piece of code called the bootstrap
loader onto the target machine
and this loader would then fetch the
rest of the worm code he even used
password-based authentication to make
sure that only the bush uploader of the
worm can load the rest of the code of
the worm the internet worm also employed
a number of tricks to hide itself for
example the one called is loaded into
the memory it is encrypted and decrypted
when necessary and the original file is
removed from the hard drive so that the
user would not be able to see the worm
program the womb even periodically
change its process name and process ID
so that even when a system in looks at
what programs are running on the server
he cannot easily discover the internet
worm the internet worm resulted in major
disruption to the internet because many
servers were infected and had to be
disconnected from the internet so what
lessons did we learn the first lesson we
learned was that we need to perform
security scanning and patching the
Internet worm was able to infect so many
servers because these servers had
security flaws further most of these
flaws will not only well-known but also
had security patches or fixes available
therefore if we scan and patch computers
on the internet that have security flaws
then we can reduce the chances that they
will be infected by malware the second
lesson is that we need to have a fast
and coordinated response to a major
security incident such as the internet
worm and because of the internet worm
the US government established the
computer emergency response team or cert
for short nowadays cert is usually
responsible for issuing alerts about
security flaws and recommendations about
patches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
