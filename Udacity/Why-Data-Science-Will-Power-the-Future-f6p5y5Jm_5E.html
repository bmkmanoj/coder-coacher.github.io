Kelleher here with the audacity team
working to develop our data analyst
nanodegree which actually watch this in
four days on Monday but we're here to
talk about how data science will power
the future and I have two people with me
that can help us do just that so I have
Sebastian Thrun CEO and Founder actually
here at the Udacity team he also the
research professor at Stanford was vice
president at Google and founded the
Google X team which brought such things
as the self-driving car which everyone
is excited about and Google glass among
a lot of other innovative projects and
also with me I have Nitin Sharma VP of
engineering and data science here at
Udacity as well Newton's had a really
amazing career helping shape the
successful business strategies of
companies like the goal and Groupon and
Yahoo by analyzing the behavior patterns
of hundreds of thousands of people so
who better to talk to us about how data
science will power the future then
Sebastian and in so we should probably
first kind of think about our audience
who might have people tuning in who just
want to learn a little bit more about
data science in general people who are
excited to get into this field and
others who might be on the fence and not
sure if it's the right thing for them so
let's talk about some things that might
help them shape their their decisions
Nick first of all we might want to start
with what is data science this is the
term I hear a lot lately and let's kind
of set the stage with what is data
science so to my mind data science is
the science of systematically
discovering patterns in very large
datasets to extract knowledge and to
predict to extract useful knowledge and
to predict something of value and to do
that systematically rigorously is what
science discipline is about yeah there's
been an explosion of data available it's
exponentially growing is also an
explosion of machine power available
and as a result data has become the
future of every business and it's the
future of artificial intelligence it's
very very big great mountain views and
smack in the middle of Silicon Valley
there's a lot going on around us so you
can hear a little bit about
opportunities are what kind of projects
are out there what could people get
involved with it data science actually
happening today so I mean Valley is kind
of booming in data science right now and
there's tons of open jobs in fact data
science data analysts are in short
demand examples Netflix your movie
recommendation are based on data science
and Google your search results and your
predictions are based on data science
pretty much every company here right now
is a major a data science branch and
during the surviving car it's built on
data science and there are lots of other
cool projects that are happening in
practically every possible industry with
health and finance and retail and
meteorology and weather prediction all
sorts of areas iBM has worked on Watson
as a very cool question-answering
system that has one jeopardy and baton
the beat in the world champion in
jeopardy and now they are using it to
answer and that medical diagnostics in
the world of genetics we are analyzing
human genome data to figure out which
which people are more susceptible to
contacting certain kinds of disease in
the world of meteorology weather
predictions and there's hardly any field
today that has not touched that is not
being transformed by the availability of
data and finding interesting insights
from that data so really kind of all
over including the company that sends me
clothes every month that seems to kind
of know what I like and how I like the
threat great job thank you so there's a
lot to be excited
about getting involved in but I think
one of the really important questions
people might want to know the answer to
is is there an opportunity for people to
get into this field are there more jobs
available or is it hard to get it I mean
I can tell you right now we have
openings at Udacity Google has openings
all the comes to know about really
desperate to find more data scientists
and data engineers there's a mismatch
the data thing is kind of new and the
tools you need to understand are very
very recent statistics out but data
science as a kind of a practical field
is very new and what you learn that
colleges is actually not that new by so
most professors have been around for a
decade or so and don't quite know I
think there's one ph.d program in the
nation on machine learning it's the
Carnegie Mellon University so there's a
weekly shortage of like trained people
in the design space and an enormous
demand I think I talked to Clyde
Arapiles recently and for the day our
data science is good they believe that
the entry-level salaries are not enough
a lot a year Wow so I think the the the
world is just exploding with data be it
through you know internet usage people
using mobile phones and sensor networks
collecting lot of data and ability to
analyze the data is not scaling because
people don't have the right skills today
to analyze and make sense of that data
because of many of the academic programs
are not keeping up keeping pace with the
explosion in data I read a statistic
somewhere it was based on an IDC study
that 90% of all the data that humankind
has generated has them has been
generated in the last two years and that
that trend is going to continue for
another at least 20 30 50 years and yet
our ability to scale the ability to
analyze the data at that scale is not
keeping up so we need people with the
right skills with the right techniques
and right training to be able to make
sense of that data and get useful in any
cool thing is loves it's not rocket
science so you can actually learn it and
that's if you're a systems engineer or a
software engineer or high school teacher
or whatever you are I mean it's not I
mean
you just have to understand and know it
right great news people that are looking
to get into the industry and get a job
here there's exponential opportunity
comparatively the people that are right
now able to fill this positions and
opportunities that's that's definitely
good news
well some people watching may be looking
to get a job with the company but some
others may be interested in becoming an
entrepreneur and are there opportunities
in the field people that want to start
their own gig instead of working for
someone else I continue I mean if you
wanna start a company in Silicon Valley
in the tech field you're very likely to
hire yourself a lot of data scientists
and the reason is no matter what you do
whether it's oil drilling or it's and
medical space or you do personalized
methods and in the end of the day it'll
do buddy can be the strongest rate and
the companies that really understood
this early on were companies like Google
which started it assigns as a scale much
bigger and grander than anybody else and
as a result there's much better search
results which gave them security in the
business field amazon.com you do amazing
data science not just in the product
selection but also in the layout of the
screen the entire screen that you see is
optimized to basically convert you and
make you buy something I think that that
trend from these formerly small
companies now big companies is
accelerating so if you start a company
today and you don't do good data work
you like even fall behind and the same
is true of us you decide if you have a
data team and we have an amazingly great
intern ap running it who's would data
scientist
and it makes all the difference in
understanding our customer exhaustion
who works how content works and so on
and we leverage in this massive key and
make no education mirror so definitely
sounds like wanna be an entrepreneur and
area the very expensive quality quality
scientists so actually speaking of that
I recently heard that the Harvard
Business Review called the sexiest job
I think it's right on because the amount
of insight that is hidden in the data is
so powerful that it can make the
difference between a dramatically
successful company and average me and
the companies that are on top of the
data on what their customers are doing
what they eat what they want what do
they not not like what are they liking
any company that is on top of these
trends is has a dramatically powerful
advantage that just completely overwhelm
all their competitors so it is
equivalent of fighting evolved with
nuclear weapons versus the other guys
fighting it bows and arrows that's how
powerful data science can make it you
can really help you emboss so I mean it
sounds like you are this person in the
organization or a part of this team in
the organization you're kind of the
go-to person you know to help fuel these
things I mean just a short powerful is
the the human genome right fits on a
very small thumb drive that's basically
what it takes to decode our own genome
and the beauty of our say she thought
that you know was actually the data we
learned we spent the first kind of
couple years doing basically nothing
like the happening around and go to
speak and let's look at other stuff and
I would argue that the vast before even
television is actually you know the data
it's not that you mean oh and the same
stupid machines
I mean machines are amazingly powerful
these days and you're feeding the data
we have we amazing advances in the field
we had this thing called deep belief
networks and so on it can come in a
lotta month data and we understand data
at a much deeper level than even with
three years ago and that's really a
change anything sounds like it
absolutely so now that we know that it's
very sexy job what characteristics and
qualities they'll kind of drill down
into what do people need to kind of have
and their personality and skills really
to be able to be successful
sure that's a great question I could
start off and then Sebastian but you can
say that you agree with me or add to
that list it so one thing is I think
it's very important for you to have a
solid background in probability and
statistics and have a solid understand
of the data mining techniques and
algorithms to analyze data at scale so
that's the and with special emphasis on
strengths and weakness of each approach
in what scenario is a decision tree a
good way to build in predictive model
when it's not a stick regression a
better algorithm then is when its
support vector machines that I will to
use so having a good understanding of
the trade-offs and the strengths
weaknesses is very important second
thing I would say is the right skills
process data at very large scale
typically we are talking about terabytes
or more of data so you know you have to
have a very good understanding of what
it takes to build software that will
handle the data at that scale be aware
of the practical considerations of you
know things like outliers or filters or
noise in the data missing data incorrect
values and being able to handle these
cases in sufficient age and third thing
I would say is general curiosity and the
ability to ask the right questions
understanding the business context in
which these problems appear figure out
what is the right solution what is the
right way to solve that problem and
equally importantly communicate the
findings to the business audience so
that they can make the best decisions
based on that data I think that was
perfect I mean the only thing or Edison
first of all there's many different
levels of data scientists by the CPU
that about which people have invent new
things and new theories and then there's
Modi the technician level where people
are able to go handle these things and
do a good job by the no gonna come by
new theory and I think all of them are
important at the bottom there's many
more jobs than at the top it takes you
longer to get to at the top in any level
you also understand tools like there's a
ton of tools in the industry that people
use if you envy me everything on scratch
I'm gonna spend a lot of time so we have
tools from from there and one would you
be and many other companies you know a
repertoire that are we contemporary that
you have to understand and one of the
questions that we often get asked is
well what is the difference between the
data scientist and data analyst
and engineer and I think the lesson just
answered that question you're the
scientist for me is a person who can
invents a new crazy stuff and I mean I
have a PhD so I might be the category or
have been in the past but much more our
data endless kind of work the via the
launching is much more at a lower level
but a much more broader level and with
many more drops which is need to be able
to do meaningful or with data with
existing tools and so that's basically
where we can get you easily absolutely
so speaking about it we mentioned in the
beginning we're really excited to be
launching our data analyst and agree in
four days and so maybe we can talk a
little bit about why a place to start
why celebrate the right thing for people
to do where is your first step into the
wonderful kingdom of data science you
get to learn all the important tools you
get a solid grounding in statistics and
probability you get programming
experience and you get to a point where
you're completely employable in Silicon
Valley and and around the world so I
think it's a the perfect step if you
like what you do there's more steps to
go up to but it's a fantastic way to get
into the field and it's very little
commitment it's inexpensive it's fast so
it's much cheaper than getting a degree
from University and the baby you have
designed this program is to to come up
with a very compact plan to get all the
right skills that are needed to become
an effective data analyst and this is a
program that we have worked on making
sure that all the concepts that are
required are rigorously it is based on a
pedagogy that is rooted in learning by
doing very hands-on where you are
actually going to be developing projects
on based on real-world situations with
real data and showcase and complete the
projects of showcase it as a proof of
your competence of the skills that you
have learned was it was very practically
oriented
really designed to make you successful
as a data analyst in the out in the real
world and what's really unique about
Udacity I mean there's many different
places wearing it and a pair of science
education is really work with the top
companies in Silicon Valley so we have
like Facebook and Google are these
companies they
that's what they want so they'd be asked
in the question like what do you want
your employees your current future needs
to know and they work and build a
material with us and that's very unique
for audacity that we have these very
very strong education alliance with
these funds and this program as I said
is built with the experts in in the
field with a very practical orientation
towards what it takes to succeed not
just academically but real-world I mean
eight versus wondering this and working
with us and giving us the top experts
they preserve jobs for this so take that
nanodegree same as your application
fantastic it's a ringing endorsement
right there so you know really much
different and maybe much more relevant
today then paying a lot money going to
professional education experience which
may not have the relevant skills that
you need to know right now coming
straight from the employers that I would
like to work for that's really exciting
so with that in mind here at Udacity and
we're really well known for our courses
but some folks watching might need a
little bit of a explanation between what
the differences between taking the
audacity course and getting a Udacity
free
well the nanodegree is kind of
accumulation of our work to really
create a credential that industry
accepts and you now have north of 30
companies that are strongly endorsing it
building the content with us and
accepting those as a as a first grade
credential and it's a new credential I
mean it this doesn't match any academic
credential you're aware of it's actually
much shorter we believe the world is
becoming faster and shorter and we see
this from email Twitter so you kind of
the Twitter of all degrees now but it's
very accessible and is really accepted a
bit by industry and it's a it's really
something that I mean the companies in
Silicon Valley put their weight behind
their name behind and they're Trustin
and something that I believe it become
an industry standard to be honest so
we've had a lot of questions coming in
from the audience so
look at those uh shut up alright so um
what one of the questions that came in a
was about kind of we could recommend for
traditional software development team
including data scientists that want us
to evolve towards a more data-driven
product they want to they want to
involved in that direction maybe share
some advice sure that you just done it
so I think what is important is to pay
attention to to build the applications
with scale in mind from the get-go
because the data is growing very rapidly
and you you have to be able to design
the algorithms and the applications will
a scale in mind so you have to make sure
that the application is robust it is you
know it is robust towards potential you
know outliers or missing data or you
know potential corruption in data so oh
you you the the applications that you
develop have to deal with scale failures
and potential missing values and so on
and these applications would be you know
they need to tackle the business
problems as opposed to just implementing
cool algorithms for the sake of it right
top of it I would say it's a cultural
issue and so in sitting value of
data-driven you are very young if you go
to companies that are established and
have been around before this data
science wave aka in 2005 or and I can
handle a nine yards there's usually this
this seem that there there Rob opinions
and really very little data because the
tools didn't exist so to get a team to
be really data centric I think you have
to be kind of work also on management
mid-level management and engineers to
really accept data once you get to the
point where it is accepted where you
share data a lot of options go away in
Agra place by data and I find this
extremely refreshing so we when we look
at our content we don't argue about
opinions if you just look at the data
and
helps us set the development schedule
for our products right we had very
important value to the direction of
company absolutely so so it's kind of go
a lot along the same lines though so
somebody asked with this you know
prevalence of fake data and what are the
risks of you know maybe having five
different data scientists finding five
different results from the data how do
you mitigate for that or or what are
your thoughts on on that so if the
because the techniques Jews are are
vigorous then probably there will not be
uncovering insights that are in conflict
with each other so that's the first part
the second part is that if these five
data scientists are looking at five
different aspects of the problem then it
makes the solution all the more richer
so that is not necessarily inherently a
conflict as long as you follow the right
rigorous techniques and five looking at
problem in different ways might actually
come up with more insights that are that
helps you understand the problem and the
solutions in a much more interesting way
and where have you in my experience in
Adventist data the more common situation
is not that we have faith assigned as a
fraction of opinions is that I have a
dear science book in a completely blows
me away
let me with the self-driving car drove
it every day yeah dozens of them every
day to the present day driving around
the Bay Area and the type problems that
occurred in the data there massively
different from anything I could have
imagined and it was only the data that
helped us understand what the actual
deficiencies or and helped us really
shape the development yeah and it kind
of sounds a lot like what you were
talking about before where difference
between kind of using your own opinions
and an ideas instead of really digging
into the data and see what it tells you
you've actually mentioned the other day
to me about how we ended up with a
search bar in the middle of the screen
alright so yes data can help you
understand a patterns of usage that can
be
something that is really hard to guess
as an example this is maybe even a
decade ago when I was at Yahoo we were
looking at how users use the Yahoo
homepage and we discovered a very
interesting pattern in the data that
back there named excuses were using
search more often in the Yahoo homepage
compared to Internet Explorer users and
interestingly back then the search box
was centered for Netscape users and it
was left interested for high users so
based on that we hypothesized that maybe
centering that is getting people to
search more and we tested this you know
with 20 different versions homepage in
an a/b testing framework and we found
that the only thing that made the
difference was entering and with that
change literally overnight now whose
grew by a few percentage point yeah
that's amazing and you know led to sense
of millions of dollars of incremental
revenue and I can't think of any easier
way to make tens of millions of dollars
for a company really but is this a trend
so it's great to talking about it right
now are we concerned that this you know
big trend will kind of fade out or what
do you think the lifespan of this isn't
everything a trend um I I I'd say that
this is gonna be vilified of I don't
think we seem to the exponential uptake
right now it's quite massive and I'm you
see an ability to collect data that's
good enough exponentially and if it is a
process of expansion II and we see the
resulting benefits to go up
exponentially to be honest so I think
you're gonna be on earth for quite a
while and I actually think that this is
just a very big name the very first few
years of this of a trend that is likely
to continue for several decades the data
is just exploding as we mentioned
earlier and the amount the range of
things that we can discover uncover from
the data the kinds of insights are just
so powerful that I can't imagine any
business in another decade from now
operating without a very strong data
scientist scientist II it is simply not
possible to compete in the modern world
if you don't have a you if you're not on
top of the data about your customers
about your
business and how your your customers are
interacting with the product of Faris so
that kind of leads into another question
that was asked even that he you know
this is a very fruitful industry what do
you think he mentioned earlier all a lot
of different opportunities in a lot of
different fields but in the next five to
ten years what do you think will be the
biggest things that that come out of
this field specifically do you have a
sense for what do you think we're going
in the next five to ten years I mean
obviously what we're doing today is you
optimize like crazy everything we do so
if you have a product in the market you
have to apply data to make it really
good but I think that the next step is
actually going from very targeted
structured data professionals very have
a clear infinitely output to very
amorphous and brought their questions as
a lot of work on on data processing
technology that has like millions of our
parameters like believe networks is one
of those very popular these days
and I think that's kinda massively kind
of take over the world there's going to
be all kinds of jobs that'll be
empowered by when ability to happen in
level intelligence that is much stronger
than if you everything before so so
right now we you can fly planes
autonomously I've done the things we'd
be done away with that the next thing
before might be I don't know myself
engineers a bunch of areas I think
admins where we can use a lot science we
boost and I feel bad that the next
several years are going to need to much
more richer and much more diverse Vegas
ace images and you know events from
sensor networks text and video and you
know the world is just exploding with
all sorts of data that will open up
possibilities that we can't even imagine
today yeah I mean future artificial
intelligence is you know I must just
warn against it that's data I mean what
is happening in the eye right now is all
about machine oh and it's all about data
so if we've just test ten years from now
the tools the skills you're gonna pay
without the data will be essential to
make machines
amazing very exciting things to come so
we have a couple more questions coming
in a lot of people watching me we're
very interested in getting a job in this
area and somebody has specifically you
know they look at job opportunities for
companies out there and almost all of
them say you need relevant work
experience three to five years work
experience
what are your suggestion for someone
that doesn't have that work experience
and maybe they do have the basic skills
what do you think that they should do I
mean the way you get work experience is
that your work right so they're not true
that you have to have work experience to
find a job otherwise none of us will
ever have a job so um the degree that it
be offering the nanodegree is speedy
properly suited for someone to get their
first job in the field and maybe you
come in different work experience and
have you been a software engineer before
you become a data analyst and you
leverage this may be a completely new
and English major or what have you and
it's your first kind of or into a bit of
science no way there's going to be jobs
for such a demand right now and yes
experience is important I think it's
important to take what we do into the
field we do as good a job I think as it
can do in terms of learning by doing and
getting experience in our educational
contexts that we offer but we've done
offering if I feel small experience so
that's something that I would recommend
China we find this very first job and
apply what you learn improve your skills
sharpen your axe and open the atmosphere
as much yeah and to add to what's the
best and just said we explicitly
designed the nanodegree to have our
projects be based on real-world problems
with real data so that you get
experience working with real data sets
that approximates the world's real work
situations as closely as possible so
that you get a feel for what kind of
problems to work on and what are the
constraints what are the limitations and
then you complete these projects they
can be the showcase of the skills or
competence that you have learned yeah
that will give you an edge even if you
don't have a three or a five year work
experience and as the best and said
that is not the only thing that matters
because otherwise we would never have
gotten our first job but how to give
these practical experiences is what is
now ready and we get a sticker from
partner companies right these are the
companies that want to hire you right so
they say look if you can solve this
problem here then we believe you are at
the caliber I would love to hire you so
you're not just fake randomly created
artificial things they're real
well you can take this portfolio that
you have really demonstrates your skills
and what you're able to do and you don't
have to you know three to five users in
it and a job it doesn't necessarily have
to be I mean a little plug here from a
machine learning class at the end I said
you were dealing with is going to be the
Enron data remembers the company they've
been bust a few years ago and the entire
email conversation as we made public and
it's become the reference data set for
understanding fraud and text learning
and so on and it's exactly the data that
people internally use or for detection
and said companies and finding Ana
criminal behavior and so on analyzing
email they might just be one specific
aspect but it's the kind of data that
our partner companies would love you to
be able to master and you can you can
learn that now and more and more
companies and government institutions
are making datasets available for
anybody out in the world
to analyze and you know find interesting
patterns Netflix has a data set about
its users and its preferences for their
preferences course certain movies and so
on CDC the Center for Disease Control
they have at least some data and more
and more companies more and more
organizations are making available these
data sets for anybody out there to
analyze elementary school teacher we do
work really hard and the area of stem
that's a big area right now and you
would get real-world problems you would
connect with somebody in industry and
then pose a problem and second graders
are working on how we can solve the
problem having enough water in countries
and and so it's a really exciting time
to be in that you're able to interact
with this data specifically and work on
problems and not have to wait to be in a
company or something to assign you that
role there's a good thing I mean brag
about live with ourselves here of
audacity because it is very strong
industry alliance we can
and it's like Google and Hadera and
Facebook to kind of give us clear
problems and I believe is development
because these companies know what they
want right it's not that ice in the
corner and think about it and I'm
professor and do this for 30 years and
its really kind of grounded in practice
typically wants to know what are the
programming languages so if we get a
little bit more specific what
programming languages should they start
learning to get into this field so it is
more about the about the the
foundational techniques and algorithms
but a few programming languages that are
getting very popular Python and are
probably the biggest examples is what we
teach them and I would suggest for
someone who is new to the field to focus
probably most on these languages yeah so
it's a five in an hour I'd also say that
there's a whole bit of tools the
industry uses I don't know MapReduce and
so on for scale there you have to just
know so we've been walking with Quran
and - and so on to teach those skills
and at top of the programming languages
right because these tools are pre coded
tools to take your idea of scale going
live on Monday is inter machine learning
which are an instructor in I'm a cool
instructor prepare folks to not only
kind of gain the skills but then
presented offer and they way to think
about this unit you know I'm trying to
do it with college we're not saying when
you are like a not sixteen seven years
old
we do a liberal arts whatever creative
thinking education we really want to get
you to the skills needed in Silicon
Valley as fast as possible so we're
really focusing on one thing which is
how do we turn you into an analyst so if
you are smart and and and ambition and
and and willing to work it some robots
was involved we can turn you into a very
you can learn in your bedroom you can
learn in your bathroom on your train so
considering all the technologies which
have been kept okay we think that the
price with how much of an insight table
is figuring out which of those
technologies to use at a company versus
opposed to analyzing video itself and
Nitin you may have talked about a little
bit about this earlier yes so I think
most of the emphasis should be on
understanding the problem domain and the
structure and what techniques would best
apply to solve the problem and not as
much on the choice of the programming
language I would say the biggest
decision that you probably have to make
is what kind of algorithms to use and
what are the features that you need to
put in your prediction model and that is
the most important decision to make
rather than the specific choice of the
language yeah never I mean when you get
in and you are a drop in their analysis
the number one frustration will be there
the tools you've learned about aren't a
great fit for the problems you really
want to solve like very often when I ask
a question and whose don't really let
you ask this question so the data might
be changing over time and is missing
features and so on so that the skill of
taking something in the real world to
care about and then take this toolbox
over here
whichever languages in a close match
that's the most important skill what's
the number one source of frustration to
be honest because I in class you'll find
that using subscriber is very great
because he instructs us chose problems
about really complained but in the real
world as you go to a project face online
now a nun degree you'll find it's really
hard sometimes to make this connection
and that's what you wanna learn and no
fear it's completely miserable and these
these are the kinds of issues that you
will deal with hands on as you go
through some of our projects yeah so you
look at that
great well speaking of specifically
someone asks is it appropriate for
someone with significant experience in
software development
many data science programs and seen in
the past in vain for someone who is
brand new department program oh yeah
it's a good thing you can go your own
pace and you can go as fast as you want
right so we don't like normally the
occasion there's something called C time
the way you get credentialed in academia
is you have to take some number of hours
in our case you don't care we care that
your skill that you can do it that you
have the mastery of the material so if
you are an experienced programmer please
come to us you'll be much much faster
and you can breeze through the parts
which require you know software
experience of building large-scale data
applications if you are already strong
in probability and statistics you can
select those parts and focus more on the
software development so basically
whatever skills you already have you
don't need to go through all of them
because our programs are designed to be
flexible yeah we can focus only on the
things only on the topics or concepts
that you need to learn and develop
expertise in it we launched another
degree a little bit earlier and we had
the first five weeks cut out we leave
five weeks and pop-unders came back
after 24 hours and hit solve all this
and it's obviously they didn't know
anything I'm scratching and you do a lot
of stuff in advance but the nice thing
about the online problems about our
problems is they we afford to the
flexibility and hopefully I mean we
believe you spend your time wisely if
you follow that really really good
education individualizes personalized
people can kind of start where they are
and move forward that's great
so a couple more things here so some of
that I mean they're excited about the
nanodegree and they're just concern is
are the project's enough to show the
companies that they're qualified is it
something that if they put it in front
of an employer you think it's gonna have
an equation is yes right well you know
instead of or a degree and actually
having real-world years of concrete
thing that I did right so the industry
is evolving to a to the point where what
matters more is the portfolio of your
projects that you have done then the
piece of paper or the degree that you
have acquired most employers
care about what you can actually do and
the best proof of that is these projects
or you know give your github
repositories and so on already many of
the companies are asking for github
repositories rather than your you know
college transcripts so the world the
professional world is especially in the
tech is already moving in that direction
it's I mean certainly here in Silicon
Valley is very noticed
I mean yet if you go across the country
or the world I'm sure that kind of a
degree from MIT is worth a lot and
honestly I wouldn't really recommend
anybody to drop MIT enrollment cooee for
nano degree at this point although maybe
in a year or two level but what is quite
amazing is the velocity at which
companies are willing to accept this new
credential I think you find amazing
soldiers but neither the said is what we
hear every single company say we care
about that our people function well in
our environment and the credential that
you might bring from a traditional
education institution or from Udacity or
anybody else is just a pointer towards
your proficiency we have the advantage
our and then the wheel is built by
industry right so it's built by the
people that might end up hiring or so we
you believe you're closest to the job
that you can possibly be
and as VP of engineering I can tell you
that for our own hiring we lay more
emphasis on your project portfolio and
you have repositories in your library
and eventually the Nano tepees rather
than on the actual degrees or your
college transcripts we don't even ask
for polish transcripts anymore
absolutely we had a bunch of all on
people yeah so along that line Nitin
someone's kind of asking what's an
example of some of the work going on
here at Udacity Dave great so cool thing
about Udacity is that we have probably
one of the richest datasets on how
students learn so and able to track
things like when a students struggling
through a course when is it that they
pause a video lecture and rewind and
watch the same thing over multiple times
because that can offer us clues on which
parts are tough for students how we can
improve the exposition of that topic we
keep
track of how much time people take to
concert quizzes how often they get it
right how often they get it wrong how
much time does it take for them to
eventually get it right and these are
the kinds of things that give us a very
tight feedback loop on how effective our
courses are how effective students are
and in a few few years we would be in a
position to have very clear specific
intervention and perhaps personalized
paths of learning to our students yeah I
mean isn't kind of tortures us potata
regularly and says here's data guys look
at this oh my god about portal content
and we offer but through their process I
can tell you and we started out these
several NASA more modern courses our
finishing weights from median were like
single course like 3% 5% the best 10%
and now our best course is north or
magnificent and that's really been
meticulously looking at like what
intervention makes sense absolute for
success and how can we change the way
you do deadlines maybe do courses
community mentoring the Vino offer a lot
and all these things to make the courses
as good as possible it's quite amazing I
mean education it's interesting because
education is by these fields that's kind
of live with medieval um we have about
1.4 million college professors and they
all have opinions about how to irrigate
very few people are falling the ability
to really look at student data in five
minutes and that's why the nice things
about us the company they behave the
data and we're using it in the
traditional campus courses the
professors and the students don't get
that data or a feedback on what kind of
teaching techniques are more effective
than the others
what really contributes to learning
aspects of teaching are effective and
which are not and that is the advantage
of the online education and online
learning platforms that it affords you
that capability and that is honestly one
of the reasons why I got excited to
Udacity and join here to you have
changed the world of Education to help
students learn a much more effective
uses data point how data how being a
data analyst can make you change the
world right so this is for education you
can do any other industry and finds
fantastic well with that on wait data
science will power our future it's a
change the world and so excited
everybody joined us today don't forget
you're interested in doing our dating on
nanodegree please visit the link and we
will send you more attribution launch a
Monday but thank you so much have a
wonderful day and stay you Davis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
