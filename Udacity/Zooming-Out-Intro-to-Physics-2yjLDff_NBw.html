see the curvature of the earth
interesting now our experimenter who is
sort of gigantic in comparison to the
earth now when she drops her Apple same
as before it goes straight to the center
of the earth but now when she throws the
Apple it goes all the way over here
before we were zoomed in and we're
looking at a flat earth the Apple would
have stopped right here but it keeps
going a little extra distance due to the
curvature of the earth let's zoom out
one more time here's her experimenter
once again and here's the center of the
earth so now she's really quite a giant
of course if she drops the Apple it goes
straight to at the center if she throws
the Apple well it all depends on what
speech he throws that if she doesn't
throw it too fast it'll follow some
curved trajectory in strike the earth if
she throws it really really fast it'll
leave the earth and be gone before the
earth has a chance to pull it back now
somewhere in between these extremes if
she throws it at just the right speed
the ball will travel a certain distance
and of course fall a little bit towards
the center of the earth it will travel
another certain distance and of course
fall again and keep up this process of
traveling and falling and traveling and
falling in just such a way that the path
it takes is a circular orbit around the
earth and that's all due to an
attractive force that wanted to pull the
Apple towards the center of the earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
