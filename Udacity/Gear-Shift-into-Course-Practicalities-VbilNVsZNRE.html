ground already we've heard a lot about
what accessibility is and why it matters
for everyone we heard about some
different types of impairments and what
we might need to think about we saw what
it's like to use a screen reader and we
took a quick look at what CAG and the
web aim accessibility checklist but the
rest of the course we're going to dive
into the practicalities of actually
creating accessible websites that's
right we're not going to just talk it
you for the whole course you're going to
actually create some accessible code
yeah so we're going to organize this
around three main topics focus on
keyboard looking at how to make sure
that we build things which can be
operated with a keyboard this is
important for users with motor
impairments but also ensures that your
UI is in a good shape for the next topic
which is semantics semantics is where we
make sure that we're expressing our
interface in a robust way which works
with a variety of assistive technology
and finally styling and visual design
look at some techniques for making sure
the visual UI is as flexible and usable
as possible now each of those topics
could probably fill a whole cost by
themselves so we're not going to be able
to cover every single aspect of creating
accessible websites how we're going to
give you enough information to get
started and point you in some good
places to learn more about each topic
I'm sure you're all eager to get started
so let's begin with a look at how and
why you need to think about focus in
your web application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
