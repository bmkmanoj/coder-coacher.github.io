forest model and all trucks interpret
the results and validate the model and
we've already created samples of 70% for
the estimation sample and 30% for the
validation sample so let's bring in a
force model and configure it so we can
find this forest model tool within the
predictive category the first thing
we're going to do just like all the
other models is simply name the model so
I'm gonna call this F m4 forest model
underscore transportation since that's
what we're trying to predict then next
thing I want to do is select what is my
target variable which is going to be the
mode and then lastly what are my
different possible predictor variables
so gender age marital status and drive
distance in miles and so far this is
exactly the same thing that we've done
in all the previous models up to this
point now what are some of the different
options the first option is the option
rate below which is the number of trees
to use so remember that we have a forest
model here which is a ensemble of
decision trees and even with the logo
you can see that it's many different
trees as compared to a decision tree
which is one single tree this option
right here is to choose how many of
these individual decision trees that we
want to actually make so this can be 300
it can be 200 it can be 5 it can be a
thousand whatever you so choose
typically we leave it at default which
is 500 then we go back and we change
this based off of some of the results
that we're going to view in the future
the other options could be seen in the
model customization options what is the
minimum number of Records allowed in a
tree node so just like before the
smaller number the more splits that are
going to occur now the last two
configuration options revolve around a
concept called bootstrapping
which you can read more about in the
reading notes this is a more advanced
technique and for the purpose of this
course we're going to keep these values
and options at the default places so I'm
going to bring it up browse tool after
this are a report output there's no
interactive
result for this model so I'm gonna run
this and then I'm gonna allow you to go
and learn a little bit of what you're
gonna be looking for in the results in
the next section then we're gonna come
back and actually view the results from
this model</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
