or covenants continents are neural
networks that share their parameters
across space imagine you have an image
it can be represented as a flat pancake
it has a width a height and because you
typically have red green and blue
channels it also has a depth in this
instance depth is 3 that's your input
now imagine taking a small patch of this
image and running a tiny neural network
on it we say K outputs let's represent
those outputs vertically in a tiny
column like this now let's slide that
little neural network across the image
without changing the weights just slide
a cross and vertically like we're
painting it with a brush on the output
we've drawn another image it's got a
different width a different height and
more importantly it's got a different
depth instead of just our G and B now
you have an output that's got many color
channels K of them this operation is
called the convolution if you patch size
where the size of the whole image it
would be no different than a regular
layer of a neural network but because we
have this small patch instead we have
many fewer weights and they are shared
across space a covenant is going to
basically be a deep network where
instead of having stacks of matrix
multiplied layers we're going to have
stacks of convolutions the general idea
is that they will form a pyramid at the
bottom you have this big image but very
shallow just RG and B you're going to
apply convolutions that are going to
progressively squeeze the spatial
dimensions while increasing the depth
which corresponds roughly to the
semantic complexity of your
representation at the top you can put
your classifier you have a
representation where all the spatial
information has been squeezed out and
only parameters that map to contents of
the image remain so that's the general
idea if you're going to implement this
there are lots of little details to get
right and a fair bit of lingo to get
used to you've made the concept of patch
and depth
patches are sometimes called kernels
each pancake in your stack is called a
feature map here you're mapping three
future maps to K feature Maps another
term that you need to know is stride
it's the number of pixels that you're
shifting each time you move your filter
the stride of one makes the output
roughly the same size of the input a
stride of two means it's about half the
size
I say roughly because it depends a bit
about what you do at the edge of your
image either you don't go past the edge
and it's often called valid padding as a
shortcut or you go off the edge and pad
with zeros in such a way that the output
map size is exactly the same size as the
input map that is often called same
padding as a shortcut</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
