volume of a box if we know the length
the width and the height of the box so
let's take another look at how Athena
was folding her boxes she take a piece
of paper like this one then she would
measure square in each corner of her
rectangular piece of paper then she'd
cut the squares out of the corners and
then she would fold up the edges and
tada with a little bit of tape we'd have
a pretty nicely put together box so we
know then that we can make a box out of
a piece of paper that looks like this it
once was a rectangle until I cut the
squares out of the corners let's draw
that on here so here's a nice little
piece of paper for us to start out with
and then I can draw this to show what it
would look like after the corners have
been cut out of it awesome now on the
real piece of paper that i was using
this one the original side length of
this long side was seven inches and the
original side length of this shorter
side was five inches so let's pretend
like this paper has the same dimensions
so this original side length was five
inches and this original side length
down here was seven inches now Athena
and I are both super careful people so
we made sure that the squares that I cut
out of each corner are exactly the same
size that means that each of these
lengths of a cutout square is the same
let's call that length x now I'm going
to give you a second to refresh your
memory on how this box looks when we
fold up the sides so here's my real one
again this length is X this is 7 inches
and this is 5 inches when I fold it up
it looks like this we have length width
and height now my question for you is
once I folds up this box what will the
height of the box be please put your
answer in this box and just a hit it may
not just be a number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
