not allowed to access the data of any
other origin than its own an origin is
made up of three parts the data scheme
the hostname and the port for the page
you're on right now the scheme is a GPS
the host name is wwwdcom and the port is
443 if you change any of these parts you
are on a different origin and different
rules will apply apart from the mixed
content problems we talked about earlier
this is another reason to not mix HTTP
and HTTPS URLs but what are these rules
that apply once you are working across
multiple origins first of all you can't
make fetch request to other origins
actually under certain criteria you can
but then you can't read the answer
secondly you cannot inspect iframes or
windows with JavaScript if they are from
another origin these rules make a lot of
sense if you think about it let's assume
I was allowed to make fetch request to
other origins I could just set up a
website that makes fetch request to
facebook.com and steal all your facebook
messages or even worse I could make
fetch request to udacity.com and make
you drop out of all of your Udacity
classes no we don't want that this
restriction or rule is called the same
origin policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
