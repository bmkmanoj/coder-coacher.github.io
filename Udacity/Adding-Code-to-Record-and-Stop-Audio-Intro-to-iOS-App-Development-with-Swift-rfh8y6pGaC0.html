view controller right now and what I've
done here is that I've embedded the code
that we saw in the previous video in
this file let me walk you through it
first I imported avfoundation and then I
declared an object of av audio recorder
globally then I added all of the code
from the previous video to the record
audio function this includes a print
statement which will print the name and
the path of the file where we have
recorded our voice now while I'm at it
let me add code to the stop audio
function also here I will stop the audio
recorder and then deactivate the audio
session I encourage you to google and
figure out why we need to add these two
lines to our code by the way all of this
code that we have added in this file is
available in the instructor notes for
you to play with all right I'm gonna run
my project so now when I hit the record
button I get a print statement here in
the debug area of my Xcode this seems
like the file name with the current date
stamp that has been printed today is
November 4th 2014 and it's just past
12:00 p.m. where I am so it seems like
the file name is correct okay let me try
this one more time and see if the
timestamp actually changes there and it
seems like it does the timestamp now is
looking at 12:00 p.m. 2 minutes and 36
seconds one last thing to notice here is
that even though we've been able to
successfully print the name of the file
we still don't know if our audio is
being recorded successfully let's find
out more about that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
