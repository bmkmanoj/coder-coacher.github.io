developing for mobile devices is the
display screen the typically small
screen compared to a desktop or laptop
display forces you to focus on what's
really critical for users if you user on
a phone sees your investor relations
link on your mobile web apps homepage
you're probably doing it wrong unless
your app is for an investment firm but
of course if you have more surface you
want to use it you don't want the small
bit of text and a big empty window
design either in fact this is what's led
to the recent adoption of the mantra
mobile first it's not really about
writing a mobile web app or a page
before the desktop one it's really about
stripping your app or page down to its
core user functions and then layering
additional gravy back on top if you have
appropriate room this lesson and the
following ones are designed to give you
the tools to build designs that can
scale across multiple screen sizes and
scenarios now the complexity of these
lessons may lead you to ask the question
hey do I need to be building one site
that scales across desktop and mobile or
can I just have a separate mobile site
no okay that's a little strong but there
are still problems with having separate
mobile and desktop sites which of these
might be problems that you would
encounter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
