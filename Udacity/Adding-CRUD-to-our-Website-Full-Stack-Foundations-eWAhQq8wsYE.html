now that we have a working web server
let's see if we can add some credit
operations to our site this will be a
fun activity where you'll finally bring
together all of the major aspects you've
learned about creating data-driven
websites in this next section you are
going to modify our web server code such
that we can create read update and
delete restaurants from our restaurant
in your database I will be adding these
features in the next five sections
divided up into objectives I highly
encourage you to read through the
objectives descriptions that I'll be
presenting in a moment and attempt to
solve them before seeing the solution
videos up until now we've been moving
pretty quickly but this is an
opportunity to slow down and get messy
figuring out these challenges I'll be
sharing my answers with you but through
this process you might even create more
elegant solutions than my own before we
get started coding let me list off the
objectives I want to complete for this
project listing objectives helps me to
understand the scope of my project and
create identifiable milestones along the
way these objectives should also serve
as guidelines you should follow to
complete this project the goal of
objective 1 is to modify the web server
dot PI file so that opening localhost or
8080 slash restaurants the user sees a
list of all the restaurant names in the
database to complete objective 2 after
the name of each restaurant there should
be a link to edit and delete each
restaurant these links don't have to
work for now they should just be visible
the third objective goal is to add code
such that there's a page to create new
restaurants with a form for writing the
new restaurant name the form should
create a post request that creates a new
restaurant menu item in the database to
complete objective 4 we enhance the web
server such that users can rename a
restaurant and persist this edit to the
database via post and the last objective
creates a feature such that by clicking
delete takes the user to a confirmation
page that then sends a post command to
the database to delete selected
restaurant if you don't get it on the
first attempt or have to spend some time
debugging or looking things up online
that's ok even the best of programmers
have to debug code try to spend about 3
hours working on each of the objectives
before viewing the solutions if you're
still relatively new to programming
don't forget to use your resources like
the Python documentation and tools like
the source code inspector in chrome to
help you debug your program and don't
hesitate to ask questions in the forum I
will be going over this too
- this challenge piece by piece solving
each objective in order once you're
finished with an objective continue to
the next video to see my implementation
of the solution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
