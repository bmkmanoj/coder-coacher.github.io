more feasible way of proving theorems in
logic of proving the truth value of
sentences and logic we should point out
that so far we have been using only
propositional logic propositional logic
is sometimes also called this 0s order
logic the key aspect of propositional
logic is that it does not have any
variables so as an example I may have a
sentence which says if the animal lays
eggs and the animal flies then the
animal is a bird and here I'm talking
about a specific animal but sometimes I
might want to talk about animals in
general any animal all animals in that
case I would want to introduce a
variables in it so in first order logic
also known as predicate calculus I might
want to say something like if X lays
eggs and X flies then X is the bird
which has a set form very similar to
form here except that instead of animal
I not have a variable now I have a
variable here but I must also specify
the range of the variable and what I
really want to say here is for all
animals therefore I'll introduce a new
quantifier over the variable X is
quantified as called a universal
quantifier it is generated with this
symbol this is a symbol for a universal
quantifier and this says now for all X
if X lays eggs and X flies it implies
that X is a bird one thing to note here
is that I could have rewritten this
sentence with the universal quantifier
back into propositional logic by having
lots of sentences like this in
propositional logic so I could have said
lays eggs and evil one flies animals one
implies bird animal one lays eggs animal
two and flies animal two implies bird
animal two and so on and so forth for
each and every animal that is possible
but by writing it in the form of a
variable in Universal quantifiers in it
I can reduce the number of sentences I
have to write and do just one sentence
so we've introduced variables and we
have talked to at least about one
quantifier so far the universal
quantifier that applies for all values
that that variable can take sometimes I
might want to specify a different range
of the variable not all values of the
variable can take but at least some
values that are variable Mac can take so
consider again the sentence here the
animal is referring to a specific animal
now let us look at the second sentence
on the screen and this sentence is the
variable Y it says that if while is eggs
and Y flies then it implies that Y is a
bird this sentence is a very similar
form to the previous sentence except for
the variable Y I can specify the value
that the variable Y can take this time I
want to specify not that this sentence
is true for all values of Y for all
animals but supposing I want to say that
it is true for some at least one animal
in which case I use an existential
quantifier here is the symbol for an
existential quantifier this existence or
quantifier says it there is at least one
animal for which the sentence happens to
be true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
