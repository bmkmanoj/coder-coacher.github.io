performance reports you go to
conversions ecommerce and sales
performance in this report groups
results by transaction you can drill
down into a transaction to see all the
products include it in the transaction
here I've only got one product per
transaction because our a bassoon for
the current dinner is the only product
in the cart but here's an example from a
different app with more transactions
I'll drawl down into this transaction ID
and you see that the customer bought
several things in a single purchase
transaction the revenue for the
transaction is the sum of the prices for
the products included in the transaction
in this transaction the customer bought
several different shirts so the total
revenue is the sum of the costs fall of
the shirts that's a lot of shirts for
one person I hope they all fit so so far
in our app when the user hits the
purchase button they buy the currently
selected dinner and they pretty much
have no choice about that but usually
customers liked by things by the
cartload rather than selecting and
paying for items one by one so to tell
analytics at the user bought multiple
products in a single transaction you
just add whatever products you need to
the hit to be sent to analytics so
create a product object for each product
in the cart set the names at all the
other details and so on then you create
the product action you set the action to
action underscore purchase set the
transaction ID and then you can
optionally set a product action list if
you want to group all the products into
a list you don't have to do that though
and then you get the tracker as before
and you add each of the products do the
tracker and then you build and send the
hit this is pretty much the code that
you've already learned how to write the
only difference really is that you can
add multiple products now I know some
people say it's not polite to talk about
money in public but I really do want to
bring up a couple of matters to
with money every product has its own
price this shirt cost 10 when you send
an action purchase hit to analytics the
total price of the transaction is
automatically calculated from the price
and the quantity of the products in the
transaction that's cool right kind of
what you'd expect sure is hmm but if you
take a look at the API reference for
product action you'll see there are
methods for setting the revenue the tax
and the shipping if the tax and the
shipping irrelevant you'll need to write
the code to add them to the transaction
November I said that you can set the
name of the list that's associated with
the given set of products if applicable
by setting the product action list on
the product action the list name shows
up in a product list performance page
you can in this case there's two product
lists one without a name and the other
one is all the things and then if you
drill down into all the things you see
the products that were in the product
list and you can find out what they
contributed to the product revenue for
the list I don't have a coding exercise
for you related to calculating taxes or
setting product lists but feel free to
explore on your own up next though you
do have a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
