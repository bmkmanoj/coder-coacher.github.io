through the process of meiosis end up
with only 23 chromosomes whereas the
germ cells their parent cells had 46
chromosomes this is essential to make
sure that at fertilization the sperm in
the egg combined 23 chromosomes apiece
to get 46 total the complete genome
necessary to make a human now this
particular process of DNA duplication
with two rounds of cell division is
unique to meiosis and only germ cells do
it all other cells in your body divide
through a process of mitosis where
there's one DNA duplication event and
only one cell division now take a look
at the gametes here the sex cells
produced as a product of meiosis there
are no chromosome pairs anymore every
chromosome pair split up and alleles
ended up going to their own gamete this
is called the law of segregation this
law simply means that allele pairs
separate during gamete formation this is
something that's been known for a very
long time in fact Gregor Mendel who you
saw in Lesson one was the first person
to ever identify this particular
phenomenon so based on what you see here
and which you now know about the law of
segregation what is the probability that
the dominant lactase persistence allele
the plus symbol here will get passed on
carried on to the next generation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
