RSA has the security properties we need
we've seen that it has the correctness
property that encryption with the public
key and decryption with a private key
are indeed inverses but we want to know
also the most important property that
it's difficult for an attacker who
doesn't have access to the private key
to perform the decryption so this is the
property that we need that given enn
which is the public key it's hard for an
attacker to find D we actually need
stronger properties than just this we
want to also know that the attacker
can't learn anything about the message
this is not strong enough by itself to
know that an attacker can't learn
anything about the message and in fact
we'll see there are cases where an
attacker could learn something about the
message without learning D soon so the
first thing we know is that this would
be easy for someone who knows the
factors P and Q the two large Prime's
that we multiplied to get N and we know
that because such an attacker could
compute the multiplicative inverse of e
mod the totient of n and if you know the
factors of n you know the totient
because that would be the totient of P
times the totient of Q which are both
Prime's
so easily solved so our security
argument relies on two things the first
is that showing that all ways of
breaking RSA would allow some easy way
to factor N and if we could use that way
of breaking RSA to factor n then we
could always use that to factor large
numbers and that would contradict our
second claim that factoring large
numbers constructed by multiplying two
large Prime's is hard we're going to
show the first thing first that other
ways of breaking RSA other ways of
finding D would allow us to factor N and
then we're going to argue from
experience and historical effort that
factoring seems to be hard so the first
question is whether it's easier to
compute the totient of n than it is to
factor in so our goal is to show that
that's not the case what should we do to
show that so here the choices given P
and Q show that it's hard to compute the
totient of n given the toshin end show
that there's no easy way to compute P
and Q or given the totient of n show
that there's an easy way
to compute P and Q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
