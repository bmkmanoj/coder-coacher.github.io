the return value to things have to be
true first it has to actually match this
regular expression and second it has to
be in this string so a1 does match this
regular expression we're looking for
things like a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 blah blah
blah and there's actually an a1 in this
string so yes to be does not match this
regular expression for this particular
regular expression the first letter
always has to be a letter and not a
digit this doesn't work out b2 looks
very promising it's one of the strings
we would match except that it's not
actually found in our haystack string so
it can't be part of the return value CC
doesn't match because we're looking for
things like a1 b1 c1 that have a digit
in the second position this is not a
digit cc3 does not match because it's
three characters long and we're looking
for strings that are two characters long
44 doesn't match because it doesn't
start with a through z d4 looks very
good so the sort of thing we would match
from this regular expression but it's
not actually in our haystack string
instead we have 4d the empty string this
was a bit of a ringer or distractor
thrown in doesn't match our regular
expression it's too short it's 0
characters long and we're matching
things that are two characters long but
finally see three matches our regular
expression and its present in the string
so yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
