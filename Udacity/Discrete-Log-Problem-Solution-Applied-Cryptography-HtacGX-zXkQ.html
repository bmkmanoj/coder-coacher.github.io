were possible to compute discrete logs
quickly and our adversary had a way to
do that well then they could compute the
discrete log of the intercepted value y
a the G and the Q values which were also
intercepted those ones were public and
the result of this would be the XA value
that was Alice's secret and then the
adversary can compute the key the same
way that Alice would this was the only
secret value and if you had the discrete
log function you could compute that
secret value the second answer doesn't
compute the right thing it's computing
the discrete log of YB which would be
the Y a value that's not the value that
is necessary to compute the key the
third value doesn't use discrete log if
we could actually compute the key this
way well then the protocol would be
completely unsecure because it turns out
that modular exponentiation is a
function that we can compute efficiently
and it's necessary that we can compute
modular exponentiation efficiently
because otherwise the legitimate
participates in the protocol wouldn't be
able to determine their keys so we'll
look at that soon before doing that I
want to emphasize that this is not a
proof that breaking discrete log is hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
