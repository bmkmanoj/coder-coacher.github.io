assignments and controls and in the
class we talked about how to make a car
follow a straight line we used the line
x equals zero where the crossing error
was defined as the Y difference between
this axis we just read of the value so
now I'm going to make more interesting
course a cyclic course a race course so
here's my race course it has a radius R
which you can set and the way I'd like
to define this race course is through a
half cycle of radius R same half cycle
over here and the stretches in between I
want to be 2 R along so for example is
radius equals 25 meters then this will
be here 50 meters the whole thing will
be under meters and this dimension will
also be 50 meters I want you to program
it such that the initial car is
stationed right over here point it
upwards and then it dries onto the race
course like this all the way around
infinitely often the key in doing this
is going to be to set a function I have
already modified for you the function
run from our control class to use that
cross-check area with the parameter
radius which we're going to set to 25
but I can pick a different value in my
testing and then I have modified a
little bit the update over here to
maintain the differential and the
integral cross stick arrow and here's
our steering control law that you are
familiar with instead of twiddle I'm
just gonna give you parameters 10 15 and
0 those work from fine for me and they
actually the result of running twiddle
without the integral apart and then when
I run it I get my output and here it is
the crosstrack error by and laughs is
very small you can see the steering
tends to be on the negative side here
we're staying in the first turn here in
the straightaway you can see this by the
magnet with the numbers here we go into
a turn again so the batoning becomes
larger in all of this you find the
crosstrack error to be relatively small
about 0.1 or so not very much and this
continues and continues the final cross
Sagara for the second
half of the race is 0.005 so you want
this number to be really really small
now the tricky part is when you code
this up and code the function CDE you
need a different branch for this area
here for this area over here this area
over here this area over here keep in
mind that the robot is going to go in a
cycle so it's going to traverse this one
in the opposite direction with this one
over here so good luck coding up the
correct crosstrack error function</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
