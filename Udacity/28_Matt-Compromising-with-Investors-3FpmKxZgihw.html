working with an investor there are some
compromises that are going to have to be
made and one way of thinking about that
is when you make your first pitch to an
investor the investor starts formulating
in their mind what they think this
company should become what the product
should be and that may not be the same
idea that you have in your head is the
entrepreneur and actually part of
picking the right investors is is there
alignment between these visions the
division that the investor shares in the
vision that the entrepreneur shares and
no matter how close those two visions
are sometimes there's going to be some
differences and as an entrepreneur what
you have to decide is when the investors
vision is slightly different are you
going to adjust are you going to
course-correct and when you're thinking
about doing that and you're thinking
about those compromises it's important
to take a step back and think about it
from the investor's perspective they're
not in the weeds they're not in the
detail maybe they're looking at the
bigger picture maybe they're looking at
other companies in the marketplace and
you have to constantly evaluate you know
should you course-correct or should you
really remain on your vision ultimately
though if you're taking money from
investors there are going to be
compromised as you have to make they're
going to ask you to do things that may
not have been your first priority and
sometimes you're just going to have to
do that and that's it comes down to you
know making sure that your investors are
really good and that their ideas are
sound and if they are sometimes they're
going to tell you something that you
didn't think of and you're going to have
to correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
