about drone strikes from pitch
interactive as we enter the
visualization we're taken through an
author driven narrative step by step
with an accompanying drone strike
animation this is the narrow stem of the
martini glass as we click through the
final visualization starts to build each
element fades in slowly with annotations
about notable events during that period
notice that up until now it's been
linear with a single path we're still in
the stem of the martini glass after the
visualization is finished building we're
invited to look into the data more
closely we're now in the wide mouth of
the glass and it's become a viewer
driven narrative instead of an author
driven one I can mouse over specific
data points in a tooltip appears
allowing me to dig into the data more
closely I can also click on the tabs in
the upper left to pivot the data and
look at it in other ways recent news
about drone strikes is included below
keeping the visualization relevant and
current hopefully you can see how this
particular visualization combines with
the author driven and viewer driven
elements to make a compelling narrative
let's look at one more in this example
Paris Copic shows us a visualization of
the number of gun-related deaths in 2013
it starts with a few victims and
projects out the number of years that
would have lived without gun violence it
keeps a running tally and the
visualization builds exponentially
similar to the previous example there's
a clear narrative as we enter the
visualization and then we're invited to
apply various filters to this data for
example I want to look at males that are
over 30 and the southeast I can either
look at their projections here or look
at a graph
also included is two major insights that
the majority of victims are men and boys
and that the young people are
significant portion</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
