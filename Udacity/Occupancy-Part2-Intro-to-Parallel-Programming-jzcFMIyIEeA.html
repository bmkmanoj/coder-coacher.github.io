SM then I'm getting a maximum of 1024
threads on that SM so my occupancy is
not as high as the SM could handle you
can get these vital statistics for the
particular GPU you're programming to by
looking it up in the CUDA reference
manual or by making various CUDA calls
on the GPU and it could sdk ships with a
sample called device query we saw it
earlier that conveniently collects all
of these information into a single
useful utility so earlier we did a
printout of the device query the result
of device query on my GPU let's look at
that again it prints out a lot of
information earlier we were using this
to estimate the total peak bandwidth by
looking at the memory clock rate and a
memory buts with now I want to draw your
attention to the total amount of shared
memory per block the total number of
registers per block the maximum number
of threads per multiprocessor our SM the
maximum number of threads per block and
here's the register and shared memory
usage for our tiled transpose kernel
going back into n VPP we can see that
we're launching a grid size of 32 by 32
a block size of 32 by 32 we're using
seven registers per thread and we're
requesting four kilobytes of shared
memory per block so given the register
and shared memory usage for the kernel
that we just saw and given the GPU
statistics from device query running on
my laptop that we just saw how many
thread blocks per SM can we run and how
many threads per SM can we run and which
resources are preventing us from running
more are we limited by the maximum
number of threads per SM by the maximum
number of registers per SM by the
maximum amount of shared memory per SM
or by the maximum number of thread
blocks per SM</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
