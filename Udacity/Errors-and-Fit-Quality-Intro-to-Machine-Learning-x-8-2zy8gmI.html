so if you got it right good job let's
walk through the answers one at a time
the first possibility that you minimize
the error on the first and the last data
points isn't a bad thing to be keeping
in mind you certainly want to have a
good fit to the first and last data
points but you could easily end up with
something like this
where the trend of the data as a whole
might look like this but if you're only
basing it on the first and last points
you would ignore all the data in between
and come up with something that isn't
fitting the pattern as a whole the next
choice the sum of the error on all the
data points might have sounded like a
good idea but here's one place that it
can go wrong
suppose you have really lovely linear
data like this but you fit it with a
regression that looks like this clearly
not a very good fit however if this
error is let's say negative 100 and this
error is positive 100 then these two
will cancel each other out and likewise
for this point this point this point and
this point so the sum of the error in
this case will actually be zero even
though it's a terrible fit that's why we
usually don't use the sum of the errors
two things that will work a little bit
better will be the sum of the absolute
value of the error so in this case what
would happen is we would turn all of
these into positive errors these three
points right here and then these were
already positive so altogether the sums
of the absolute values of the errors
will be quite large so that would
probably work and the last thing that
will work and that we'll explore in more
detail this is actually how linear
regressions are calculated is by
minimizing the sum of the squared error
on all the data points this has the
advantages that you get with the
absolute value of the error because even
if you have an error that's negative
when you square it it becomes positive
and of course if it's positive to begin
with it'll still be positive after you
square it so this will work as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
