are represented by their coefficients
for example a is equal to negative X
plus 1 times X plus 1 times x squared
for example if you've ever worked with
polynomial interpolation or fitting
before however you will know that an
order n polynomial is uniquely
characterized by its values at any n
distinct points the order of a
polynomial by the way is the number of
coefficients used to define it or the
degree +1 hence we might just as well
represent a polynomial by its values at
a sequence of inputs as by its
coefficients for example that same
polynomial could be represented by
saying that a of negative 1 is negative
2 a 0 is negative 2 and a of 1 is 0
going from the coefficient
representation to the value
representation can be thought of as
matrix multiplication to calculate a at
some value I take the dot product of the
corresponding row of the matrix
consisting of the powers of the argument
X with this column consisting of the
coefficients of the polynomial a this
matrix is important enough that it gets
its own name and is called a vandermonde
matrix its determinant is the product of
the differences of all the values of X
so as long as these are distinct the
determinant will be nonzero and that
means the matrix is invertible so given
the values then we should be able to
recover the coefficient</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
