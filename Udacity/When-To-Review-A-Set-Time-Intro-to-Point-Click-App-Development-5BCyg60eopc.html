approval process what we're gonna do
here well Before we jump into making the
approval process we need to think about
what are we actually trying to create a
flow for okay so we have our stage
managers and they need to approve
whether or not bands can be booked at
certain set times okay so we want to
create an approval process on that time
sometimes make sense when a booking
agent tries to book something the stage
manager has to sign off exactly cool
okay so I guess I'll just search for yep
it's in setup okay okay workflow and
approval school approval process it's
recommended that I follow the following
instructions I'm not gonna do it though
so rules are meant to be broken
yeah manage approval processes for set
time right exactly okay create new yep
quick that guy oh I have a choice of
wizards jump start wizard or a standard
setup do you have a preference I use
jump start it's quicker okay okay name
for the approval process um
stage manager sign-off maybe yeah sure
stage manager approval whatever
oh yeah I call it purpose mm-hmm so
approval assignment email template what
are we doing that are even sending an
email so we could if we wanted to but we
don't have to so in this case it's okay
okay so we've got a specific entry
criteria use this approval process if
the fine criteria are met so this is
really similar to the workflow rule
right where we're trying to come up with
some certain criteria that this should
only fire this process if something
happens it's true if there's a baseline
okay and so when would we not want it to
go for approval like one really like
this is bad data this shouldn't be under
approval because it's not complete there
wasn't a field miss if there's a field
missing exactly and so what's the most
important field onset time that would
has to be there in order for it to be
something we should review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
