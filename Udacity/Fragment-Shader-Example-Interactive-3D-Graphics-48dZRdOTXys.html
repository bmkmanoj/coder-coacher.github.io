color were generated by the vertex
shader these are passed on to the
rasterizer which interpolates these
across the triangle and creates
fragments each fragment is then passed
through the fragment shader you'll be
happy to hear this shader is very simple
all this shader does this takes the
interpolated color v color and copies it
over to GL Frank color the built-in
output variable for what color appears
on the screen
the fourth coordinate is set to the
alpha value which says how solid the
surface is this is normally one
notice how the language elegantly
understands vectors V color is a vector
with three coordinates we construct a GL
Frank color a four element vector by
using V color and appending a number
GLSL knows what this means in general
the language is very aware of common
vector and scalar operations here's
another example of vector operations say
we have an input specular color and a
specular amount we've computed a value
for the specular variable how much it
should affect the fragments color in
this line of code we multiply this
variable a single floating point number
by a vector with three elements we add
this to the fragment color by specifying
which components we want changed here
the RG and B components are modified the
component names for the four elements
are XY Z W for points and vectors
RGBA for colors and STP Q for texture
coordinates s and T are sort of like U
and V I won't go into all the features
of the language see the additional
course materials for full references one
thing worth mentioning is that there are
all sorts of built-in functions some
you'll probably be familiar with such as
absolute value sign power and square
root others are more specific to
graphics such as normalized dot cross
product and reflect for debugging shader
code the browser's debug console can
often give useful errors for example in
this line of code I've put a
representation for a floating-point
number it's perfectly valid in C but is
not part of the GLSL language so it was
flagged here sometimes the errors are a
bit cryptic in this case the zero should
be a zero point zero GLSL is very picky
about having a floating-point number
have a decimal point in either case
you'll get a blank screen or not much
warning otherwise I've sometimes found
myself adding a line or two at a time
and seeing if everything stays on the
screen if not I comment out the lines
until my scene reappears I call this
binary search of debugging</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
