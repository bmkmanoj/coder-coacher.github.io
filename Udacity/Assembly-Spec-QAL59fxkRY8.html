one of these forecasters is sure so at a
very high level forecasting is a pretty
simple problem which what it basically
is about we do some analysis to to
calculate demand to forecast demand of
products in the absence of any kind of
promotional activity or any in any other
kinds of events special events that
might cause spikes or troughs in demand
and that generates something called a
baseline forecast so we have some
algorithms that are responsible for
generating baseline forecasts by doing
an historical analysis of sales data we
then have a separate set of algorithms
that that calculate what we call
incremental sales this is this is
additional uplift or in some I guess it
could also be negative uplift from the
baseline when when certain special
events are in play like a promotion a
Mother's Day promotion is going to cause
an uptick in the sale of flowers and
gift cards right Christmas is going to
yeah or any other kind of holiday is
going to have an uptick in sales so we
tend to think of a forecaster the thing
that actually calculates forecasts as
being decomposed into a baseline
forecaster and an incremental forecaster
and each of those things can be
parameterised and then put together to
form the actual forecaster that you want
to use to generate for kids to calculate
demand for products at given stores so
that's a forecaster kind of at the
abstract and gives you some idea of what
some of the features in it are and how
they might now that might compose and
can you give us a picture of what this
forecaster is like in terms of its
assembly spec so if you look at this
slide you'll see a very simple example
probably the simplest example i call it
the hello world forecasters and you'll
see it just has four lines right so
those four lines explain how to generate
four different components that are used
with one another so we've got in this
case we've got a really simple one
called be forecast for baseline forecast
one called multiply multipliers these
are the multipliers that are used to
calculate the incremental uplift when
there are different promotions and such
an in place we use these two components
be forecast and malts to generate an
incremental forecaster that calculates
the actual incremental forecast and then
we put the incremental forecaster and
the baseline forecaster together into a
component called batch which is a batch
forecaster and so what that does and we
can go into in a moment exactly how it
does it but as you can see we start with
some kind of elementary components the
baseline forecaster and the multipliers
and then we compose those with some some
reusable features inker and for
incremental and fcst for forecaster we
compose those together to make an actual
component called batch and batches the
is the component that's kind of the
output of this thing that would you
would then installing your database to
calculate your forecast so is this the
description of one variant this is the
description of one variant that's
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
