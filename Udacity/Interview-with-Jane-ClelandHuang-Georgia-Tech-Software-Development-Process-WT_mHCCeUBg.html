starting this lesson on requirements
engineering I want to ask a world expert
on this topic a few questions I'm here
with a Jane Cleland punga a professor at
DePaul University and Jane is a world
expert in the area of requirements
engineering which is the theme of this
lesson so I'm talking to Jane was a
currently in Chicago and I want to ask
her a few questions about requirements
engineering so how Jane how are you and
thank you so much for agreeing to be
interviewed for our course I'm sure the
students will really benefit from this
working with stakeholders to discover so
you might have different stakeholders I
think this is my last question here is
what happens if major stakeholders with
challenge number but clearly
in many respects related to security and
performance and reliability and these
are all parts of the requirements
process things that we should have the
first should have been discovered and
the system should have been built
getting the requirements right in first
place puts us a project on the right
foot and so that gives us a much better
chance of delivering to the customer
what they need and designing a solution
that really meets those requirements so
it's a critical that's critical and if
we better get our requirements right
that's that's the message okay well
thank you so much again for taking the
time off your busy schedule to speak
with us I'm sure the students really
appreciate this and we'll talk to you
soon
bye Jane bye bye Jane give us an
interesting perspective on requirements
engineering and its importance let's now
start our lesson with the general
definition of requirements engineering</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
