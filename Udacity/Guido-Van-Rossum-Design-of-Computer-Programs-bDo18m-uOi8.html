guido van rossum inventor of the Python
programming language
I stayed relatively close to ABC and
ABC's ideals just sort of naturally led
to a language that is easy to learn and
easy to teach I was in his situation
where my two choices were on one hand
shell which is easy and nice for simple
scripts but sort of limited if you want
to do anything complex especially at in
those days when it was like well before
bash it was the original Bourne shell
that I mostly had to deal with and then
on the other hand the C language which
you can use to do anything you want
including implementing your own
programming language but it all takes a
lot of effort and it's easy to make
mistakes that only sort of come out much
later after you've already implemented a
lot of code you'll realize oh I should
have used a different kind of data
structure start over from scratch that
original computer programming for
everybody
idea in part was just a ploy to get
funding from certain corners if I may
admit to that and one of the reasons
that in the end not much happened was
that the funding turned out to be much
harder to obtain than just writing a
proposal and winning some contests which
we all did successfully and then getting
the funding turned out to be still an
impossible hurdle I know plenty of
teachers who have been teaching Python
to high school students at some level I
heard recently that somewhere in England
there is a national initiative that at
least considering I don't know how sort
of how much that actually became a
definite plan to teach Python to all
high school students there which is a
great idea the wonderful experiment and
no matter what the outcome a lot will be
learned from that experiment
