protection stuff we've been talking
about is that it could be used to sort
of create these fences or isolate these
different applications from each other I
was talking about process a cannot
access memory that currently belongs to
process B but the same mechanism
actually could be used to isolate the
operating system remember we wanted to
tamper resistance for the operating
system you shouldn't be able to alter
from untrusted application code so we
can isolate the operating system from
untrusted application code using the
same memory protection mechanisms we're
talking about so the way we do that is
we're going to say the operating system
also called the colonel is going to
reside in a portion of each processes
address space so the the address space
in which a process execute so now has
two parts where the user code and data
is going to go and where the operating
system is going to go operating system
code and data so the OS resides in you
know and that part of the address space
is is common across different processes
is going to be in a portion of the
address space so think about the address
space there's a user portion user area
and then there's OS kernel area and this
holds for each and every process that we
have in in the system and remember that
we talked about system calls and things
like that whenever you want to go from
the user side user portion of the
address space to the system portion of
the address space that transfer has to
be special and handled by the operating
system can only be done through the
system calls that we're talking about so
one way want you to think about is that
let's say this is the address space that
process a execute n then we said there
is this fence or boundary the OS goes
here the user code goes here and when
you are here when you executing this
portion you not allowed to access this
part of the memory remember the the
execution mode that we are talking about
so the hardware is going to say if you
are in the user mode and you asking for
an address here that's not going to be
allowed ok so the way oh
system is isolated from application code
which is untrusted is essentially
putting those in separate places and
making sure when you hear you can't go
into the operating system well there are
these we said the call gates or
controlled entry points through which
you can comment but then we coming in by
making a certain call the operating
system understands and the operating
system is going to do whatever checking
it needs to do and then you're going to
be executing in the operating system
while you access anything here and when
you're done you're going to return back
to the user level so we use the same
memory protection mechanisms you're
talking about phase tables the
protection bits what different ways
tables we have four different processes
for the operating system so remember one
of the things that you know I can't
overemphasize is the operating system or
the trusted computing ways that we have
has to manage these page tables because
page tables control what portions of
memory you can access and in what manner
and the operating system says this is
you know your code you can execute it
but you can only execute or this is your
stack you can read write it but you
can't execute from it that's an onyx
executable stack and things like that so
this is how the operating system is
going to actually protect itself from
untrusted process codes and also allows
these unrested processes protection from
each other so process a can't for
example corrupt the memory of process B
because the way the address translation
and the protection mechanisms work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
