extraction step what actually happened
you get the the DNA or the saliva sample
in the lab what do you do to get the DNA
out so DNA extraction is a very you know
normal thing that happens in labs all
over the world there's nothing special
about who we have we do our DNA
extraction but the process is really
trying to separate the DNA in the
nucleus of the cell from the proteins
and other components of the cell that
otherwise would be in the way I see in I
mean how much DNA do you get out of the
saliva sample that someone sends in it's
actually a very variable so depending on
the person we can get anywhere from 10
micrograms to over a hundred micrograms
DNA a lot and as most of that variation
happened just based on the number of
cells that were in that spit sample or
saliva sample we think so but we
actually don't have very good
information on that we know that some
people saliva is more watery than other
people and we know that for example
infants do not often give us good data
and we think that's partially because of
the water enos of the about saliva well
for those people who might be wondering
you know what kinds of cells are you
actually getting in my spit what what
are the actual cells that you know
you're extracting DNA from when you're
looking at my saliva so in a sense it
doesn't matter in that almost all of
your cells have your genome in there and
it's always the same genome so we don't
look at that too closely we know that
the major components there are
epithelial cells so the inside of your
cheek the skin cells there and the and
white blood cells are the other major
component now I i do floss and brush my
teeth but i know that i'm sure i have
some kind of bacteria or germs in there
even still um is that a concern at all
worrying about sort of having other non
me DNA in my spit sample again it's not
something we worry about too much we
know that people have a lot of bacteria
in their mouths and we know that from
person to person there's huge
variability in the composition of those
bacteria but for amplification we are
happy to amplify up all of your human
and bacterial
DNA and then let the sequencing or
genotyping process sort out the human
from the bacterium i see so as long as
it's human it's good but does that mean
like I you know I shouldn't go kiss
anybody right before I give my DNA
sample for the 23andme test we actually
collect two milliliters of saliva from
you which doesn't sound like a lot but
it can take up to five to ten minutes to
fill that it's a lot of saliva you would
have to be kissing a lot to make a
difference enter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
