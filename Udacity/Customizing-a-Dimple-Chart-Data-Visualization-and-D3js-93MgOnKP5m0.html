the dimple library and usually this is
possible with any library built on d3 is
how we can interact with the dimple
created charts with native JavaScript
CSS or d3 code to add additional
customizations here we can see the chart
that we created as a combination of a
dimple scatter and a dimple line but one
improvement I want to add is to color
the scatter circles of red to draw more
attention to them well we can do this
through dimple code d3 code or
JavaScript code the simplest way to make
this slight change is to use CSS when
customizing a chart created by another
higher-level library we often need to
find some class or ID to select the
elements in this case the circles if we
inspect element and look at the SVG
created by dimple we can see here it's a
circle element with the ID equal to the
date and going over further we can see
that there's a bunch of classes added to
it since we want to make all the circles
read the ID won't work so we have to
pick one of the classes or a few of them
that change the styling on all the
circles in this case it looks like all
the circles are dimple series - one
class which is probably a good guess for
a class attached to all of the circles
and none of the lines which we can then
use in a CSS selector in our HTML file
we simply need to add a CSS style to the
page as a whole that selects circles
with dimple series - one class here we
are selecting the circle elements with
dimple series - one and we're changing
the fill property of the SVG circle to
be read saving our file and reloading
our page you can see here that the fill
of the circles is now red which makes
them a little bit more distinguishable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
