links for now next I want to focus for a
little while on the notion of a
clustering coefficient now you might be
less familiar with this notion of
clustering coefficient than you are with
paths and graphs so let's go through how
this is often defined what the
clustering coefficient is trying to
capture is as I said before cliquish
nests how likely is it that two nodes
that are connected are part of some kind
of larger highly connected group of
nodes so one typical way of defining the
clustering coefficient is to start off
by talking about the clustering
coefficient for a particular node in a
graph we're going to generalize this to
clustering coefficients for the entire
graph next but let's focus on a single
node so let's say V is that node and
case of V is its degree and n sub V is
the number of Link's between the
neighbors of V so let's let's look at
this example graph to ground out some of
these concepts so here we've got graph
let's call this node V could point to
any of them but I'm gonna go with this
one let's take a look at the neighbors
of V those are the nodes that are
directly connected to V in the graph
we've got this one and this one and this
one and this one so the number of those
neighbors is the exactly the degree of V
which in this case is 4 and now let's
look at the links between these
neighbors of V so there's this one that
goes between the two pink nodes and that
seems to be it this node isn't connected
to any other pink node this one's not
connected any other pink no this is not
connected to any pink node and so on so
in this case n V is 1 and then we're
going to combine these quantities
together as follows we take twice the
number of neighbor links divided by the
degree of V times 1 minus the degree of
V now this may look a little odd but
let's let's compute what it is and then
then I'll explain it so in this case 2
times n V which is 1 divided by K times
K minus 1 so that's 4 times 3 and the
result we get in this case 4
particularly is 1/6 so what this
represents is actually the fraction of
possible interconnections between the
neighbors of V so because it's a
fraction we're expecting it to be
something between 0 and 1 and in fact we
can get 0 if we've got something that's
like a star so V has edges going out but
none of those connect to each other and
it can actually be all the way to one if
it's if we have a clique so V is
connected to its neighbors and all the
neighbors are connected to each other so
that's why this formula has the form
that it does K V times K V minus 1 all
divided by 2 is the maximum number of
connections among a set of nodes of size
K V so we take the reciprocal of that
multiply it by n V that gives us the
fraction that we're looking for so in
this case V is 1/6 it's you know a six
of the way from being a star from from
being a star to being a Creek so it's
not that tightly connected and in fact
you know that's sort of what we saw as
well that these connect to do a bunch of
neighbors but they're not really
connected to each other all that much
and we're going to say that the
clustering coefficient for a graph is
just the average of the clustering
coefficients of the nodes in the graph
so if we wanted to compute the
clustering coefficient of this graph
we'd actually have to go through no - no
- no - no - no - no - node compute the
clustering coefficient for each one and
then average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
