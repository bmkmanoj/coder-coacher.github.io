building as an input to sat is going to
become even larger so as you have seen
before the calculation that a
non-deterministic Ram makes for a given
input can be represented as a polynomial
number of snapshots and I'm now going to
draw the snapshots only like this you
know that it represents the input the
program the read/write memory as well
what we've already seen is that the
state of the non-deterministic Ram at
each point in time can be represented as
a snapshot and that snapshot can be
represented as a boolean formula so now
that we found out how we can encode a
snapshot into a boolean formula let's go
back to our main mission showing that
any problem that can be solved on a
non-deterministic Ram can be encoded as
a SAT formula and the idea of this is to
build a huge well not that huge it's so
going to be polynomial size but it's
still going to be very large so the idea
is to build a very large boolean formula
as follows each time step of the
algorithm is going to be represented as
a snapshot then we're going to ensure
that the first of these snapshots
represents the memory of the RAM at T
equals 0 what that means is that the
program starts at the first line of
execution and of course that the memory
contains the input that we're giving to
that program or algorithm then thirdly
we have to ensure that the snapshots fit
together what I mean by that is even
though it's a non-deterministic Ram if
at a certain point in time say T equals
x it is in a certain state then at the
next time step T at X plus 1 there's
only a limited number of choices or
potential states that machine can be in
so if we were having a deterministic Ram
actually as we already said the state of
the machine added time point X already
clearly determines what state the
machine will be in at point x plus 1 for
a non-deterministic Ram if you use the
if-better operation then there can be
two different states at the next time
point and then finally we have two inch
that the boolean formula that we're
building as an input to sat can only be
satisfied if the algorithm returns yes
at some point in time otherwise because
we have a decision problem if the
algorithm returns no we do not want the
boolean formula to be satisfiable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
