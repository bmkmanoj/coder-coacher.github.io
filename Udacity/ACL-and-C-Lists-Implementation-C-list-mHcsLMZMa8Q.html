implement a Ciel's operating systems
have researchers have studied seedless
as well and we will see there are some
nice properties they offer so how would
you implement sealless so first of all
when would I see list go where would it
be stored
remember see lists are per user see list
we get from each row of the access
control metrics so it's per user so it
naturally place for it is not going to
be where we kept ACLs the other question
one can ask is what exactly is a
capability a capability remember says
you know you are capable of accessing
that resource you've been given
permission to access that resource so
typically a capability limitation
details differ but it's really a handle
for a resource a reference allows you to
find or you know locate the resource and
be able to use it so if you can go use
the resource you shouldn't be able to
forge a capability for that resource
capabilities are sort of identifiers you
can think of them or references or
handles for one property the system has
to guarantee is that these capabilities
or handles that we're talking about are
unforgeable so think about the user has
capabilities for a bunch of resources
list of those capabilities is what
defines a c-list for that given user the
way we sort of where the list see list
is going to go we have to have a catalog
for each user that we have in the system
similar to
ackles for each resource or object that
we had before here we have to have a
catalog of capabilities and a system has
to store this catalog of capabilities
for each user that we have in the system
they've been capability based systems
that have been explored and one of the
interesting ones with the system called
Hydra was sort of a research project
done at Carnegie Mellon this actually
you could have see lists stored in
objects themselves so everything was an
object it was an object based system an
object stored sealless when you came to
a certain object well you found new set
of capabilities and you could then use
those to access objects that you
couldn't access before you can access
this new objects while you are within
this
and you could take capabilities back to
the object you came from sometimes and
not other times and things like that the
basic idea is that capabilities are how
you decide the system makes a
determination what you can access or not
so you the user has to start with a
catalog and as you execute maybe new
capabilities come your way and that was
this example that we're talking about so
one thing we didn't talk about is
actually how does sharing happen the
whole idea of you know who can access
what and giving access to somebody else
the example or the quiz questions we're
doing is how does sharing happen with
ACLs we didn't talk about it but someone
who has the right to let somebody else
access a resource and make a system call
and say this new user or this user that
I'm specifying should be able to read
this file foo and what we're gonna do is
create a new ace for this user if one
isn't already exist and going to add
this new access right to that and then
you know put that ace in the ACL so the
new user will be able to go and access
this file in the future capabilities
what do we have to do
sharing is gonna require propagation of
capabilities the new user we should be
able to access this resource in the
future we have to provide this Newser
with a capability for this resource so a
capability has to be propagated but
remember they shouldn't be able to force
it don't be able to sort of mint a
capability unless it has been passed to
them or someone had chosen to share the
resource with them the capabilities
sharing is going to happen by
propagation of capabilities I'm gonna
give you a capability you're going to
find a way for you to gain access to a
capability that you can then use to be
able to use the resource remember that
one difference here is that possession
of a capability means you can access the
resource there is no access check
required as was necessary with ACLs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
