don't know but I know how to do it
alright I'm just going to substitute in
the equation we had before yeah that's
what I was thinking so M is greater than
or equal to one over epsilon times the
natural log of the size of the
hypothesis space hmm which is what
that's not one of our variables here Tim
yeah right so it's not two to the tenth
even though the input space is two to
the ten the number of hypotheses there's
one hypothesis corresponding to each of
the bit positions so good plus the
natural log of one over Delta so that
would be greater than or equal to ten
times the natural log of ten plus the
natural log of five so let's see the
natural log of ten is something like
three point something natural log of
five is something like to point
something B add those up multiply it by
ten you're going to end up with thirty
nine point one two good so we need you
know forty samples yeah
that sounds about right actually doesn't
sound too bad though you know it's not
learning a very hard problem but it's
you know it's a pretty big input space
so let's see what how big is the input
space it's two to the ten which is a
thousand forty-four yeah so how much of
a thousand twenty-four is forty since
you know less than four percent that's
not bad
before we leave this quiz let me point
out one more thing that this bound is
actually agnostic to the distribution
from which samples came so this idea
that it's from a uniform distribution is
actually not being directly used here so
so this is pretty cool it actually
doesn't matter we only need 40 samples
no matter what the distribution is it's
not like some distributions are harder
or easier because we are measuring the
true error on the same distribution that
we use to create the training set so if
it's a really hard distribution and some
tough examples never appear then we're
unlikely to see them in the training set
but they're not going to contribute very
much to the true error well that makes
sense so the district alright so in some
sense I mean I guess the equation
doesn't show this but in some sense the
distribution is cancels out
the training and the the Traer yeah it's
a way to think about it I like that
so 40 is pretty good to get 10% error if
we wanted to get say only 1% error then
we would go from 40 to 400 that's a good
point
yeah and it's it's one decimal point
even and so that would be about 40
percent of the data yeah it's true
yeah if we want to go a little bit
beyond that we may need all just a to
have multiple times mm-hmm yeah but this
example doesn't look so bad so let's
just move on before we think about it
too hard
okay that's inferior like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
