course the debug view hierarchy this was
recently added to Xcode and it allows us
to dig into the visual hierarchy of an
app while we're debugging so to make
things interesting let's run the
application and I'm going to create a
couple spiders there we go and let's set
a breakpoint in the add bugged view and
jump back and drop into our breakpoint
from here there are two ways to access
the debug view hierarchy the first is in
the debug navigator and we get to it by
going to the debug navigator and then
selecting this view high art UI
hierarchy from the drop down from this
icon here so we'll select it and if we
look at this unfolded list we can see
all the different UI image views the
bugs essentially that are being created
and we can see where they're located if
we click on one of the items in the list
this is where it gets interesting and
brings us to this visual display of our
view so you know as I'm selecting on
these these are the bugs if I click on
this it's talking about the buttons that
we have and there are the bugs now if we
click and drag this area this is really
cool it explodes into a 3-dimensional
view of our view hierarchy and we can
see visually now some of the
relationships between different elements
in the view and just like the list we
can select the different components so
I'll select this one that's the UI
navigation transition view just like
that one
let me zoom out just a tad there we go
that's what our the UI image views
there's a UI image view that's the UI
navigation bar background and so on now
let's go over to the controls that are
available to us dragging this bar in the
lower left hand corner will allow us to
increase and decrease the spacing
between the components in the hierarchy
the next two buttons can toggle showing
clipped contents and constraints which
does not do much for us here let's just
leave it as is and the third button from
the
left can flatten the view back into its
two dimensional form next are the
viewing modes which include contents
wireframes and wireframes and contents
and let's just leave it as wireframe and
contents for now after that we have
these minus and plus icons which are for
zooming and then if we click the equal
sign it will adjust the zoom so that it
maximizes your view based on the space
that's available to you now this last
control what it does is that adjusts the
views that are visible from you going
from the bottom must views on the left
to the topmost views on the right so if
I start by dragging from the right and
moving left we should see the things on
the top disappear before the things on
the bottom do and hold up let me zoom
out there we go and those are all the
controls that we have on the bottom the
next thing that we can do in the debug
view hierarchy is get diagnostic
information about the components we've
selected in the utility area so you'll
want to click one of the components and
then to display the utility area make
sure that you've toggled on this icon
here there we go and here you can see
information about the components type
uiimageview its raw address some state
information and a display showing its
content the raw address hint-hint can be
casted like we did earlier in the
command line interface to gather more
information about the component itself
so you can see how this would be
incredibly useful especially for games
and other applications with a lot of
things going in and out of the view this
is a really cool way to debugger
