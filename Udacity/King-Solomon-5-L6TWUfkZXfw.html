want you to figure out what would happen
if we got all the way down to step 5 and
a is let's say the mother okay so what
would happen in step 5 against the baby
hey it's the baby a pays V&amp;amp;B pays F so f
is the f is basically a penalty to be
for lying right and it's sort of a
penalty to to a but but it should be
well depends on how much be sets the
value V for know that's right so what
would be set the value okay what were
the possibilities okay it could be like
1 million dollars right so that would
definitely discourage a from saying yes
okay so I'd say you picked a million
dollars because you think a million
dollars is more than the value of the
baby to the real mother yeah I guess so
okay so some value V greater than be
real okay which were the sake of this
discussion let's say is 1 million
dollars okay excellent so I'm gonna
claim that be would never do that be
would never oh so the disincentive for
be for that is that a can be like you
know what I can't afford a baby at a
million dollars it's more than my actual
value of my baby to me you get the baby
but you're gonna have to pay the million
dollars right now that's not just
something that could happen that's
something that would happen right
because we've tied everything up in the
value so if V is bigger than V real then
we get down to here and ask is it your
child a will say no because paying vie
for the baby is more than what the baby
is worth and so be will get the baby but
we will pay v what do we know about the
V is bigger than V real which means it's
also bigger than V fake got it so okay
so we're assuming that be has a value of
B fake right so or the worst well in
this case we're assuming a was the real
mother and B was not he was the real
mother and B was not yeah yeah that's
right so the B has a value of V fake so
then what value of V would be pic so be
shouldn't be willing I mean be doesn't
want the baby for more than V fake
that's how much p values the baby and if
B suggests a value V or announces value
V in step 3 that's bigger than V fake be
might get a B is B is B
is at risk right right if getting the
baby and overpaying right and having to
pay mr. weird Economist's are weird but
that's okay so that means that not only
will be not picked something bigger than
V real V would not pick anything bigger
than V fate yeah and in fact imprintable
be would rather pay up to V fake to get
the baby anything less than that and if
he doesn't get the baby baby's going to
be sad for not having offered more so at
the end of the day he's gonna pick V
fake as V okay so be pics V fake as be
yeah then what do we know is going to
happen at this question when a gets
asked if it's your child he's gonna say
yes it's going to say yes right well
because if the value that be announced
is V fake and a is you know would have
regret for not getting the baby no for
ya for not getting the baby and not
bidding up to be real now bidding is
probably not the right word but let's go
i'm kind of suggesting a being a would
have been willing to pay up to be real
for the baby so a would be happy to pay
V fake for the baby because of you fix
lessons be real yeah so a will in fact
say yes a will get the baby will pay
less than the value for it and what
happens to be what happens to be b pays
a nominal fine right but that's greater
than 0 0 so if they both thought this
all the way through now we can unroll
back all the way to step 2 where b is b
is asked is this your child now be is
saying i could say no and a gets the
baby and i just walk away i get 0 or i
could say yes and i'm going to end up
paying a fine right so and another well
but at least a is gonna have to pay a
lot of money so ha it's all built into
the value all right so that means that
since the B is never going to be willing
to assert a V greater than V fee which
means that B is never going to be able
to make it so expensive that the real
mother would say no B has no reason to
ever let it get this far because b will
pay something we will get minus F which
is less than zero which means if we ever
get to step to be will bail and say no I
