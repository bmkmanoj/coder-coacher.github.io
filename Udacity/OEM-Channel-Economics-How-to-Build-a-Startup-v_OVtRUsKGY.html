economics but this time assume you are
an original equipment manufacturer and
your product becomes some other
customers cost of goods so let's assume
this diagram on the top is a laptop
computer sold through a computer
reseller channel and let's say this
laptop sells for $3,000 and like any
other channel the end user assumes they
get a discount the reseller is taking a
profit but gee that reseller was
actually buying these laptops from a
master distributor now remember back
here the manufacturer of the laptop had
their cost of goods sometimes
abbreviated cogs which include
manufacturing cost components and such
and finally they had their sales costs
their R&amp;amp;D costs and their general and
administrative costs and finally after
all that they make a profit so where do
you fit this is just a laptop
manufacturer assume this is Apple or HP
but in this case you were a graphics
chip supplier to Apple or HP and you
were just one single component on their
motherboard well if you really think
about it you were fitting in here in
their cost of goods and now your cost of
goods your sales general and
administrative costs your profit and now
you're a reseller costs now in some
cases you might have been selling
directly your parts into HP or Apple and
you would not have reseller costs but
you would have more direct sales costs
remember this stands for sales general
administrative costs and so your profit
is miniscule compared to what the laptop
manufacturer is making but you might be
selling millions of single chips and so
that profit is multiplied by that
high-volume
when you OEM a product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
