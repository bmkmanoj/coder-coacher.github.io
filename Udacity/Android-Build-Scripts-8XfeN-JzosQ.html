project and then have a look at the
default build scripts will give our app
a domain and a location we'll set a man
SDK and we'll add a blank activity with
the fragment we'll leave the defaults
for the fragment so here we are in our
newly created Android app if we go ahead
and halt out the ancient test device and
then run our application let's see what
happens alright sweet looks like we're
up and running so let's dive into what
Gradle configuration is present by
default again the project pane has
defaulted to this Android centric setup
but I find this kind of confusing so I'm
going to switch back to the project view
to just show the straight-up project
layout so here's our project and here's
our build.gradle file there's a whole
lot going on in the default Android
build scripts for starters this is
actually a multi project build and the
Android app itself is a sub project
we'll talk all about multi project
builds in Lesson four but it's set up
this way so it's easy to add other sub
projects that we want to build together
with the app like libraries or even a
back-end there are two things to notice
in this root build script first we
declare a build script dependency on
comma Android tools build colon Gradle
colon one point two point two there are
two things to note in this build script
first we declare a build script
dependency on this artifact coordinate
this is where the android plug-in for
Gradle lives second and we'll talk about
this part of the Gradle API soon but
this block adds the J central repository
to every sub project of this build that
means every sub project can just declare
dependencies and they'll automatically
be retrieved from J Center now let's
take a look at the build script
specifically for the Android build which
is in the app directory so here's the
build script for the Android app note
that first applies the android plug-in
which had fetched from json ur all
configuration happens in the android
configuration block all that's
absolutely required are the first two
lines defining the SDK version and the
build tools version the default config
block configures attributes of the
Android manifest we'll talk about the
build types block momentarily finally
the dependencies block works just like
Java dependencies this declares to
compile
time-dependency is on every jar in the
libs directory and on the android
support library</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
