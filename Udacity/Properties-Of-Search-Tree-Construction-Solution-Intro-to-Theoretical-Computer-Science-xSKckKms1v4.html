tree is correct because it still tries
all possibilities it's just smarter
about avoiding stupid possibilities and
what I mean by this is basically that it
deliberately avoids this case here where
you have two endpoints of an edge not
being at the vertex cover so it tries to
avoid those are there special cases
where the algorithm could be wrong no it
still searches through all possibilities
again it just does so in an intelligent
way to avoid making any stupid choices
does the search tree at each level
determine the assignment of at least one
vertex yes that one is definitely true
because if all edges would be covered
then the algorithm would be done the
search tree would not go much further
the usual case would be that we actually
do an assignment for two vertices and
this will also tell you something about
the answer down here so usually when we
have an edge that is not covered we will
have the case that we actually determine
the assignment for two vertices there's
one special case and if you have found
that special case yourself then you have
truly understood search trees but if you
haven't then just listen closely and
don't worry too much about it there
might be the following case where you
have an edge that is not yet covered but
you've already made the decision for one
of the endpoints the question is now
what to do with this one year but this
is actually a case that is rather easy
because here we don't really have to
make a choice anymore because we know
this edge must be covered so whenever we
decide for one vertex that it is not
going to be part of the vertex cover
then we can put all of its neighbors
into the vertex cover automatically we
do not need to make a choice here
anymore and this is why we can construct
the search tree so that at each level we
determine the assignment of at least two
vertices now just to make this very
clear let me show you this again here in
this example so let's go back one level
when we made the choice here to not put
this vertex into the vertex cover we
could immediately also have said that
this vertex here must be part of the
vertex cover because otherwise this edge
here cannot be covered and we would
already have been done and the same
thing up here so if we decide that this
vertex is not part of the vertex cover
then we immediately know that this
vertex must come into the vertex cover
because otherwise this edge here would
not be covered and we also know because
of this edge here that we have to put
this
vertex here into the vertex cover so we
are also done having found a slightly
larger solution the only thing where we
still need to make a decision is this
part down here there we can still go
into three cases either putting that one
into the vertex cover that one or both
and this is of course something that an
algorithm can do as well so actually we
get down to five assignments here which
already makes this search tree better
than the one we started out with but now
comes the really cool part because once
we know that we can construct the search
tree so that at each level we determine
the assignment of at least two vertices
we can do a pretty pretty cool
worst-case analysis of that search tree
so let me show you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
