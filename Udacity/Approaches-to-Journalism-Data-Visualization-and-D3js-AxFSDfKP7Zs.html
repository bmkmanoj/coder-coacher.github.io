context to our visualization and see how
to create a narrative around our data I
wanted to take a step back and first go
over some approaches traditional
journalism takes when creating its
stories nate silver of blog 538 Fame who
correctly predicted all 50 states in the
2012 presidential election describes
approaches to journalism with the
following spectrum in an opening post of
the new relaunch of his blog Nate sees
journalism as neither wholly
quantitative or qualitative when talking
about approaches to journalism it's not
a binary categorization to him rather
than being either quantitative or
qualitative he sees as more of a
spectrum numbers without context is just
as meaningless as words without numbers
and you need both to create effective
data stories and they actually goes one
step farther and labels each of the
quadrants the upper left is where
organizations like 538 stand that
produce very rigorous and empirical
articles based on some quantitative data
when talking about the upper right
quadrant I'm referring to the
traditional articles that the Washington
Post The New York Times might put out
that have extensive research backing the
qualitative story they're trying to tell
a narrative but may not necessarily
contain charts interactive graphics or
some data collection or experiment
they're testing but as I mentioned
earlier the quantitative and qualitative
divide isn't necessarily as black and
white as I might have drawn it in this
graphic and organizations like the
Washington Post in the New York Times do
have very data-driven articles and
interactive graphics just like 538 I
publish more qualitative articles in
line with traditional journalism the
bottom of this chart the bottom left and
the bottom right quadrants Nate doesn't
think too highly of the reason being
that the bottom half of this graphic
represents anecdotal and ad hoc stories
the bottom left here might represent
sports writers or other journalists who
take numbers and statistics out of
context and don't have the rigorous
research to back them and verify their
facts and finally the bottom right
quadrant is reserved for op-ed columnist
sand pundits who disseminate solely
their opinions without any research data
or hard facts to back up their claims in
this class we will focus on the upper
left quadrant and techniques the
organizations like 538 take when writing
their articles and crafting their
narratives in this lesson we will try to
create a compelling data narrative
around the history of the World Cup
using quantitative facts and data to
support our claims to convey potentially
some qualitative or subjective view of
the world cup but before we go farther I
want to expand on this idea of the upper
left quadrant of quantitative and
rigorous analysis in the context not
only of journalism but how I tied into
data science as a whole</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
