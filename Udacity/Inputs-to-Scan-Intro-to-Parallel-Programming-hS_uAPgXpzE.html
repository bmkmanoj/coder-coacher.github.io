and a binary associative operator as
inputs you may recall that associativity
was useful in reduced to allow us to
reorder operations to expose concurrency
and you'd be right in thinking that
we're going to do the same thing here
for completeness I should note that all
the operators we use in this class are
also commutative X off Y is gives you
the same result as Y off X
implementations turned out to be a
little bit more complex if you don't use
that assumption but we're not going to
cover that here now scan also requires a
third input an identity value associated
with the binary operator so for any
operator op I op a where I is the
identity element and a is any value
always gives you back a for the binary
associative operator addition then the
identity element is 0 because if you add
0 to any value you get back that value
for the binary associative operator
minimum the identity element is the
maximum representative value consider an
unsigned char data type for instance the
identity element there is 0xff because
men of unsigned chars between 0 x FF and
any value a will always give you back a
so a little quiz to make sure we
understand binary associative operators
and their identity elements what are the
identity elements for multiplication for
the logical or operator and for the
logical and operator</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
