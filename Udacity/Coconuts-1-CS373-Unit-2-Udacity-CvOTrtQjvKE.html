are stranded on an island on the island
are many coconut trees with many
coconuts the guys in the monkey spend
all day collecting a huge pile of
coconuts when night falls they are all
very tired except for the monkey in they
all fall asleep after they agreed to
divide the coconuts into five equal
parts the next morning and parts
different ways now in the middle of the
night the first guy wakes up and he
doesn't trust the others so he decides
to take his fifth right now and hide it
but unfortunately the number of coconuts
is not divisible by five however if he
gives one to the monkey then the
remainder is divisible by five so it
takes his fifth and hide is in a safe
place afterwards the guy falls asleep
again the same scene now repeats four
more times for each of the guys the next
guy wakes up realizes that the remaining
number n is still not divisible by five
but if he gives a coconut to the monkey
who now holds two coconuts then the
remainder is divisible by five so he
takes his fifth and hides it in a safe
place and now the guy falls asleep again
the next guy wakes up he gives one
coconut to the monkey which makes it
remain that a visible by five he takes
his fifth and hides it in a safe place
before he falls asleep the monkey now
holds three coconuts the fourth guy
wakes up same story he has to give unto
the monkey he takes his fifth which of
course now is much smaller than the
original fifth and hides it and falls
asleep and finally the fifth guy wakes
up and again the number of coconuts
remaining is not divisible by five but
as he gives one to the monkey the remain
that becomes the visible of five so he
takes his fifth and hides it as a safe
place before he falls asleep again as
the Sun rises all five guys wake up at
the same time
and they all realize the mountain of
coconuts has shrunk substantially but
they can't say anything because each of
them took some away in the middle of the
night so they decided to proceed as
planned but the number of coconuts
surprisingly is not divisible by 5 by
giving one more coconut to the monkey
the remainder is see visible by 5 and
each one takes his fifth and then they
apart their ways leaving the monkey
behind so here's a question how many
coconuts has the monkey well no that's
easy how many coconuts were they
originally</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
