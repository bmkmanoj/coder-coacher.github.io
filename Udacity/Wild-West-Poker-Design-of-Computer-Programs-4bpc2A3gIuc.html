going to assign to this hand by the way
a poker player would call out his hand
when asked to reveal it
so our player declares straight flush
Jack hi that's all you have to know
about the hand a straight flush the
highest ranking and then the tiebreaker
all we have to know is that the jack is
the high card so the number 8 stands for
straight flush and the number 11 stands
for Jack and that completely describes
the hand
here's another hand let's see what what
our player would declare for this hand
four aces and a queen kicker and so four
aces is the major rank which is a seven
an ace is rank card rank number fourteen
and the Queen his card rank number
twelve and so that's the complete
description of the hand
seven fourteen twelve let's do another
one what's this hand so full house
eights over kings so even though a king
is higher than the 8 the 8 is what
counts more importantly because there's
three of them so a full house is a major
ranking number six then the eight
because it's three of them and then the
King which is thirteen that's remaining
card and that three element tuple
completely describes this in here's
another hand how do we declare this one
sorry our player has called flush ten
eight describing the two highest cards
in his hand because that's usually
enough to distinguish the hand from all
other flushes that might be out there
but in actuality we might need all the
hands to break the ties now a flush is
ranked number five and in order to break
the ties we look at all the cards in the
hand highest first and working all the
way down so something in there should be
able to break the tie although it it
certainly is possible although unlikely
that somebody else has those five exact
cards in another suit and then it
actually would be a tie there would be
no tiebreaker
let's look at this in our player
describes a straight Jack I that's all
he needs to say because if it's a
straight if you know jack is the high
card then you know the other cards have
to be 10987 so we only need two numbers
to describe this for meaning straight
and then
eleven meaning Jack next hand three
sevens usually that's enough to
disambiguate a hand but if we really
need to break the ties then we would
look at the next highest ranking card
next the five and then finally the two
so to describe the hand we have the
ranked number four which is 3 then the
7s and then the complete list of the 5
cards next hand 2 pairs jacks and threes
and that describes most of the hand but
we also need to compare all the cards
including the two pairs but it's the
highest ranking pair first so first the
two meaning two pairs then the 11 for
the Jack the highest of the two pairs
then the 3 for the 3s and now we need
the final card and but I happen to have
all the ranks standing around so I use
that as a stand-in for the final card
either way that fifth card can
completely disambiguate the hand if you
happen to tie on the jacks in the trees
here our player declares pair of two's
Jack high that partially describes a
hand notice we've lost the exclamation
point he's not so excited about his hand
this time so a pair of two's that's down
to ranking number one then the pair of
two's is the first tiebreaker and then
all the cards in the hand
our final hand and our poor player
declares I got nothing now he's really
crying
but sometimes nobody else has anything
either and then we still have to decide
among the players who have nothing who
wins and we just go in order of the
ranks of the cards so nothing is 0 and
then the ranks of the cards from highest
to lowest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
