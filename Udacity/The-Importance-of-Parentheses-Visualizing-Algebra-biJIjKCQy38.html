important that we use parentheses I
didn't use parentheses on that last quiz
because I only had two variables and one
operation between them but we should
always use parentheses when replacing
variables here's why here's an
expression of triangles and circles one
thing that wouldn't be careful about is
what's the operation between symbols and
numbers well we assume that there's
multiplication between variables or
symbols and numbers we don't often show
it in algebra but we want to make sure
that we always include that there will
see other examples of this later
throughout the course I'm going to
assign the value of the triangles to be
negative 1 and I'm going to assign the
values of the circles to be three we
want to use parentheses when we replace
variables because of negative signs
here's what it would look like I would
have three times negative 1 because a
triangle is negative 1 then x 3 because
a circle is 3 plus 4 times negative 1
again for the triangle and it's squared
and then x 3 for the circle and on the
end I would have minus negative 1 to the
third here this circle is really an
exponent so I have 3 times negative 1
times 3 which is negative 9 I know
negative 1 squared is negative 1 times
negative 1 negative 1 times negative 1
is just positive 1 so this number
becomes positive one so i have negative
9 then plus and then i have 4 times 1
times 3 which is 12 now on this end part
here i have to do negative 1 cubed first
I know powers come first I've rewritten
the statement over here so now negative
1 cubed is really negative 1 times
negative 1 times negative 1 I know three
negative ones makeup- won the first two
would be positive 1 then I'd make it
negative so i have negative 9 plus 12
subtracting a negative is really adding
a positive negative 9 plus 12 is three
plus one is four when i plug in the
value of negative one for my triangles
and when i plug in the value of three
for the circles i get an answer of four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
