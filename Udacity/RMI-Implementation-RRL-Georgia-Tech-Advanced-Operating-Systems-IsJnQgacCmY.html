object model of Java and how to build
services using the distributed Java
object model and publish it and make it
accessible to the clients let's look at
how the anima is actually implemented at
the core of the ARMA implementation is
this layer called remote reference layer
or RL and that's the place where a lot
of magic happens the client-side stub is
going to initiate a remote method
invocation call using this remote
reference layer and all of the magic was
respect to marshaling the arguments in
order to send it over the network and so
on is handled entirely by this remote
reference layer and similarly when the
result comes back unmarshal
the results into the data structures
that the client understands is once
again accomplished using this RRL layer
on the server side the skeleton that
exists is therefore unmarshal in the
arguments that comes from the client and
in order to unmarshal the arguments the
skeleton uses the remote reference layer
because the remote reference layer knows
how to unmarshal the arguments that are
coming in and the skeleton then makes
the call up to the server that is
implementing the remote object once the
server is done with the service the
skeleton marshals the result and once
again goes through the remote reference
layer to send it over to the client and
when it comes back the remote reference
layer and the stub worked together to
deliver the results in a digestible
format to the client so marshaling an
unwashed link there also called
serializing and deserializing
in the java world marshalling and unn
marshaling are also called serializing
and deserializing
java objects and all of that is being
done by the RL layer so basically the
objects that are being passed as
arguments they are serialized by the RL
and deserialized on the server end and
given to the server and similarly the
result which is also an object is
serialized using the remote reference
layer and when it arrives on the
client-side
it is deserialized and delivered as a
result object back up to the client now
where are the clients and the server's
are they on the same machine or a
different machine of course we are
talking about networked services and so
the server is going to be remote but the
server could have several instances
there could be a single instance of a
server or there could be multiple
instances of the server and the server
may have ability for doing persistence
and so on where is all that magic
happening well similar to the
subcontract layer that we discussed in
the spring system the remote reference
layer is doing all the magic with
respect to where the server is
how the server is handling requests is
it replicated is it a singleton server
all of these things are being handled
through the remote reference layer so
what that means is it allows for various
invocation protocols between the client
and the servers and all of those things
are buried in their remote reference
layer and the actual clients and the
server's can be impervious to those
details so in the Java Runtime stack the
RRA layer is a very crucial layer and it
has functionality is very similar to the
subcontract mechanism in the spring
system and as I mentioned earlier the
Java RMI derives a lot from the
subcontract mechanism and so there is
not much surprised that there are
similarities between the RRL layer and
the subcontract mechanism having
discussed RRL
let's go and talk about the transport
layer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
