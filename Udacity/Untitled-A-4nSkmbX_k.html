nanodegree my name is Chris and I'm
kirkham lead here at Udacity and my name
is Catherine and I'm a developer
advocate at Google there are over 1.4
billion active Android devices today so
becoming an Android developer means
being able to build software that can
reach and impact the lives of tons of
users around the world yeah this is a
pretty incredible time in history
because mobile apps are changing the way
that we live and work so we're super
excited that you're taking the first
step to becoming a developer for this
nanodegree you don't need any
programming experience if you know how
to use a computer in a smartphone you're
ready to go yeah that's right no
programming experience needed so if
you've ever had an awesome idea for an
app but didn't know how to get started
and this is the program for you will
walk you through how to build several
simple Android apps and along the way
you'll learn the java programming
language and also some key computer
science concepts yeah we're going to
focus on what's important and how to
directly apply what you've learned to
the apps you're building it's going to
be challenging and that's expected but
that's why we're going to teach you how
to think like a developer will explain
the decisions that arise when building
an app you'll learn how to read
documentation search for online
resources plan out your tasks and also
figure out how to get unstuck in
signature to every nano to experience
you'll also have the opportunity to
complete projects on your own and get
invaluable feedback on your code and by
the end of the program you'll have
completed a whole portfolio of apps that
you can share with your family and
friends we hope that you become inspired
to learn more and go on to build some
great apps yeah let's go get started do
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
