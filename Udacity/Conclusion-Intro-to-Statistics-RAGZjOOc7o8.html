this it's a big function that has the
highest value at the center 19 and it
falls down in some interesting way that
looks awfully much like the way the
previous exercise fell down so even for
this different experiment with the die
forget about the same phenomena that the
sum of those seems to have a distinct
high probability for what's the most
likely outcome for and then it falls off
in some interesting way so this is
effectively what's called the central
limit theorem and it sounds complicated
in fact it is but here is the simple
version to remember suppose you're doing
many experiments each of these
experiments over here have some
distribution we don't care it has to
just be reasonable and you some those
all up for some very large number n if n
is large then the Joint Distribution of
the sum of those will approach a
function that looks like this that's
called a Gaussian we discussed the
Gaussian in depth it has its own formula
and typically if n is as big as 30 that
is maybe you test 30 people whether they
have cancer or not that's usually good
enough to approximate this really
complicated binomial over here with this
relatively simple Gaussian function if
we learn more about this later the key
thing to remember is you take many
experiments you add them up and out
comes a function just like this that's
called the central limit theorem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
