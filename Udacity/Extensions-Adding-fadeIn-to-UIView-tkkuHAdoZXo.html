to the code that animates of use alpha 2
1 first go into the view controller dot
Swift file and copy this fade in code
next go back to the UI view extensions
file and paste that code into the fade
in function now just like before will
replace imageview alpha with self alpha
whatever view is calling this method is
represented myself and that is the
object we want to fade in the next step
is the same as well we need to pass in
the parameters for duration delay and
completion and then we pass each of
those three parameters to the animate
with duration method last but not least
we need to alter the code in our view
controller to make it simpler now that
we have access to the fade out and fade
in methods from this extension so go
back to the view controller dot Swift
file and we're going to delete this call
to animate with duration everything up
to the completion block let's keep that
instead of calling animate with duration
we're just going to call fade out we'll
call it on the property image view the
fade out method takes in three
parameters duration let's do one second
for that delay we don't want to delay so
we'll put 0 seconds and then the
mysterious completion closure which we
kept there from last time the first part
of the completion closure can stay in
its original form but after the image is
swapped we want to use the method fade
in like we did above with fade out will
delete this animate with duration code
just go ahead and delete the whole thing
and in its place we'll put a call to
self image view da din again we'll put a
duration of one second with no delay
before we put in the completion
parameter let's pause for a second and
look at the method signature that X
codes code completion brings up see how
the type of this completion has a
question mark at the end this closure
has an optional type and it's a good
thing too because in this case we don't
actually want anything in particular to
happen when the fade in method is
finished we want to be able to pass in
nil and it's fine for the completion
closure to be nil because
an optional type okay we want to test
this out but first we should check in
our storyboard file to make sure that
all of our outlets are connected so
let's take a look at the image view ok
that one's connected let's take a look
at the button that one's connected we
should be good to go alright the moment
of truth we'll go up here to run press
the play button okay here's our image in
the simulator and then when we press
next the image fades out and when it
fades back in it's changed from sunrise
to sunset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
