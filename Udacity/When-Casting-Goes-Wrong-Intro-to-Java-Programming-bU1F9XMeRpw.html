crashed in this case I can just add the
condition back compile and run again and
this only cost me a couple of minutes
but if I had been running this program
for a whole day or something and it had
crashed and lost all my data or my
website went down and I had to rush to
my computer and run the program again to
get it up and running I would be pretty
sad if you find yourself casting
something to an interface type and
checking whether things are instances of
other things it's often a sign that you
could design your code better so that
you could make the Java compiler do more
work for you and find errors at compile
time instead of runtime so what could we
have done in this case maybe what we
really wanted instead of a moveable and
a drawable interface with some other
interface like animated may be animated
would have void draw as well as void
move and when House has implemented the
move method they could return
immediately instead of actually moving
that way we could ask all of the
animated elements to move and not worry
about runtime errors or maybe we should
accept that one ArrayList isn't enough
here
maybe we wanted to arraylists one
drawable and one moveable there are lots
of possibilities here finding the best
ones is something that you'll find by
trying more things keep practicing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
