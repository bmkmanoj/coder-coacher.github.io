than what can be provided by all the
variants of Roboto how do you pick an
additional fund well it's pretty hard
choosing the right font isn't only a
technical challenge it's not enough to
just pick a font that's easy to read and
contrasts well with the content around
it your choice of font can impact how
your users perceive your app and how
they emotionally respond to it
handwritten fonts or fonts with rounded
terminals can make your app feel
informal on the other hand very
geometric fonts might give an impression
of order and structure and some fonts
might even feel robotic weight matters
to hear light fonts are those with
really thin serifs can evoke impressions
of elegance but also impermanence
meanwhile ultra bolds might evoke
heaviness but possibly stability and
fonts can even be associated with a time
period while some may have an almost
historic significance others may be
considered a little too trendy there
really aren't great absolute rules for
choosing the right custom font for your
app but here a couple of tips that might
prove handy first limit your font
palette you can often get away with
using just one custom font for branding
areas like your app bar and Roboto for
everything else if you do pick another
sans-serif font to replace Roboto for UI
elements like the text here make sure to
switch over completely so you don't have
to similar looking fonts next to each
other here Helvetica and Roboto are
placed next to each other but since they
look kind of similar it's kind of this
weird you know uncanny valley it's not
clear if it's intentional or not second
try out the font you're thinking of on a
couple different devices with varying
screen densities well it looks awesome
at xxhdpi might look really muddy at
mdpi notice the seraphs and the H are
barely even visible and finally watch
out for unintended cognitive dissonance
and make sure the font fits the mood
you're setting in the app if your
product is all about being
putting a font with a heavyweight on
might give the feeling of a slow
lumbering giant on the other hand if you
have an app that's highly technical and
overly decorative font might not only be
distracting but it might erode your
users trust and what you're trying to do
so does your proposed extra custom font
meet all those requirements great James
is gonna walk you through how to use the
font you just picked in your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
