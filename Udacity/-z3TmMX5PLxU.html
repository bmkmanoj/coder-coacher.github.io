intersection of planes let's start by
assuming we have two planes ax plus B y
plus C Z equals K 1 and DX plus ey + FZ
equals K to where the normal vectors a b
c and d e f aren't parallel given to non
parallel planes i claim their
intersection will be a line instead of a
single point from the picture this may
seem intuitive but how can we show this
fact algebraically in all cases let's
use a tool from the previous lesson the
cross-product consider the cross product
of these two normal vectors n 1 &amp;amp; 2
since the two normal vectors are not
parallel their cross product will not be
0 also remember that n 1 cross n 2 will
be orthogonal to both n 1 and n 2 let's
pick an arbitrary point in the
intersection of the two planes and call
it X 0 if X is any other point in the
intersection then let's call d sub X the
vector from X 0 to X since x 0 and x are
both in the first plane the vector
connecting them d sub X will be
orthogonal to the normal vector to the
first plane and one by similar reasoning
since x 0 and x are both in plane to the
vector connecting them DX will be
orthogonal to and two since D X is
orthogonal to both n1 and n2 and since
we're in three dimensions DX must be
parallel to the cross product of n1 and
n2 since DX is parallel to n1 cross and
two no matter what X we picked that
means the intersection of these two
planes has to be a line that is parallel
to and one cross and two so what are the
consequences of this well if we have a
system of two linear equations in three
dimensions then the set of points
satisfying the system could form a lines
worth of solutions if the equations
define two planes that are not parallel
no solutions if the equations define
different parallel planes or a whole
wayne's worth of solutions if the two
equations define the same plane however
if we introduce a third equation to our
system then we could have another
possibility the common intersection of
the three planes could be a single point
or it could be a line a plane or nothing
at all there are a few important
observations we should make here recall
that one equation in two variables
defines a line or a one dimensional
linear object a single equation in three
dimensional space defines a plane which
is a two dimensional linear object in
general a single equation in some number
of variables will define a linear object
that has a number of dimensions one less
than the number of variables however we
need to be careful to distinguish
between an equation say in two variables
and an equation in say three variables
where one of the variables has a
coefficient of zero in the former case
the equation defines a line in 2d but in
the latter case the equation defines a
plane in 3d being aware of the context
of your problem will help you avoid this
error another observation is that the
coefficients of the variables in a
linear equation give the coordinates for
a normal vector to the linear object it
defines so for the line ax plus B y
equals K we obtain the normal vector a B
and for the plane ax plus B y plus C Z
equals K we have a normal vector of ABC
this trend will continue as we move into
higher dimensions and again this is why
the normal vector is a useful piece of
information for defining a linear object
one last observation is that we need at
least two lines in two variables to
obtain a unique intersection of lines
and we need at least three planes in
three-dimensional space or three
variables to obtain a unique
intersection of the planes this
observation will generalize as we
progress into higher dimensions and in a
little bit we'll see an algebraic reason
why it holds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
