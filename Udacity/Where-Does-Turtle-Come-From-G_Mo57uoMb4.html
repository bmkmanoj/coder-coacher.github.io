I will be providing feedback on the
discussion forums periodically okay so I
now want to talk about how Python knows
about this thing called the turtle well
inside the Python standard library there
is this file called turtle turtle with a
lowercase T and inside that file is
something new and that something new is
called a class a class turtle
with an uppercase T now this is a little
different than what we've seen thus far
what we have done thus far is some sort
of file like a web browser dot some sort
of a function like open but we haven't
seen this thing called a class which
begs the question what is a class for
now you can think of a class as a neatly
packaged box that puts things together
really well and it allows us to write
code like turtle turtle with these
strange-looking brackets as if we were
calling a function in fact when we do
run this piece of code we are in fact
calling a function a function called
init which is defined inside the class
turtle in it stands for initialize and
what it does is it creates space in
memory for a new instance or a new
object of the class turtle this instance
we called Brad Brad can now access all
of the rest of the methods that are
inside class turtle like forward and
right forward makes Brad turn forward
and right makes Brad turn to the right
don't take my word for it let's look for
them in the documentation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
