manipulate Dom nodes programmatically
let's try to change the background color
of the navbar in the udacity player
first we need to find some identifier
for the navbar a shortcut I like to use
to finding which Dom element is
represented by a visual element is to
right-click and select inspect element
this is going to bring me to the navbar
or a portion of the navbar
but if you notice here the selection
doesn't extend the width of the window
which leads me to believe that we've
actually selected a child of the navbar
that we're looking for going up we see a
header tag and when we hover spans the
full width of the window and that has
classes defined on it which might mean
that we can select it by using the d3
select function since the header is
actually a header tag we can be more
specific in our CSS query and look for a
header tag with class navbar static top
what's returned is another one of these
d3 arrays if we open it up we see it's
actually the header element we want and
again hovering over it in the console
highlights it in the window in order to
manipulate the selection d3 defines a
set of transformation functions to
change any of the CSS styling we call
the dot style method on the d3 selection
the first argument of style being the
CSS property we would like to change or
return if we don't pass a second
argument to dot style and many of the
other d3 transformation functions work
the same way
this actually accesses the appropriate
style in this case background color and
returns it to us as you can see here the
d3 syntax says using d3 select a header
with class navbar static top and return
to me the background color styling
defined on the header element as you can
see here it returns a string of RGB
values if we would actually like to
manipulate and change the background
color we simply need to pass a second
argument which will replace the current
background color in this case as a
second argument
I'm simply passing a string
responding to the color I would like to
change the background to in this case
screen two things to note of what just
happened one the bar did indeed change
to green but another strange thing is
that the style method actually returned
to me another array it's the same object
as returned from select corresponding to
the nav bar this is what I mean when I
say D threes chainable API most methods
defined in d3 return whatever object
they were called on in this case d3
select finds and returns a d3 selection
object dot style mutates that object and
then returns the mutated object and so
forth so we can call a somewhat
arbitrary number of functions chaining
one after each other and d3 knows how to
handle it changing at each step of the
chain the object being passed through</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
