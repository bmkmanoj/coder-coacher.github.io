application is so Zaman let me ask you
what is yours my favorite application
would have to be Google now it's a good
choice because I just so it just so
happens I have a screenshot of it right
here so what do you like about it what
is it um well I really love Google now
it's basically an application that
combines all these different data
sources or signals about me and kind of
anticipates the information that I write
that I might need first of all the
visual design is really amazing I think
they really got that right if you look
at the agency meeting card they just
took a lot of information and put it in
a nice glanceable way and it's just
really clean and easy to see cool I
really like the engineering aspect of
this so they took so many different data
sources and put them into one card and
the information is really accurate
another thing that I really like is the
interaction design really in two ways
when I first started using Google now I
didn't have to fill out a lot of forms
or tell it a ton of information about
myself
to get it set up it just started kind of
learning from the way I used it and also
the calls to action or the contextual
actions off the cards are really awesome
there's just a few of them and they're
really useful that's awesome so how
would this have gone wrong for you like
for example in the user interface or
engineering interaction can you give me
examples what happens when they get UI
wrong for example if you were to get the
UI wrong the cards would no longer be
glanceable basically would have to stop
and really study and read them they
would no longer be easy to glanced at
and get information for also if I'm on
the go which is the whole point of this
app that would pretty much make it
useless for me yeah right so what if
they got the engineering wrong if they
cut the engineering wrong basically it
would kind of erode your trust in the
application like if it told me that my
flight was at a certain time tomorrow it
really wasn't then or if that wasn't
even my terminal or gate number you
would kind of never trust the app and
probably stop using it that's true or if
it gave you walking directions to work
that would be really awful yeah that'd
be a very long walk what about this
interaction design thing you talked
about what if they got that wrong I
think it's really crucial how the setup
of Google now works it just starts
presenting cards based on your usage and
asking you whether or not that's useful
information for you so if in it asked me
to fill out you know ten pages of forms
like like when you're going to a new
doctor's appointment and tell it
everything about me
I would have never set it up in the
first place that's true so it sounds
like design is everyone's responsibility
and if everyone does their job in UI
engineering
actually designed and so on then the
user ends up having an awesome
experience with your app yep so let me
ask you this again like who's
responsibility is design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
