deal takes the number of hands and the
number of cards in each hand and then
I've also added in an optional parameter
to make the function a little bit more
general here I built up a normal poker
deck with 13 different ranks and four
different suits
have a list to comprehension that goes
over both of them and makes a 52 card
deck but I provide that as a parameter
because you might want to deal different
types of decks in other games like
pinochle you have a different number of
cards I just want to make deal a little
bit more general so I provide that as an
optional parameter then I randomly
shuffle the deck and you can view looked
up in the random module you see there is
a function called shuffle that's the one
you want and then I go through and for
the number of hands I take a slice out
of the deck which has been shuffled and
accumulate that into the result list now
let's look a little bit more carefully
at exactly what this expression here
means pulling out this slice so I've got
a deck of cards which have been shuffled
so they're not in any particular order
say the three of clubs is first and then
the seven of spades and so on and now I
want to pull out this slice out of the
deck which is defined as the deck
starting at n times I and going up to n
times I plus 1 and we'll assume for now
that N equals 5 when I equals 0 then
this will go from 0 to 5 and we'll pull
out the first 5 cards 1 2 3 4 5 that
slice will be the first element that
we'll pull out now when I is equal to 1
we're dealing to the second player and 5
times 1 is 5 5 times 1 plus 1 is 10 and
we'll pull out the next 5 cards 1 2 3 4
5 and so on we'll keep on going until we
get numb hands different cards and
return them in a list now let's just
make sure this works let's print
and let's just deal out two hands and
there we see we get two hands back there
are two total hands and each of them has
five cards if we wanted to we could deal
different numbers of cards so here we
deal two hands and they each have seven
cards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
