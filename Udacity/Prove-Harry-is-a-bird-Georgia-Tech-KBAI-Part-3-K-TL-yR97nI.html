rules of inferences on sentences in a
knowledge base of a logical agent to
prove all kinds of sentences so imagine
that an AI agent begins with the
knowledge that if an animal has feathers
it implies that the animal is a bird now
it comes across Harry who does have
feathers by modus ponens therefore the
air agent can conclude that Harry is a
bird this completes the proof for our
additional goal of proving that harry's
a bird now let us suppose that the goal
is to prove that buzz does not have
feathers
once again imagine an air agent which
begins with the knowledge that if an
animal has feathers it implies that the
animal has is a bird the agent comes
across a animal which is not a bird then
by modus tollens it can infer that buzz
must not have feathers this completes
the proof for our original goal of
proving that buzz does not have feathers
okay so now we have looked at two ways
of proving the truth value of various
sentences the first way was just two
truth tables I could have sentences and
logic then I could write another
sentence and ask myself well what is the
truth value of this sentence I could
construct a truth table for that
sentence composed of the truth values of
all the predicates which some of which
might be coming from earlier sentences
the second way in which we have seen how
we can prove the truth value of
sentences in logic is by applying this
rules of inferences like modus ponens
and modus tollens this is very powerful
and in fact the power of this logic has
been known since before the birth of AI
as computer scientists however will
analyze this power in a slightly
different way yes we can use the method
of truth tables to construct a truth
table for any arbitrary sentence however
if the sentence was complicated then the
truth table very soon will become very
complex computationally that is
infeasible for very long large sentences
similarly yes we can apply simply modus
ponens and modus tollens to find the
truth value of many sentences but if the
knowledge base consisted of a very large
number of sentences instead of just one
or two sentences did the kinds of
inference with number
influences I can draw from those
sentences simply by applying modus
ponens and modus tollens will be very
large or if I had to find the truth
value of a single sentence then the
different pathways I could take in order
to get to the truth value those
sentences can make for a long large
problem space
so while these methods are proving the
truth value of sentences in logic have
been around for a long time these
methods are not computationally feasible
at least not for complex tasks at least
not for ages that have only limited
computational resources and from whom we
want near real-time performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
