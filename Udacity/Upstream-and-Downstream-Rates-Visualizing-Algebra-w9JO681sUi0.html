and upstream to help us solve a motion
problem with a current we know that if
we travel downstream will not be
traveling faster since we'll be going
with the current but if we travel
upstream will have to be going slower
since we're going against it let's see
if we can solve this first motion
problem together you take a boat
upstream for 10 miles and then back down
for 15 miles if the speed of the current
in the river is five miles per hour and
you make the entire trip in one hour
let's see if you can find the speed of
the boat in still water just like all
the motion problems we've encountered up
until this point we want to use a table
to help us organize all this information
so here's my table and we'll have the
distance for the boat upstream its rate
and it's time and the distance of the
boat downstream with that rate and that
corresponding time as well we want to
find the speed of the boat in still
water so let's make that be our variable
X is going to be the speed of our boat
in miles per hour so now that we have a
variable what expression can you write
for the rate are the speed of the boat
moving upstream and the speed of the
boat moving downstream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
