lead the attack against these bugs is
everyone ready crazy Bob I am ready sir
fight me did you go trial but does ready
to roll dr. bug I was born ready all
excellent we're already here so let us
start if I could interject something
before we begin I just would like to say
before we started this project I uh I
advise management that we wouldn't be
having a lot of these Co problems we've
got now if we just use data you know Ron
Java ada would really you know it would
solve a lot of our integration problems
in all and I just wanted to make that
clear that I told them before we began
this project we should do a dye and here
we are looking at job so I just wanted
to make that clear before we got started
well I mean with that just trying to
read this baloney code this guy wrote is
unbearable well I think we should tell
me proceed with the review promo
gentlemen Riza mind you that I'm the
controller hair thank you very much for
your advice be a reader doctor but
please stop we start with two imports in
the code the first one is a an important
to the java io package all the classes
in the package and there was the right
semi column right after that and there's
another important which is to java lanja
system which is used for the i/o and
another semi column so this looks fine
so like one line one is actually not
good coding style because you should
never import you're polluting the
namespace so we should never import
asterisk we should only import the
classes that were actually using well I
think it's okay though right if we need
to use multiple once said you want to
spell them all out within your polluting
you're bringing in all these names that
we don't really need so I think it
should be what job and I think the only
io class let's see inputstreamreader so
we should have job at the IO
inputstreamreader bacon you're you're
wasting space by doing this
it's just why is it there and thanks for
telling about the semicolons that's a
big help yeah I figured can I continue
as bees continue so we should I record
that as a defector are we don't believe
it's a defect I think it should not
personally I got it I got a echo crazy
Bob here because we move to the next
line purpose we have the the slash star
here for common style and then further
on down we're going to use the slash
slash some consistency would be nice so
I think we should record that is an
error let's move on head start sure okay
crazy Bob we recorded dr. bug okay fine
okay then the the main class starts
which is you that let me let me complain
about line two I don't believe you have
to import anything from java.lang right
I leave Jah the line comes in
automatically I believe that should I
restless that's a useless import okay
fine me that's what my mentor told me
that was supposed to do it okay okay so
then I was that with the main class
maybe we should reconcile this common
issue before we move on that's right out
I think I like me I mean that that's
just don't you have coding standards and
which would include how to write
comments and your I do and it's usually
just stick with one and then that's the
way it goes for the rest of it the
comment the slash star has so much
history with it no we want we want to
reflect the fact that this is a
historical artifact I don't know if I
agree I I think not only that i'm not
sure what constitutes getting its own
white space like an extra line here when
we move down further maybe we come back
to this but i have a couple places at a
mark that I just don't quite understand
what they can build on what might me is
saying it's full one now to come back to
this talked about these continue thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
