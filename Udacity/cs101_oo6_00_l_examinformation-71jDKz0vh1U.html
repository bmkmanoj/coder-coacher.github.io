what questions do we have so our first
question comes from student mark c yes
for details on the final exam that's
coming up when will be what kind of
questions will cover what content
doesn't cover it guys so I'm sure marks
not the only one with questions about
the final and the final will be out next
week and it will be do a little earlier
than the homework so it will be due on
Sunday pay attention to email when the
actual due time is and make sure that
you understand what that means in your
time zone the format of the file will be
similar to the homeworks they'll be
eight questions in the regular part of
the final they'll also be a separate
start questions with some very
challenging problems in order to get a
certificate of accomplishment in the
class you don't have to do any of the
start problems if you can do the
problems in the regular part of the
final that will be enough to convince us
that you've really got a lot of the
class and learned that the most
important things that we want if you
want to really impress us and are up for
a bigger challenge the start part of the
final we'll have some some more
challenging questions for that and we
expect there will be eight questions on
the final it should be similar to what
you've had in the homeworks except for
will cover the whole course not just
focusing on the last unit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
