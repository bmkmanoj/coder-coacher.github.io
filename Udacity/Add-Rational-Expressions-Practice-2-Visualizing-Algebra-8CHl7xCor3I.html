if you found it we start by finding the
lowest common denominator which means we
have to factor this denominator and this
one first factors of 24 that some de
positive 10 are positive 6 and positive
4 while the factors of negative 12 that
sum to positive 1 are positive 4 and
negative 3 this means that our lowest
common denominator would be y plus 6
times y plus 4 times y minus 3 next we
multiply each fraction by the missing
factors of our lowest common denominator
for the first denominator it's missing
the factor Y minus 3 so we multiply the
numerator and denominator by Y minus 3
since we're really just multiplying by 1
for the second fraction we need to x y
plus 6 divided by y plus 6 when we
multiply each of these fractions by a
form of one we get to New equivalent
fractions we multiply these two
numerators together or these two
binomials together to get Y squared
minus 6y plus 9 and then here again we
multiply these two binomials together to
get y squared plus 12y plus 36 we
multiply these out since we're adding
our numerators in the end the
denominators however we can just leave
in factored form since these won't
change when we add the like terms of our
numerators together we get 2y squared
from one y squared + 1 y squared we get
positive 6 Y from negative 6y and
positive 12 y and we get 45 from
positive 9 and positive 36 and finally
we want to check to see if this is
factorable to see if we cancel a factor
in the numerator and denominator we find
factors of 90 that sum to positive 6
when I look at the positive factors of
90 these are the factor pairs none of
these add to positive 6 so I know this
numerator is not factorable since we
can't factor this numerator we actually
have our final answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
