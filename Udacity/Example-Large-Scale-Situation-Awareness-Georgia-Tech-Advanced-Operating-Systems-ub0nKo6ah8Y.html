awareness application would be
monitoring for instance activities in an
airport and in that situation what we
are trying to make sure is that normal
activities are okay but anything that is
anomalous with respect to what we see in
the environment has to result in
triggers being sent to the appropriate
software agents or even humans in terms
of actions that they may need to take
and camera networks are becoming
ubiquitous for instance in the City of
London there is on the order of 400,000
cameras that are deployed blanketing the
city and the intent in such camera
networks is to analyze the camera
streams to to detect for anomalous
situations when you have such a large
number of sensors the first thing that
one has to worry about is overloading
the infrastructure itself with the
amount of data that is being
continuously produced 24-7 from all of
these senses that suggests that it is
important to prune these sensor streams
at the source in order to make sure that
the infrastructure overload is avoided
and the traditional way to do
surveillance is to have humans sitting
in front of banks of monitors looking
for any anomalous activity for instance
in an airport this obviously does not
scale if you have on the order of
100,000 or 200,000 cameras blanketing a
city which is becoming fairly common in
many large cities like New York Chicago
London and so on and so cognitive
overhead is another big thing that you
have to worry about in large scale
situation awareness applications and it
is extremely important to avoid false
positives and false negatives where
false positives we are identifying
events that are not really anomalous but
the system thinks that it is an
anomalous event that's a false positive
and similarly false negative
is saying well there is an event that
took place that should have been caught
but did not get caught and that's a
false negative so both of these are very
very important metrics that one has to
measure in large scale situation
awareness applications from a
programming model perspective one of the
important takeaways in just this
discussion about large-scale situation
awareness application is that the
programming infrastructure has to
facilitate the domain expert who is
developing a large-scale situation
awareness application to be able to deal
with time sensitive data so what are the
pain points and developing large-scale
situation awareness applications the
first thing is providing the right level
of abstractions promoting ease of use
simplicity is the key interfaces that
allow seamless migration of computation
between the edge of the network and the
computational resources in a data center
for instance temporal ordering of events
that are taking place in the distributed
system and propagating temporal
causality by that what I mean is if an
event let's say was captured by a camera
at a particular point of time it may be
processed at a later point of time in
real time but there's got to be a
temporal causality for the time at which
it was captured and the digest of
information that was created and such
temporal causality is extremely
important in the development of
large-scale situation awareness
applications another requirement in such
large-scale situation awareness
application is that there are live data
that we are dealing with but at the same
time we may also have to correlate that
with historical data in order to make a
high level inference as to what's going
on for instance if we see a speeding car
at this point of time on the highway we
may want to ask the question was this
car involved in an incident in the last
10 days and that is
kind of historical data that has to be
correlated with live data so a
programming infrastructure that provides
facility for these kinds of things would
make the life of the domain expert
writing such large-scale situation
awareness applications so much simpler</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
