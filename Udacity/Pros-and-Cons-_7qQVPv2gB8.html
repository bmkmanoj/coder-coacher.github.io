is applied to segmentation it's a it's a
I will tell you it's a very strong
technique the cool thing is it
automatically finds these basins of
attractions so you don't have to tell it
how many modes there are and you just
tell it in fact there's one parameter
choice essentially which is that window
size how big that Gaussian is there's
also when you talk about that because
you're operating in a feature space you
actually have a distance function right
because when my Gaussian is over some
distance so if I want to scale color
more than texture Oh texture we haven't
talked about that yet all right we'll do
that next or color more than luminance
you make that decision ahead of time so
there's this parameter choice of window
size but there's also a general distance
metric function choice but you have that
in every sort of clustering that you do
it doesn't make any assumptions about
the shape of the the segments in the
image of the cluster in the image it
just does this in the district
probability distribution of the pixels
and it's a very generic technique for
finding multiple modes and people use
mean shift for a variety of things like
tracking when we actually talked about
doing that previously you know as in
anything else there are some downsides
it does depend on this window size and
sometimes figuring out that window size
is a bit of an art with respect to the
nature of the set of the images that
you're looking at and the other problem
is because you are sort of moving in
feature space oh and and you want to
make sure that you get a reasonable
number of points within your your region
of interest in order to shift for the
mean well suppose you've got a big
feature space right and what I mean by
that is you've got 50 dimensions
well almost by definition your feature
space will be sparse right because the
sort of the number of little if you if
you let's suppose you carved up every
dimension into like 10 buckets well if
there's 50 dimensions right that's ten
to the fiftieth buckets so by definition
there's going to be very lots and lots
of buckets that have hardly any points
in them so mean shift needs you to have
a reasonable number of points within
that region so it doesn't work as well
in high dimensions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
