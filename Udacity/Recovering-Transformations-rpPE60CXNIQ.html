the question what can we do about trying
to now be able to recover
transformations from images so basically
what that means for recovering is given
F and X Y can i generate gxy but also
can I also kind of learn the
transformation itself so it basically
means is given an image F and given the
transformed image if I know the axes for
both of them this would be X and Y and
of course this would be X prime Y prime
if we know what F and G are can we
recover the transformation T itself to
achieve this one question would be is
how many points on both these images do
I need to know for example would I need
to know a point here that would
correspond to this point here I would
need a point here that would need to
correspond to this point here I will
need to know this point corresponding to
this and this point corresponding to
this all right so if I know these
correspondences I would be able to
figure out the inverse but or this
transformation function but how many do
I need to know is the question do I also
need to know some insight those are
important questions let's get to that
and we would do this in forms of quizzes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
