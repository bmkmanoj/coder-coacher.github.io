twice once for countries and then for
cars and you probably passionately wish
to never again have to do that for any
other class so let's see how we can come
up with a generic way of computing
averages the trouble was that the cars
and countries had different ways of
measuring whatever it is that they
wanted to be measured by by with the car
was the fuel efficiency with the country
it was the area but let's say they're
both agreed on what it meant for them to
be measured let's say they're both
implemented a common interface I call
this interface measurable let's look
inside it just has a single method get'
measure we expect each class that
implements this interface to provide an
appropriate implementation for get
measure for example the country class
implements get measure to return the
area the core class has the same method
return miles per gallon now we can
implement a single method in the data
class that will take an array of
measurable objects and it will compute
the average measure that's for you to
complete in the tester we'll call this
method first on an array of countries
then we call the same method again on an
array of cars that's what I mean with
reuse this method only has to be written
once and we can call it with datasets
containing objects of different classes
now go ahead and complete the
implementation of the average method</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
