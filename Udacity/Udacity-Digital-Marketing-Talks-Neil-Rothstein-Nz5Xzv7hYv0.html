fireside chat today I'm joined by Neil
Rothstein Neil is a marketing executive
and consultant he has headed up
marketing for 23andme for several years
and before that Neil headed up online
marketing for Netflix but Neil maybe you
can tell us a little bit about
yourselves yeah sure thank you for
having me so I was at 23 me for four and
a half years but left there at the end
of January and so since then I've been
working as a marketing consultant
working with startups trying to help
them drive growth and scale their
businesses and so it was that brought
onto 23andme in September of 2012 - I
was a first executive marketing hire
there even though the company had been
around for six or seven years before
that and really the focus for the
company up until then had been on
building the scientific credibility
within the biotech in genetics space and
so I was brought on to build out a team
drive growth build a consumer brand and
so I did that when I left I had been
head of all of marketing so I was
consumer marketing commercial marketing
and customer care as well and then
before that had a had a great experience
at Netflix I was there for 11 years I
think what's kind of the common string
between the two of them is really that
I've joined companies that are kind of
an inflection point and then been there
as we've driven a lot of growth so with
23andme when I started with about
170,000 customers when I left about 2
million with Netflix 300,000 DVD only
subscribers and when I left in the
United States only in them when I left
we had 30 million across you know 30 or
so countries DVD and streaming
subscribers Hausa both really super fast
yeah I mean it was I mean you kind of
look back now so wow that's it's it's
pretty incredible where they are buddies
kind of as you go through and it's lots
of roller coasters as that's going on
tell us a little bit how you got started
in marketing like marketing how did that
happen yeah I mean just probably typical
route that everybody takes I was on Wall
Street for a couple of years and then
and then went to back to school because
I wanted to transition and work in
sports and so I went to business school
down in Atlanta at Emory Business School
worked for the Atlanta organized
in committee for the Olympics as a
financial analyst then after that that
was through 1996 and then was really
looking for that next step I'm
originally from back east so up north in
the Northeast New Jersey and so then
worked at ESPN for two and half years
again as a financial analyst but I think
one of the things I struggled with with
with the ESPN was I really didn't feel
like I was making a big impact it was
just kind of a small person and like
this company that you know Sports Center
was gonna happen whether I was part of
it or not and so really wasn't something
that that got me got me excited even
though I was in this industry that I
that I loved and was passionate about
and so I was I started doing some
part-time work with friends on a
start-up they were working on and then
decided to move out here to join them
these were friends from business schools
and you know it was 2000 and everyone
was was making their way out here all
that was the kind of the that was April
of 2000 I was came out here and then the
market kind of crashed a little bit
after that and the middle class and I
kind of transitioned out of doing
finance I was doing much more business
development it was a online reviews
website that was trying to help other
companies add opinion sharing technology
to their websites after that I was you
ran out of money I was teaching GMAT
prep for Princeton Review three of us
moved in together it's like a
three-bedroom apartment over north part
of Golden Gate Park I was like okay I
need to get a job I'd probably a good
idea you can start making some money and
so I was applying for a job just trying
to find fine things and I a friend of
Mike a friend of a friend worked at
enough flex like my wife's like
seasoning my my sister's good friend
from college worked at Netflix and she
told me about a position there and so I
applied like my and another you know was
they were hiring two people and I got
hundreds of resumes off Craigslist and I
kind of got the job right and I think
what I what was what appealed to them
about me was my data-driven background
so being a financial analyst even though
I didn't have a tremendous amount of
marketing experience I did have that
data-driven experience but you know I
did I had just got a DVD player because
again we were like we just said Netflix
was a DVD only service then DVDs were
still very new this was September of
2001 I had just gotten a DVD player
probably a year
or so earlier and I didn't not that I
thought this was gonna be anything big
but I knew that there were really smart
people that were working there and so I
said well these are people that are
really smart they believe in and I'll do
it and it's worth the hour and 20 minute
commute that I'm gonna have to make from
the city down to Los Gatos I see but
then and then you started in what was a
traditional marketing role right yeah it
was online marketing manager like it was
yes and I think what Netflix really
benefited from at the time was I mean
this was a time that was I mean the
market was was crashing and I mean
there's a first sort of maybe I'm the
first but one of the thought busts that
we've had and over the years since we've
been here and so all of the the online
ad market really began to crater and so
Netflix was was able to leverage that
and there was this time where DVD
players were the fastest-growing
consumer electronics device in history
online ad rates were lower and Netflix
was able to take was able to leverage
that to do lots of cpa deals where we
were paying Microsoft and AOL and Yahoo
for on a CPA basis where we deliver a
subscriber we'd pay them X dollars for
every subscriber every free trial
subscriber that they delivered I see I
see and then but then you were also
there when they made a transition to
stream yes yeah in January almost
exactly yes now it's ten and a half
years ago January of 2007 when we
transitioned to to streaming and that
was also in blockbuster was if you guys
remember a blockbuster the your students
but that was a place used to go to to
have to go in and rent a video VHS tape
or DVD so they were coming at us really
strong at that point in time and so we
and we transition some of our marketing
to to be focused on streaming but that
was it was really a difficult challenge
because given the nature of windowing
and how movies are released like there
were new releases while they're all
available on DVD they were not available
on streaming and so and that's not
something that consumers easily
understood so that was a challenge as we
kind of went through it's like how do we
communicate to them that you don't get
all of the new releases and so but it
was it was it was a wonderful fun
to be there yeah and when you look back
on it now so when you think about comes
about tumbling into digital marketing do
you look back on it fondly and do you
think like hey digital marketing is
really ultimately appeal to me yeah I
mean I like it was I was reading back to
one of my old reviews that like we had
this self-assessment yeah the last like
year me probably more like last year so
I would happen to be reading back to one
of my early self assessments that I had
done and this was I had probably been at
Netflix for a year or whatever and I
what I kind of said at the time was like
this is I kind of think I found like the
perfect job for me right because I had
always had I was an analytical person
data-driven person math has always been
a strong suit of mine but within this
role it also was able to kind of
leverage the interpersonal communication
pieces as well because it wasn't all
just kind of having my head buried in a
spreadsheet it was also at that time
especially for me it was developing
relationships with the ad sales people
at AOL and and and Microsoft and and all
these other companies and and developing
those relationships and complementing
that with my analytic skills usually I
think was what helped me be really
successful and Netflix helped Netflix be
successful and help me continue to grow
yeah I imagine and would you say so it
on a day to day to day basis where you
could have more busy with numbers would
you say or was it or more on the content
in communication side or a bit of a mix
I mean it was a bit of a mixed mean it
was it was this was a different time
right like there wasn't like there were
ad networks not programmatic advi--
search barely you know I started I
really didn't even exist paid search so
much right I mean Yahoo was not a paid
search engine it was a directory right
like it was and they had paid inclusion
and things like that there was a much
different time and so I think there was
there was a healthy balance between
developing the relationships and what
those could be and then also spending
time and
with the numbers because I think you
know what we kind of saw was I mean I
remember AOL was a like I've mentioned a
few times but they were a huge publisher
at the time they were they were they
were super important to work with them
and I developed this great relationship
with with a person there who really
pushed and it was helpful and great
partner to me and kind of and we were
there first CPA partner and he ended up
signing this assigning this big deal
with them that was for a ton of wealth
was called their welcome screen or their
home page placements that were that
became high demand among many other
advertisers as well but we had locked
them all up because we had shown that
they were effective from a testing
perspective we saw that they drove the
ROI that we needed to and then we had
had this relationship I see very cool
yeah and then about Netflix got into
streaming and then later on also into
original content yes
and I think that's one of those when you
think about TV for instance or the cable
industry they had their kind of set
approach to creating a hit using
lead-ins on cable and kind of having a
way to promote shows that were
up-and-coming now for Netflix that was
very different and it seems like that
would have been a challenge for a
marketing for in a few can you tell us a
little bit more about that yeah I can so
I left Netflix in August of 2012 and so
that was right when house of cards was
was just being filmed and so I left
before they kind of a big launch of
these programs well I think there's the
there's a few things that's kind of as a
relates to how Netflix was different and
commitment I guess continues to be
different at the time from from
traditional broadcasters right so
Netflix when they launched house of
cards had let's say 40 or 50 million
subscribers already in place that they
could market this content and I think at
first the wood the originals was much
more about providing were marketed to
existing subscribers and it wasn't
necessarily used at first as a customer
acquisition strategy but I think in mind
in the strategy all along was that that
would evolve over time at one point was
like how can house of cards enhance the
Netflix brand and now it's like the
house of cards brand and the orange is
the new black brand brand and stranger
things and all these things have their
own
really strong brands and they kind of
then feed off the Netflix brand and it's
kind of has this strong interaction that
way I think and then the other piece is
you know Netflix became this great
marketing tool for the for the studios
and shows so things so its seasons like
Mad Men and Breaking Bad subsequent
seasons premiered to much higher numbers
than theirs earlier seasons because
those those programs were available on
Netflix their earlier seasons and so it
kind of helped build up this audience
that didn't exist before hand and so you
know if you have three friends that are
talking about it and say oh they know
the new season of Breaking Bad coming
out next month he was like what Breaking
Bad what they say and then they would
and they would go to Netflix to watch it
and then they would then be a new new
viewer on yeah
very interesting so and then and then
you moved on to our 23andme
yeah everyone natural transition for
movies and TV shows to personal genetics
right yeah so maybe actually well it for
for our students it might be worth
explaining about 23andme does yeah yes
it is different yeah so 23 ma is a
personal genetic service where you you
spin in a test in a little sort of tube
yeah you send back your DNA your saliva
to 23andme in their labs and they then
through your DNA you can learn really
lots of interesting information about
your ancestry and your health so you can
learn from an ancestry perspective you
can learn where your ancestors are from
so your ancestry composition what
percentages you are from different parts
of the world you can connect with DNA
relatives so if you're interested in
that and then from a health perspective
you can and there's a point I'm worth
where some things were available and
some things weren't just because of
regulatory issues but you can learn
about you are whether you are a carrier
for certain inherited conditions like
cystic fibrosis and that's really
important if you're looking to plan a
family you and your part if you or
you're a carrier and your partner's a
carrier that a 25% chance that your
child would be born with that that
condition that you can also learn things
about whether you are a carrier for
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and that
these aren't necessarily things that
doesn't necessarily mean you are going
to get these
diseases but it just means that your
likelihood of getting them could be
higher and then you also can learn some
really interesting things about caffeine
metabolism or whether you're like muscle
composition and so and and others and
then traits about eye color as well I
see very interesting i I'm imagining
from a marketer it's a challenge right
because it's a new lots of completely
new products that 23andme put out in the
market it's been there now for a while
but you were there early on so how did
you approach that challenge yeah
category know it that's exactly right
it's not only we were trying to build a
brand we were trying to build a category
as well and it's and it's a high
consideration product and expense
expense right so high consideration both
from a price perspective so it's at the
time when when I went there was 20 or 99
dollars went down to 99 then back up to
199 so it's even at $99 for four for
most people that's that's a lot of money
it's a high consideration product but
then also you're gonna learn information
that you know we kind of say it's like
you can't unnotice information and some
of it is you know fun and and not not so
intense but some of it is can be
information that's that's difficult to
comprehend whether it's from a health
perspective or even you know there are
stories about people finding out that
they are that their parent that their
mom was adopted or that they like where
they thought there was their father
something like there's lots of
information you can find out so it's a
high consideration product in that way
and so I think what we really needed to
and and in the current landscape of
having to deal with it within a
regulatory yeah yeah I accept clone yes
so there's I think everything in a lot
of ways starts from that regulatory
perspective because you have to kind of
know what you can say and what you can't
say yeah because and that's and because
you don't want to run afoul of that and
you know a lot of that stuff fortunately
is is just being truth and advertising
and things that would that you don't
mean as a marketer you want you don't
want to say say these things anyway
right because you want to be truthful
and honest and
and those sorts of things I think that's
that's still that's definitely the case
but it kind of gets down to regulatory
piece and also a 23 we also have this
had a CEO who was this high-profile
woman who's who had a brand unto herself
and so managing those two things was was
important as well but she also enabled
us and she's so inspirational and such
and so passionate and she was able to
get us a profile that we otherwise might
not get yeah exactly yeah and would you
say no when you look at the balance in
marketing like between traditional and
digital marketing what has 23 Amiel
relied on the most that was an
interesting transition and and learning
for me when I went to 23andme right it's
and I think what I really learned is the
it was gonna be challenging for us to
build our brand solely on the back of
digital advertising and people talk
about how TVs dead and it's an old
medium you know it's still for least
found it to be effective for us in an
important part of the marketing mix it
was a valuable way for us to build our
brand raise awareness I mean if you mean
if you look at marketing as I'm sure in
your courses you talk about like as a
marketing funnel right like a top of the
funnel you really need to drive
awareness and a valuable way to drive
awareness is still through TV and so we
and so through TV and radio sirius
satellite radio we founded those to be
effective mediums for us to do it but
then I mean you really need to have that
that can't be all that you do obviously
you need to have that layered at the
bottom of that it's all the kind of
demand capturing channels that you have
around search and retargeting and and
programmatic and things that really are
kind of doing that fine targeting but
you because you really want to make sure
you leverage all those all the people
that are coming to your website and get
them to convert now and when you when
you look back on their time at Netflix
and then your time at 23andme what are
kind of the biggest challenges you feel
you could have faced in your career as a
what has been the hardest to overcome
and how did you deal with it was I kind
of one of the things that both Netflix
in 23 maybe we kind of touched on a
little bit it's like you look back and
you see where they are right now but you
don't want to see those challenges that
you that we went through at 23andme 14
months after I started we got a letter
from the FDA saying that we couldn't
offer health reports in November 22nd
2013 on my 10th anniversary we get this
we get this warning letter and so so
that creates some serious challenges we
had this we had a strong marketing
capably were driving growth all those
sorts of things so we really needed to I
think what would add what we needed to
try and do is we needed to figure out
how can we continue to build on the
brand and in a in a way that when we're
not offering a large chunk of our
product what we had really positioned
ourselves around how do we kind of
evolved that how do we do it in a way
that's also differentiated from
ancestry.com how do we do it in a way
that's that we can do it costs
effectively and how do you kind of and
we had a whole team of people who were
who were all kind of like shell-shocked
that we were that's lettering so that's
really that was a challenge I think that
really the way what you need to do in
the face of all those things is you can
need to remind people that there are
gonna be ups and downs and you know I
think one of the things that we were we
set the tone early on as an exec team
and certainly and did this is like we're
in this for the long haul we were not in
this to kind of just come in and come
out and it's really we're gonna be in
this long we're gonna and we're gonna
figure it out and I think we brought on
you know where's where the focus se had
been on marketing and we built out a
team like then we came to focus on okay
we got to build out a regularly a strong
legal and regulatory team to Canada that
has experience working with the FDA and
really bringing in function functional
area experts to do those sorts of things
is it's really valuable and critical nd
nd we first that yeah they say they mean
it's pretty remarkable the progress that
has made FDA points to 23andme as an
example of a company they can work with
in the valley to drive it
and so it's really it's remarkable that
the progress that's been made and then
the team over there's done a really
great job and doing that yeah amazing
and and the fact that we know about it
means that the word right so when you
think of your time as a marketer are
there particular kind of mistakes you
feel you made or things you learned
lessons that you're drawing from this
yeah I think just a couple of a couple
of things I kind of think back to that I
always point to as when I was young back
as a marketer just in first jobs I think
one of the things when I was first
started at Netflix we were trying to do
this deal with AOL and at that point in
time they had a ton of clout in the
space seemingly all the leverage or so I
thought at the time and they had done
all the lots of deals that were very Pro
a well and I remember we had gone back
and forth about like what sort of
reporting we were to give to each one
like and this was you know a lot of this
it wasn't as as trains but things
weren't as transparent as they are now
when they were as as available online
and so we had we had both agreed that we
were gonna provide certain level of
detail and then they at the last minute
which was kind of their typical of their
strategy negotiating strides they then
said well we're not going to do that I
kind of got all in a panic about what
we're gonna do and I went and I talked
to our - Leslie Kilgore who's you know
was the longtime CMO of Netflix and
woman that I learned a tremendous amount
from and she really impressed on me like
that
okay well if they're not gonna if
they're gonna do that then we're gonna
do this we're not gonna give it to them
either it's like well how can you do
that like they're a well I'm really kind
of a from her perspective like it was
always about what we were gonna do it
was best for Netflix and if and if they
kind of then walked away they're like
okay well then we're gonna walk away
we're gonna be fine and we're gonna go
and do what always gonna do what's best
in Netflix best interest and that really
always stuck with me in terms of you
need to do what's in your company's best
interests and not to compromise those
those sorts of those sorts of things
yeah even if the other party is very
important exactly like you know you mean
they're always gonna be some trade-offs
and you know and I think but I think
really that was an important lesson
another one I learned this was even
earlier and my career
when I showed up it was at the Olympics
I showed up at a meeting with a senior
executive there and I kind of came in
just like this with you know although in
a suit because back then we were sued
yeah yeah and so I walk in with I mean
he and the first thing he said was like
whenever you come to a meeting always
come with a pen and paper right like
don't like this is before people had
laptops or tablets or smartphones yeah
you can always come with a pen and paper
because you just never know what you're
gonna have to write down if there's
gonna be something going on it kind of
like and that really was the lesson I
was talking about that's just like
always come prepared these are the
meetings that you're gonna be attending
and it's I mean it's a preparation can
take the form of of making sure you know
the subjects inside out if you're if
you're running the meeting certainly
sending an agenda inviting the right
people not making sure that the people
right that if someone isn't gonna be in
a value add to the meeting making sure
they're not part of it but then also is
like basic as making sure you have a pen
and paper to take notes for the meeting
and so those are two things that have
always kind of stuck with me yeah but I
think they're good lessons those for our
students yeah yeah one thing we could
have tell our students and one of the
things that you'd ask is really big on
this we we feel that learning is never
done right learning is a lifelong thing
so when you think about lifelong
learning for yourself are there
particular areas that you're still kind
of you feel like you're you're learning
more on or things that you try to
explore or you want to learn more about
and do you could have applied that to
your own career yeah I think I mean what
I continue to focus for a while the SV
OD subscription video on-demand space
still really interests me it's against
and exciting space I mean the landscape
completely changing there something like
keep an eye on and watch and then
interested in it as a consumer myself I
think the other thing kind of getting
back to my sports roots I follow what's
going on in sports media Milad and so
been with all the rights holders and how
those are changing how things are moving
to online and Amazon showing Thursday
Night Football games and Twitter doing
it last year and and Yahoo doing
everything's like so all those sorts of
things have been
are interesting to me then and then just
how the newspaper and sports writing
industry is changing and you know a new
startup called the athletic that's a
subscription-based writing
subscription-based newspaper I guess
online or without any advertising that's
I think it's those sorts of things
really interests me so I'm working as a
marketing consultant now it's been nice
just kind of having time to just reflect
on lots of those things but then also
spend time with the family again after
running really fast for 15 years yeah I
imagine so would you have any kind of
last word of advice to our students who
are kind of getting into their marketing
careers because they're at the start of
it any word of advice he would give them
kind of looking back on your own yeah I
think I would say a few things one don't
plan too far ahead in a lot of ways
right like so I went back to school to
work in sports and you know ended up at
as the head of marketing for a personal
genetics company right so it's like it's
so things can evolve and change and and
don't be so focused on where where
you're gonna end up be more focused on
kind of what's in front of you don't be
as focused on like okay you're gonna
what's my pagon am am I gonna be making
that extra three thousand dollars or
five thousand dollars or I want to I
want to get at this title really for me
I was always much more focused on on
what I was going to learn and I so I
worked at the Olympics but I I was an
unpaid intern there in between my first
and second year of Business School I
took a job there making probably far
less than most of my other fellow
graduates did because as much for me it
was about getting into into sports and
that was really what was important to me
so I think that's the one thing I would
say so the other thing I would say is
the if you're as you're trying to get
involved in digital or marketing or
whatever is the importance of kind of
becoming a functional area expert for
one particular area as opposed to being
so focused on being a generalist at
first I mean as a hiring manager I
always was I felt like was important to
hire someone who was the expert at say
paid search rather than and and they
could then grow into the generalist and
do other things as opposed to bringing
on someone who was the general that's
because you're with your high
you want someone that can kind of come
in and do that job right away and for me
I was everyone that I hired was better
at what at that role than I was that was
super super important value helped me
yeah
well that's I think that's great advice
so Emil thank you so much for coming and
