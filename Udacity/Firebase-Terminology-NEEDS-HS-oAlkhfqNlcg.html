reading data from the firebase the
firebase yeah the firebase database you
know maybe we should all sync on what
terminology we're going to use
especially since the developer is just
starting us it'd be good to get our
language a bit more straightened out I
was just talking with some of the
firebase engineers in the office about
let me go over the terminology that they
suggested the entire JSON object is but
will referred to as the firebase
database which is part of the firebase
app back end these here are known as
keys and their associated on the right
with values I can also call specific key
value pair a node a key value pair that
represents a key in all the data and an
analogous Java object I might also refer
to as an object if the key value pair
has a bunch of objects inside it such as
this dodge coin key I might call it
interchangeably a list map or a
collection if the key holds a single
value I will refer to it as a property
of a node each node besides the root
node has a single parent for example the
parent of this bid node is litecoin
nodes can also have zero or more
children the children of light coin our
credits updated ask bid and last each
node is set to have a location also
called a database location which is
identified by its URL this is the root
node is at the root URL well great that
works for me all right so why don't you
need actually talk about how to read
data from the firebase database</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
