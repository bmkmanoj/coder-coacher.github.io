mean to be pythonic Wow chainsaw right
okay so so pythonic is a word that sort
of describes the way you would do things
in Python if you were an expert Python
programmer and we have mostly not tried
to do things in the most pythonic way in
this class because I want to keep the
subset of Python we use as small as
possible so many of the things we've
done they're very clever ways to do then
in Python which would take advantage of
features we don't see one that comes to
mind was a student touch to the solution
to the pseudocode probably he'll listen
crystal is a fantastic one line solution
that used a few things we hadn't covered
in the class but if you want to see the
pythonic way to solve problems I would
encourage you definitely to take Peter
Harvick's class which is a CS 262 that
he's really a master at using Python in
a very clever way and finding a way to
solve problems that you would think
would require hundreds of lines of code
and then both by you know mostly clever
thinking in clever ways of solving it
but also using features of Python in the
the best possible way finds a way to
solve it in two or three lines and so if
you're getting more experience as a
programmer you're going to be finding
these very elegant short solutions that
take advantage of more features in the
language than we've used in cs101</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
