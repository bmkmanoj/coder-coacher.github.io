simpler coherence protocols called MSI
in MSI a block can be in one of three
states in a cache I stands for the
invalid state a block is in an invalid
state either when it is present in the
cache but it's valid bit would not be
set or when it's simply not present in
the cache so block that is not present
in the cache is treated like it is
present but in an invalid state S stands
for the shared state a block that is in
the shared state in a cache can be read
without any further ado but if we write
it we have to do something
a local read to a block that is in the
shared state keeps the Block in the
shared state and doesn't do anything
else
and finally M stands for the modified
state in this state we can read the
block just like in the shared state
without sending anything out and we can
also write to this block by the local
core without sending anything out now
because this is an invalidation based
protocol what happens is in the modified
state we are sure that there are no
other cached copies which is why we are
allowed to locally write we don't have
to tell anybody that we are writing
because we know there is nobody so this
is sort of equivalent to having valid
equals one and dirty equals one in a
normal cache we just call this state
modified because it's easier to
understand what's going on this way then
if we have to look at individual bits
and we will see that with more
complicated coherence protocols we will
add maybe a state or two but we would
need to add several bits in order to
track what's going on so now in the
invalid state we have what's equivalent
to valid bit being zero pretty much we
behave like we don't have the block
either because we really don't have it
or because we have it but we are not
supposed to read it to write it so when
we have a write and the block is in the
invalid state we move the block to the
modified state so when you have a local
write meaning the
local processor wants to write and the
block is in the invalid state we move
the block to the modified state but we
cannot just do that to do that we have
to put the write request on the bus so
pretty much this is a write miss we have
to tell others that it's a write miss we
get the data and now we can put it in
the modified state why well because our
write request on the bus pretty much
made sure that nobody else has a copy
anymore because the write request that
we made invalidated everybody else if we
have a block in the modified state and
we observe on the bus that another cache
is placing a write on the bus then we
will go to the invalid state so we do
this when we snoop the write on the bus
and we cannot just do this and be done
when we snoop a write on the bus because
we are in the modified state where we
have the dirty copy meaning really the
only fresh copy of the data in the
system is in our cache it's not even in
memory because it's dirty here we have
to write the block back as we are
transitioning to invalid and we have to
delay the data that would be sent to the
write request until we are done with the
right back this can be done in two ways
one is to actually cancel that request
right back move to invalid and then that
request gets repeated and now gets the
data from memory another one is when we
see a write on the bus if it's
requesting data then what we do is we
suppress the memory response and feed
the data to that processor the simpler
way of doing things is just to delay
that request right back and then let it
proceed but either way we have to make
sure that before we move from modified
to invalid we write back the data to
memory and also make sure that the write
request if it is a write miss and if the
data gets our new data not the data from
memory now if we snoop a read on the bus
and we are in the modified state then we
move to the shared state so we have
snooped a read on the bus we will now
not be the only one who has a copy of
the data that means we will not be able
to
without telling others so we will move
to the shared state just like here we
have to also make sure that the block is
written back the shared state is
equivalent to having V equals one and D
equals zero so we will not be doing a
write back from our shared state because
it only allows reads anyway so as we are
moving from the dirty to a clean state
modified to share we are going to write
back the data the reading processor
wants a copy of this block again we have
to either delay that request do a write
back change to the shared state and then
let that processor proceed with a read
or we have to suppress the memory
response that would happen as a result
of this read and provide our data
instead as we are transitioning to the
shared state if the processor reads a
block and the block is in the invalid
state then the block will be moved to a
shared state so in response to a local
read we put a read request on the bus
and then we get the data and then we are
in the shared state for that data note
that the data might come from memory or
it may come from another cache because
it had the data in the modify state and
we needed to get that data but as far as
this local cache is concerned it puts a
read request on the bus it gets the data
and then it put that block in the shared
state in the local cache then we can do
many reads without telling anybody if we
have a block in the shared state and we
observe a snooped write on the bus then
we move the block to the invalid state
we don't have to do anything because the
block is clean as far as we are
concerned we don't have to write it back
we simply have to do the equivalent of
resetting the valid bit and move to the
invalid state so there is nothing really
that we have to do except change the
state so that next time we try to read
it we can no longer read it here we have
to put a read request on the bus again
if we snoop a read on the bus in the
shared state we don't need to do
anything why well because our shared
state is okay with there being other
shares that are only going to read the
data and finally all the low
reeds are okay in the shared state if we
have a local right that is not allowed
in the shared state so a local right
that finds the Block in the shared state
will make us move the block to a
modified state but we cannot do that
silently we cannot just move the block
and right to it what we have to do is
put an invalidation on the bus now that
things are slightly different when we
move from invalid state on a local right
to modified and when we moved from
shared state to a modified state on a
local right here we put a write request
that asks for a block so that we can
write it here we already have the block
this is the most up-to-date copy because
if there was another right after that we
would not have it in the shared state so
now we want to write to it we already
have the data we just need to put an
invalidation request on the bus so this
invalidation request does not actually
request the data it just puts a request
on the bus for everybody to invalidate
their copies but it's not asking for the
data so pretty much as soon as we put
risk request on the bus we can write
because by putting an invalidation on
the bus we have made sure that now
everybody is invalidated at which point
we are in the modified State now of
course in the invalid state whatever we
snoop for this block on the bus doesn't
matter we're going to stay in the
invalid state also in the shared state
it doesn't matter whether we snoop
somebody's request to write or an
invalidation that they put on the bus we
still move to the invalid state without
doing much and finally note that if we
are in a modified state we will observe
a write if somebody wants to write and
not an invalidation because if we are in
the modified state that means that
everybody else is in the invalid state
for this block so if they want to write
they'll have to put a write request on
the bus they cannot be in the shared
state and put just an invalidation out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
