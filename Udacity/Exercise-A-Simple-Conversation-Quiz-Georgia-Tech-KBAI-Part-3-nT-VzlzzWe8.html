let us continue with there were metaphor
of machines with whom we can talk in
stories
now the Watson program in the CD program
normally they understand stories that
are limited to one sentence you can ask
Watson a question you can ask CD a
question and those questions are the one
sentence questions
similarly when Siri and Watson reply
they typically give their answers in one
word or one sentence at most but studies
play a very important role in the life
of cognitive agents and we would expect
our agents that live among cognitive
agents also to be able to understand
stories and one of the common roles of
sorry players that they enable more
common-sense reasoning to see how
stories enable common-sense reasoning
consider two simple sentences imagine
that first sentence was Ali asked do you
think we'll have many customers Linux
hoffa and the second sentence is Sarah
replied go ahead and grab your lunch so
these are two sentences of a story does
the story make sense to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
