work if you didn't get that answer let's
see how we got that answer first I know
that the width of a rectangle is 9
inches less than its length so we can
write the width W is equal to 9 inches
less than its length so that's going to
be L minus 9 the width is 9 inches less
than its length we also know that the
perimeter is 58 inches we know the
equation for perimeter is 2 times the
length plus 2 times the width or 2l plus
2w if we know that W is l minus 9 we can
simply replace w in this equation with
what W equals which is l minus 9 and we
know that the perimeter is 58 inches so
i have 2 l plus 2 times w but w equals L
minus 9 and that equals 58 now I have an
equation that I can solve first I need
to distribute so i have 2 l plus 2l 2
times negative 9 is negative 18 and that
equals 58 now i can combine like terms
2l plus 2l as 4l add 18 to both sides so
now i have for l equals fifty eight plus
18 which is 76 so for l equals 76 divide
both sides by 4 and i get that l equals
19 so i have for l equals 76 i divide
both sides by 4 which gives me l equals
19 so here's one of the dimensions of my
rectangle 19 inches is the length to get
the width I know the width is equal to
the length minus nine so the width is
equal to the length which is 19-9 which
gives me 10 so the dimensions of the
rectangle are 19 inches by 10 inches
let's try a ratio problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
