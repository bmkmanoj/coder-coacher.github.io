substitute in new values for these two
quantities money from all original
orders and money from canceled orders
into this expression using these other
two equations as we learned about
substitution very early on in the course
if we have a system of equations that we
know is allowed to work together and one
quantity in one of the equations is
equal to another quantity in another one
of the equations we can replace that
quantity with the other way to express
it so in the case of these equations
that means we can replace money from all
original orders right here with this
expression 87 W plus 72 n since this
equation tells us that that is equal to
the money from all the original orders
we can do the same thing with the money
from the canceled orders or the amount
of money that grant would have gotten if
these orders hadn't been canceled so
we'll replace money from canceled orders
with 3w plus 12 n so this is what the
equation looks like if we just replace
that word money from canceled orders
with the mathematical expression we knew
that it's equal to but we need to do one
thing to change this equation we need to
add parentheses around 3w plus 12 n now
the reason we need to do that is because
we know that we want to subtract the
entire amount of money that grant would
have earned from the orders that are now
cancelled so to show that this is one
quantity one sum of money the money he
would have earned from the wipers and
the money he would have earned from the
nozzles we put parentheses around it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
