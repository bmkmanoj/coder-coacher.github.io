select star from links where submitter
ID equals six two four four three order
by submitted time ASC four ascending and
these are the constraints of the
question six three four four four three
and submission time and then what I'm
doing is I'm iterating over the results
making a link appending the links ID to
the list of results and then I'm
returning results okay so let's go ahead
and give this a run to make sure it
works we see our answer is 15 18 21
those are the the correct link IDs my
answer it looks the way it does because
I've been following the the form we've
been kind of working in the general
structure of this function but if I were
to actually make a function that does
just this just returns the IDS of the
links there's a couple things that are
wasteful in here that I'll go ahead and
clean up and show you so the first thing
is we don't need to select star from
links all we care about is the IDs so
we'll just select the IDs here we're
creating a link object for every every
row we get back well we don't actually
need the link object if we're just going
to get the IDS from the results we can
just return those nearly directly so
let's get rid of this loop and instead
change it to something like this
okay so I've simplified this quite a bit
this syntax here is a list comprehension
that's it's a simple way of making a
list so we still run our sequel this
time we're only selecting ID and since
the sequel light library in Python
returns tuples of the results and in
this case we're only asking for the ID
we know the first column is going to be
the ID so for t and c so for for the
tupple in the cursor make a list of the
first element of each of those tuples
store that results and return it let's
go ahead and print this and the answer
is the same 15 18 101 okay so just a
little extra Python there for you let's
move along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
