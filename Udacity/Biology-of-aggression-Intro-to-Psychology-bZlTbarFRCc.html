turns out that overall gender is the
best predictor of aggression men being
more likely to commit crimes such as
murder battery and assault culture may
also account for some of this in that
aggressiveness may be a product of
socialization it appears that many
societies encourage males to be more
aggressive than females but our biology
clearly plays a role too
do you remember when we discussed
testosterone and our lesson on
motivation and emotion well testosterone
is the male sex hormone however you'll
recall that women also have testosterone
and that's important for our sexual
response we see the testosterone is
related to aggression in that those with
higher levels of testosterone correlate
positively with the tendency towards
aggression and violence or something
else that's important to aggression is
serotonin it turns out that low levels
of serotonin actually make aggression
more likely in humans as well as in
other animals so we see that our biology
plays a role in aggression and our
social influences can play a role in
aggression now our boys aggressive in
the same way as girls and how does the
social world influence our aggressive
behaviors we see that boys may model
other boys or men and imitate aggressive
behaviors such as punching kicking or so
forth if it asks for girls we do see
that they can be physically aggressive
oftentimes we see that girls engage in
what we call indirect aggression that's
not necessarily hitting or punching but
engaging in behaviors that may exclude
an individual for example girls may be
more likely to talk badly about a person
spread rumors about a person or make fun
of a person or generally just engage in
ways to psychologically hurt an
individual we can argue that the pain of
being punched in the face or having
rumors spread about you can be very
similar because as we've said a few
times before the experience of physical
and psychological pain both activate the
same areas of the brain now let's go
