look at the middle compartment which is
for purposes of describing attributes
you'll see that there are different
attributes describe all of them have
names they have types and they may have
some other symbols that describe how the
names can be accessed from other classes
those symbols describe the visibility of
that name they're optional you don't
have to provide them and there's no
reason that the start to do that there
are a refinement which you add later on
in the process the four options in UML
for visibility include publicly visible
that's a plus sign private which is a
minus sign protected meaning that only
subclasses can access that attribute is
the pound sign and for those situations
where you've used UML packages the tilde
indicates that the name is visible
within the package in addition to the
visibility of course you must have the
name of the attribute you can indicate
the multiplicity and ordering of the
attribute now they're not shown in this
example but we'll see them later you
should give the type of the attribute
and uml has a set of built-in types that
you can use you can optionally describe
an initial value for that particular
instance variable you can indicate that
the instance variable is derived that is
it's computed rather than being set
directly and you can give some
additional properties to the instance
variable using the braces notation that
we mentioned before for example we can
indicate that that particular instance
variable is frozen that means its value
can't change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
