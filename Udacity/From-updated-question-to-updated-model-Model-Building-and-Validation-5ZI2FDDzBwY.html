looked at how linear regression
performed on our initial feature set and
decided to reduce the feature set to a
simpler selection specifically the top
three performing features hershey's
KitKat and airheads simpler models are
usually more effective than complex
models in particular reducing the number
of features as much as possible to those
that matter most is almost always
beneficial moreover lower numbers of
features avoid the curse of
dimensionality which is something that
we'll talk about much more later on in
this course let's now evaluate the newer
model with the reduced feature set and
in this plot just as before the green
line refers to the true inter selection
time and the blue line refers to our
model now in this model our predictor is
using less information to predict the
demand for starburst you can see here
the result of doing so notice that our
predicted line is a bit less jagged than
the line that uses all of the features
which indicates that we're overfitting
less revising the feature set choice
from the question phase successfully
resulted in reducing overfitting we can
also see now the new mean squared error
of our new model now let's make a plot
on the test set the overfitting issue
has been somewhat resolved but now we
need to examine the issue of our model
missing the spikes in inter selection
times clearly this time we cannot avoid
having to make a different choice at the
model phase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
