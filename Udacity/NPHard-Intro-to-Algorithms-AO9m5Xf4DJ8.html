next is the idea that there are some
problems such that if we could solve
them fast we could solve all problems in
NP fast and we call those problems the
NP hard problems I don't find that to be
a particularly useful name it's the name
that everybody uses so I will use it as
well so how can we say that some problem
X is at least as hard at least within
polynomial factors as some other problem
why so or to phrase it another way if X
is at least as hard as Y what could we
do with an algorithm for X well we could
use it to solve Y in fact that's maybe
what we mean by saying that X is at
least as hard as Y that we can use a
solution to X to solve Y so the basic
picture that you can have in your head
is something like this so imagine that
we want to solve an instance of problem
Y we can imagine building a solution
algorithm and algorithm for y that what
happens inside is an instance of problem
Y gets transformed in some way to an
instance of problem X or maybe multiple
instances of problem X then we run an
algorithm for solving problem X to get
solutions to those and maybe that
generates more instances but after a
polynomial number of calls to this
algorithm what's become spitting out is
a solution to the original instance of
problem Y so we basically have solved
problem Y by bringing to bear our
solution to problem X or to say it
another way problem Y has been reduced
to problem X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
