that different personalities prefer
different careers and college majors in
fact college counseling centers often
Minister one personality questionnaire
when trying to guide students who are
still searching for a career that fits
them that questionnaire is the
myers-briggs Type Indicator
or the MBTI for short the MBTI consists
of opposing personality types of
extraversion and introversion thinking
and feeling intuition and sensing and
judging and perceiving in other words
people are classified either as an
extrovert or an introvert or as a
thinker or as a feeler and so on for
example intuition and sensing describes
how people prefer to take in information
focused on what is real and actual so
sensing or on patterns and meanings and
data so intuition
whereas thinking and feeling describes
how people prefer to make decisions
based on logical analysis so thinking or
prefer making decisions guided by the
concern for the emotional impact it has
on others so feeling our personality
types are different than forms of
dimensions because they categorize
people as either one type or the other
rather than on a continuum from high to
low like we see with the big five
researchers using the MBTI have found
that extroverts prefer social and
enterprising majors such as psychology
or social work even elementary education
whereas thinking types prefer realistic
and investigative majors such as
mechanical engineering or archaeology
feeling types prefer artistic and social
majors such as art music or theater</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
