here's our definition and let's try this
out
so we'll print the result of Fibonacci 0
first we should get 0 which we do we'll
try Fibonacci 1 we get 1 so we've seen
our two base cases now when we do
Fibonacci two what we should get is the
result of Fibonacci 1 which is 1 plus
Fibonacci 2 minus 2 which is Fibonacci 0
which is 0 so we should get 1 again
which we do and now let's try printing
Fibonacci 3 we get 2 and if we print
Fibonacci 4 we should get 1 plus 2 which
is 3 which we get and if we try 5
we should get 2 plus 3 which is 5 and
let's try something a little bigger
let's slide Fibonacci 10 we get 55 we'll
try Fibonacci 25 so we'll try Fibonacci
24 so for counting months that would be
the number of rabbits in two years and
we get 46,000 and let's try in 3 years
our program times out so I'm going to
try this soon in the Python interpreter
we'll see we can do slightly bigger ones
but the time it takes to solve Fibonacci
this way is very long and the reason for
that is because we're doing lots and
lots of redundant calculation so if we
look at what our code is doing every
time we call Fibonacci n what's
happening is we're calling Fibonacci n
minus 1 and we're calling Fibonacci n
minus 2 so we're starting we're calling
Fibonacci 36 that was the example where
the interpreter didn't finish and what
we'll get is that's going to be broken
down into calling Fibonacci 35 plus the
result that we get from calling
Fibonacci 34 each of those is another
called the Fibonacci so the call
Fibonacci 35 well that will be broken
into calling Fibonacci 34 and adding
that result to what we get from calling
Fibonacci 33 and when we do Fibonacci 34
here well that's going to be turned into
calling Fibonacci 33 and adding the
result to Fibonacci 32 we're going to do
lots and lots of calculations here and
we haven't got close to getting down to
fib l1 or fib of 0 which is the only
places that we stop if we look at the
number of times we have to evaluate
Fibble 3-2 let's pick that one so
Fibonacci 32 so we need to evaluate
Fibonacci 32 one two three four five
times the number of times we had to
evaluate the Bonacci 33 was one two
three times the number of times we had
to evaluate Fibonacci 34 was two times
and the number of times we had to
evaluate Fibonacci 35 was one time and
the number of times we had to evaluate
Fibonacci 36 was one time so maybe you
can see a pattern here how many times
you think we're going to need to
evaluate Fibonacci 31</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
