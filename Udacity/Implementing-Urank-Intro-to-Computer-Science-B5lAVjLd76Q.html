modifying the crawl web procedure so
that instead of returning just the index
it returns both in index and a graph and
the graph gives the link structure the
graph should be a dictionary where the
entries in the graph are a URL which is
the target page and a list which is the
pages that link to that target so to
test your graph making code we've
provided a sample site at this URL so if
that's the link that you pass in as the
seed for the crawl web it's going to
crawl the site we set up and there's an
index page that looks like this it's got
five links on it and those links go to
different web pages so the first one
goes to my favorite hummus recipe so
there's a link from index.html and it
goes to the page hummus dot HTML and if
we follow that link we get to a page
that has no links on it the second link
goes to a page arsenic HTML and that
page includes a link to the nickel
chef's page and the nickel chef's page
includes a link to Kathleen dot HTML and
that page has no links on it and the
third link on the index page also goes
to the Kathleen dot HTML page and
there's two more links on the start page
the first one goes to the nickel chef
page which we've already seen and the
last link goes to the zinc chef and from
the zinc chef page we have two more
links we have one to the nickel page and
we have one to the arsenic chef's famous
hummus recipe page so this is a pretty
complicated link structure although it's
very simple compared to things that we
actually find on the web but your goal
is to be able to produce this graph by
modifying the code that we have for
crawl web and then once we have the page
ranks we'll be able to use PageRank to
find the best page to find a home this
recipe so for this site the graph that
your crawl web should produce should
have entries that show these connections
so there should be an entry where the
URL is the you rank slash index dot HTML
I'm leaving out the beginning of the URL
and the entries should be a list of all
the pages that that links to so they're
going to be five pages all five of these
should be in the list here there should
be in the hummus page there should be
the arsenic page and the other three
pages the order that links appear in
this list doesn't matter it's correct as
long as you have all five of the links
that you can reach from the index.html
page the Kathleen dot HTML page doesn't
have any outgoing links so the entry for
Kathleen dot HTML should be an empty
list so see if you can figure out how to
change the code for crawl web to produce
as its second output a graph that shows
the structure of the web pages that we
crawled</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
