and programming is really the core of
computer science most machines are
designed to do just one thing this is
supposed to be a toaster it's more of a
representational drawing than an
accurate one and a toaster well we can
do more than one thing with the toaster
maybe we can put different things in it
we can toast bread we can toast muffins
maybe it has some things we can use to
change its behavior a little bit we can
turn a setting to make it toast for
longer or shorter but it's pretty
limited what it can do everything it can
do is a variation on this basic
functionality that was designed for this
basic process of putting toast in
heating it up and getting the toast to
pop out if we want to change its
behavior due to something really
different
we'd have to physically alter the
machine we could maybe take the parts
out put them together in a new way if
we're really creative we could make a
bicycle from the toaster that would be a
pretty big project though so without a
program a computer is even less useful
than a toaster can't do anything without
a program the program is what tells the
computer what to do and the power of a
computer is that unlike a toaster which
is really designed to only do a few
things a computer can do anything a
computer is a universal machine we can
program it to do essentially any
computation so anything that we can
imagine anything that we can figure out
how to write a program for we can make
the computer do and what the program
needs to be is a very precise sequence
of steps the computer by itself doesn't
know how to do anything it has a few
simple instructions that it can execute
and to make a program do something
useful we need to put those instructions
together in a way that does what we want
so we can turn the computer into a web
browser into a server into a game
playing machine into a toaster without
any where to put the bread but into
anything that we can imagine at least
any computation we want to do and the
power of the computers that it can
execute those steps super super fast so
we can execute billions of instructions
in one second the program gives us a way
to tell the computer what steps to take
so there are many different languages
for programming computers the language
we're going to learn in this course of
the language called Python like the
snake it's also named after
monty python and the important thing
about python is it gives us a nice
high-level language that we can use to
write programs and that means instead of
our program running directly on the
computer the programs that we write will
be the input to the Python program which
runs on the computer
what python is is called an interpreter
that means it runs our programs it
interprets them execute the program that
we wrote in the Python language by
running a program in the language that
the computer can understand directly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
