casting and Swift here's what i mean by
down casting occasionally objects are
labeled as members of a particular class
but can also act as a member of a
subclass too downcast is to cast such an
object as an instance of its subclass
you'll see a lot of down casting with
optionals when you start interacting
with classes like UI storyboard and the
app delegate but let's start with a
simpler example here we have a beverage
class with two subclasses hot drink and
cold drink we also have an array of
beverages because there are both hot
drinks and cold drinks in this array the
array must be of class beverage there
are no mixed type arrays in Swift let's
say we wanted to loop through the array
of beverages and generate a message that
will offer each of the drink choices
when we loop through the array each item
will be treated as a beverage but we
really want our message to be more
specific than that it would be better if
we could cast a beverage as a hot drink
or a cold drink before offering a drink
to a guest now there are two points here
i'd like you to remember first focus on
this piece of code here when we grab a
drink from the array we don't know
whether it can be cast to a cold drink
or not so we use an optional cast with
an ass ? also known as a typecast
operator by casting the item from the
array as an optional cold drink we're
saying this item could be a cold drink
or it could be new here's the second
point I'd like you to remember as we
know optionals can't be used until
they're unwrapped so if you use the as ?
typecast operator you also have some
unwrapping to do just like we've done
previously with other optionals we can
use if let remember that the if let
construction checks to see if an
optional has a value if it does have a
value this code gets executed and we can
use cold drink in our message if it
doesn't have a value the else block is
executed and the beverage is cast as a
hot drink and here in the sidebar we can
see those custom messages but let's not
forget about the exclamation points
although they are risk
II they can also be convenient in cases
where we're confident about the identity
of the object being downcast let's say
we're a coffee shop we only serve hot
coffee but for some reason a method from
an apple library is returning an array
of items of class beverage if we never
deal in cold drinks we might boldly
downcast beverages to hot drinks using
as ! as we know optionals with
exclamation points automatically
unwrapped so our down casting work is
done know if let required</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
