halves X plus 7 halves now remember just
because you see fractions doesn't mean
it's wrong let's see how we got that
answer again this is a two-part question
first we have to find the slope and then
we have to find the equation so first
let's find the slope I know the equation
of slope is y2 minus y1 over x2 minus x1
I'm going to go ahead and label my
points this is x1 y1 and this is x2 y2
again this helps me make sure I put the
numbers in the right places so the slope
y 2 is negative 1 minus y1 which is 2
over X 2 which is three minus x1 which
is 1 so we have negative one minus two
is negative 3 over 3 minus 1 is 2 so we
know the slope is negative 3 halves
which is why you see negative 3 halves X
in the equation but how do we get 7
halves there's a couple different ways
to do this we also know that the slope
is equal to Y minus y1 over X minus x1
so our slope was negative 3 halves and
that's going to equal Y minus y 1 y 1 is
2 over X minus x1 which is one and again
I can cross multiply when i cross
multiply i have negative 3 times x minus
one equals 2 times y minus 2 now I have
to distribute after i distribute i have
negative 3x negative 3 times negative 1
is positive 3 equals 2y 2 times negative
2 is negative 4 to put this in
slope-intercept form to put this
equation in slope-intercept form the
first thing i'm going to do is subtract
3 from both sides and i get negative 3x
equals 2y minus 7 if I just go ahead and
add 4 to both sides i get negative 3x
plus 7 equals 2y and I can still divide
everything through by
too and i get y equals negative 3 halves
x plus 7 halves and we know that
negative 3 halves X plus 7 halves equals
y is the same as y equals negative 3
halves X plus 7 halves now we're going
to try a couple of problems with
parallel and perpendicular lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
