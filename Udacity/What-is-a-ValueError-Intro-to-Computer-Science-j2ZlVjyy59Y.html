should have been able to figure out that
at least it's an object everything
referenceable is an object and to keep
the design consistent we don't want
special things we want everything to be
an object so it's some kind of object
what kind of object is it well it's a
value error so certainly the last one is
correct that it's an instance of the
value error type value error is a
subtype of exception so it's also an
instance of the exception type it's not
an instance of the I or type and that's
why the accept handler for i/o error
didn't handle the value error here's an
example of the kind of experiment you
might do to understand what's going on
here so I've changed instead of having
i/o error here I've changed this to
exception so this means any exception
that's a subtype of exception will be
handled by this exception handler and
what I'm going to do in the handler I'll
print out the type of exception then I
have three assertions all about the type
of e the first checks if it's an
instance of value error we expect that
to be true the second checks if it's an
instance of exception which we also
expect to be true and the third checks
if it's an instance of i/o error that we
expect to be false you may be able to
guess what happens when an assertion
fails let's try running this code to see
so let's see what happens when we try
running this code and here's what we get
we see that we got the exception and
it's type is type exceptions valueerror
exceptions is a built-in module to
python and we don't need to important we
have the value error exception type and
we can see that the assertion on line 10
failed that means the first two
succeeded and what happened when it
failed is we got a new kind of exception
which is an assertion error
congratulations have you guessed that
what happens when in a search and error
fails is you get an exception</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
