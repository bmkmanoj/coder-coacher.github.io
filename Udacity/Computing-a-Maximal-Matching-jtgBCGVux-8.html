getting a coarsened graph all we need
now is an algorithm to compute one let
me describe a simple scheme to you based
on randomization at each step of this
scheme you'll choose any unmatched
vertex at random so initially no edges
are matched so let's pick any vertex hmm
how about this one next you'll match
this vertex to one of its unmatched
neighbors again since we're just
starting all of the neighbors are
unmatched so how do we pick one well
there are lots of strategies for example
you could just pick one at random a
different approach is something called a
heavy edge matching strategy so heavy so
heavy the idea is to look at the
unmatched edge with the highest weight
and then choose it for instance suppose
these are the edge weights then among
the two unmatched neighbors this edge
has the higher edge weight two versus
one so you'd choose it but why is the
heavy edge matching strategy a good one
in fact there's not a whole lot of
definitive rigorous analysis out there
but there is a lot of experimental
evidence what I want to do now is just
give you some informal intuition
consider some graph G sub I suppose we
were to match these two edges
contracting them would yield a course in
graph let's call it G sub I plus one
note the edge weight of two that
connects the two super vertices now if
you were to sum the edge weights in the
original graph you'd get 12 that's
because there are 12 edges each of unit
weight here let me use the notation
capital X of some object to count the
number of edges in that object now the
sum of the weights on the final graph is
10 this is just the total edge weight of
the original graph minus the edge weight
of the matched edges here let M sub I
denote the matching now the strategy of
selecting heavy edges will tend to try
to increase this factor and if this
factor is bigger than this factor will
be smaller in other words the heavy edge
heuristic is really about increasing
this term in order to decrease the
overall edge weight in the next graph
the heuristic idea is that the smaller
this term is the more likely it is that
all the edges you'll cut will be
small again this is clearly not a
rigorous proof in fact there are ton of
other heuristics but most of the
evidence is empirical anyway this is a
topic of interest you head to the
instructors notes or the class forum for
pointers to papers that will discuss all
these issues in a lot of detail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
