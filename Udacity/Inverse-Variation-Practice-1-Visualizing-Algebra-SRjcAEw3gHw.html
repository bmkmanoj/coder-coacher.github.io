variation so let's look at inverse
variation earlier we determined that the
speed of a vehicle and the driving time
were inversely related if we drive
really fast then we don't need as much
time to get to our final destination if
a car takes 20 minutes to travel some
distance at 45 miles per hour how long
would it take that same car to travel
the same exact distance driving at 60
miles per hour we want to be very
careful though we don't want to use this
proportion this is for direct variation
this proportion would say that if we
drive faster then it would take longer
to get somewhere but we know this is not
true we know if we dry faster than our
time spent driving decreases so instead
of doing this we can flip the second
fraction over if we flip the second
fraction over we can see that our speed
now would be decreasing if we drive
slower then it should take longer amount
of time to get there this also fits
worth our notion of speed and time if
speed increases time decreases likewise
if speed decreases as in this case then
we know that we should expect to drive
longer time increases for inverse
variation we always want to put the
other quantity and the opposite position
will need to flip the fraction that
varies inversely so what do you think
how long would it take us to drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
