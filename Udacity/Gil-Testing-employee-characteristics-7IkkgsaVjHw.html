co-founder to interview each early
employee that walks through the door in
the first few months of the company you
want everybody to be aligned that this
Ohio is good for the core they not only
for the business but for the company's
culture there's no one way of testing
for the culture it's really a feel but I
think there's there's very specific ways
to take to test on the professional side
but on the culture side it's making sure
that that person is aligned with what
you do so asking them about the
experiences in previous places of work
that where they've had what they liked
and disliked what are they looking for
in terms of a job right those are the
things that you need to be T ask upon
and then I think spending over spending
time with that person is key don't just
make quick hires because you need
somebody to walk through the door you
spend an hour looks good let's get going
actually spend a lot spent more time
than you thought originally and
especially in the early days of your
startup because you want to make sure
that person is right for the type of
business you building not just
professionally but culturally as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
