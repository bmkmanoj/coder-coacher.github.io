adding more cores might result in a slow
down if we have to stay within the same
power budget but this is only true if we
cannot adjust the voltage and frequency
so that when there is no parallelism
available we boost the frequency of the
one or two active course so that they
get the full power budget of the chip
modern processors do this let's look at
an example of intel's core i7 4700mq
which was released in the 2nd quarter of
2013 it's a mobile processor so it's
design power is only 37 wats that's what
we can call in a laptop apparently it
has four cores and it's normal clock
when using all four cores is 2.2
gigahertz maximum it can actually save
power because it might operate on a
battery by reducing this frequency even
when running all four cores but the
processor has a turbo frequency of 3.2
gigahertz when running only one core
that frequency is one point 45 times the
normal frequency if we assume that the
power increases cubicle II with this
then we would get three times the power
so we are not using four times the power
of a single core which we should be able
to get because it's four cores so when
operating one quarter of the course that
one quarter of the course can get four
times the power we're only getting three
times so the question is why not four
times well because it's not only about
the overall shape power what's really
happening is that if we have a
relatively large ship and we have four
cores on it let's say and we keep
heating up this part of the chip the
heat will spread into other parts of the
chip but this one will still be hotter
than the others so if we're spending
power evenly across the chip we can
spend more power than if we spend it all
in one corner of the chip because if we
spread their power around
then the chip overall gets hotter if we
spend all power in the same place then
that place gets a lot hotter than before
so that's why three times and not four
times because at three times the power
this part of the chip achieved similar
temperatures to those achieved by
spreading the heat around at 2.2
gigahertz let's look at another example
which is Intel's Core i7 4770 one it's a
similar processor released in third
quarter of 2013 so they're relatively
similar in terms of technology and so on
but this is not a laptop processor its
design power is much higher at 84 watts
it also has four course but the normal
clock of a core is now three point five
gigahertz much larger than in the mobile
processor the turbo clock when running
only one core is 3.9 gigahertz or only
eleven percent above normal and if we
assume that the power is cubicle e
growing with frequency that means it's
only spending one point thirty eight
times the power of a core when working
with three other course why is it like
that well because this being a non
mobile processor has much better cooling
so it can cool the chip when operating
at this high power but that also means
that the chip is already pretty hot and
getting it even slightly hotter in any
place very quickly reaches the
temperatures at which it's dangerous for
the chip so we could only really spend
this much more power in one core even
though the others are not working so
pretty much what's happening is when
running it for course the chip is very
close to not being able to cool if we
turbo boost a particular part of the
chip it gets even hotter and we can only
afford a little bit more of heat before
we run into cooling issues even though
the heat is kind of leaking to the
cooler parts of the chip is just not
doing
enough and this is pretty typical that
course designed for lower power have
more flexibility in shifting that power
whereas if we are near the limits of
what we can do then really shifting the
power so that it can all be consumed in
one corner very quickly gets that one
corner of the chip to overheat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
