hand rank the most complicated function
we'll have to deal with
we know hand rank takes a hand as input
but what is it return we want it to
return a value indicate the ranking of a
hand well not quite sure what that value
should be it has to be something that's
comparable by max so well why not a
number there are nine different types of
hands that we know about from a straight
flush at the at the top to high card at
the bottom and we can number them from
say 0 to 8 with the 8 being the highest
for the straight flush so here's a
sketch of a solution we know it's going
to be important to look at ranks so
let's get them first we can extract the
ranks with our card ranks function and
then we can say first we want to check
you can see if we have a straight flush
so if the ranks form a straight and the
cards form a flush then we can return 8
the highest value otherwise what's next
well four of a kind and the only thing
we need in kind is the rank so I'm gonna
just pass that in so if the ranks form
four of a kind then return 7 and we
could go on from there and I go through
the cases one by one so we have a
straight flush we have four of a kind we
would next go to full house and then
flush and so on now the question is
would this work if we continue to flesh
this out and we define the nine
different cases to return that the
numbers from zero to eight would that
give us the definition of hand rank
that's a working program I want you to
tell me yes it would work fine in all
cases no it would signal an error
condition and crash the program no it
would get some
inputs wrong and some of them right or
no it would get all the inputs wrong
which do you think is correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
