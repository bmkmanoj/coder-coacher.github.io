us see how planning differs from search
and from other methods like means-ends
analysis that we have come across
earlier in fact some of you may
recognize this particular figure we had
exactly the same figure when we were
talking about means-ends analysis well
first let us compare planning to search
here is what we could do given the
initial state we could apply to the
initial state all the operators that are
applicable to the initial state that
will give us a range of states then to
each successor state we could all apply
all the operators at well we'll able to
that state that will give us small
states and so we could keep on expanding
this but I am sure you can see what will
happen there'll be a comedy total
explosion in this search for this
problem is extremely inefficient so to
take an example of this this would be
like if you were trying to plan a route
somewhere and at each individual
intersection you took each possible turn
as a different possible operator to get
to the next state then for every
intersection that those turns led to you
to consider each turn at those
intersections even if they were taking
you far away from your actual goal
destination you can imagine that if you
were to look at every single
intersection that you encounter on your
drive and every single possible
intersection that follows from this
turns you get an enormous number of
possibilities very quickly the vast
majority of which you're not actually
interested in that's good David and to
build on this example what do we
actually do when we have to plan a
navigation route to go from one location
to another location in an urban area we
use knowledge the goal the goal tells us
what don't you take at every
intersection we want to take a turn that
helps us get closer to the goal so one
thing we are learning here is there a
different kinds of knowledge there is
knowledge about the world the
intersections and it turns the states
and the operators more generally there
is also a sec knowledge about how to do
the operator selection how to select
between various terms at any
intersection this knowledge is tacit and
is sometimes called control knowledge
goals provide us with the control
knowledge of deciding how to select
between different operators let us
recall how means-ends analysis worked
how goes provided control knowledge in
mean since analysis means its analysis
the heuristic method if you compare
occur
the goal state and enumerate the
differences between them then we'll
select the operator that will help us
reduce the largest difference between
the current state the goal state that's
one way of using goals as control
knowledge to select between operators
planning provides more systematic
methods for selecting between different
operators so the real problem becomes
how to do operate a selection which is
the same problem as how to do action
selection recall that mean we're talking
about intelligent agents would define
intelligent agents as agents at map
perceptual history into actions action
selection was a key problem was a
central problem this is why planning a
central because it deals directly with
action selection or with operative
selection operators simply mental
representations of actions available in
the world so let us look at what a plan
might look like in the language that we
have been developing for planning a plan
might look like this here is the initial
state in a set of successor States a
series of states punctuated by the
operators that transform one state into
another here we have expanded this
operator paint ceiling on the right to
specify its preconditions and
postconditions and there are several
things noteworthy here note that the
preconditions of this operator exactly
match the predecessor state so we have
on robot ladder here we have on robot
ladder here so some assertions of the
world are true here and those assertions
match the precondition which is why this
operator is applicable similarly the
post conditions of this operator
directly match the assertions over the
world in the successor state so I have
painted ceiling here it is painted
ceiling they're just not rising here it
is not right ceiling here so this
provides a very precise way of
specifying these states and the
operators and the exact connections
between them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
