mathematical formula so I cheated a
little bit I wrote a little piece of
code to actually generate a complete
graph and then return the number of
edges in that graph so to make a
complete graph I just loop through all
the pairs of nodes and if one node was
smaller than the other then I made a
link between them that was mainly to
just make sure I didn't make a link from
nodes to themselves
there was no reason not to make a link
the other way it would have not counted
against the total but this seemed nicer
and cleaner let's look at what happens
if you loop on all the different values
of n from 1 to 9 and print N and the
number of edges in the cleat a graph
with one node has no edges a graph with
two nodes fully connected has one edge
three has three that's a triangle four
has six which is the square with the X
through the middle of it five is that to
the pentagram looking thing that we just
showed a minute ago and it continues
growing up like that so with that as our
insight can we actually write down what
the formula is for a graph with n nodes
so essentially what happens is each node
gets an edge to each other node which we
can write as each node has an edge to
each other node but notice what happens
if we use that as our formula we're
going to count this edge this edge as it
goes from this node to this node we're
also going to count it again as it goes
from this node to this node so we've
double counted everything so that should
be our formula which is big theta of n
squared so let's just double-check this
if we print and click event which I
counted by actually creating the klique
compare that to the formula n times n
minus 1 over 2 you can see that it
matches up perfectly so really the
answer that you should have given is
this shouldn't have bothered with any of
this creating of stuff so now in
addition to all those graphs where the
growth rate was linear we now have one
that's quadratic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
