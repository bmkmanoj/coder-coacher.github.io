come up when you're doing array
operations matrix operations image
operations but the concept is generally
applicable to all kinds of data
structures let me let me give an example
so here's some sort of structure you
might have right it's a perfectly
reasonable structure foo it's got a
float field and an integer field and say
you have an array of a thousand of these
well what does that look like in memory
you're going to have the floats and the
integers interspersed throughout memory
and as we'll talk about later it can be
more efficient to access if you're going
to do a lot of processing on the floats
it can be more efficient to access all
of the floats contiguously you're going
to want some operation that lets you
take your what's called an array of
structures representation and turn it
into a structure of arrays and that
operation is again transpose by the way
these two terms are so common that array
of structures is often abbreviated AOS
and structure of arrays is often
abbreviated SOA you'll see these terms
come up frequently in parallel computing
so to summarize the transpose operation
is where tasks reorder data elements and
memory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
