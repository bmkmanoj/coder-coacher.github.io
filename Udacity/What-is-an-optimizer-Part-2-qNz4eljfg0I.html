X is equal to X minus 1.5 squared plus
0.5 that function is a parabola that
looks something like this it's centered
horizontally at 1.5 and its minima is
here at 0.5 now
the optimizer or the minimizer doesn't
know that we can tell it by looking at
the equation but the minimizer has to
figure it out on its own so let's
suppose we tell it a minimizer why don't
you start with a guess of 2.0 and see if
you can figure out from there what it is
so the minimizer says okay I'll give it
a go and here's what it does first thing
it does is it checks the value at 2.0 it
turns out that that's about 0.75 it then
tests the value nearby say here and here
and it finds out that G this equation
has a slope about like that at this
point now it's trying to minimize and so
what it does is it marches downhill it's
called gradient descent and it tries
another value down along that slope it
gets a particular value here tries
another one and so on and eventually it
narrows in and it discovers that 1.5 is
the value for x at the minima and the
value of y there is 0.5 now the example
I gave you for you know sort of marching
down this gradient descent is one method
there are many variations on that method
the different kinds of minimizer's use
and psy pi the library that we're using
has many of those options and you can
choose different ones according to your
taste we're going to stick with one
particular approach through our examples
here but you ought to experiment and try
some of the other ones as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
