one-half MV squared I hope that right
now you're seething I hope you're riding
in your chair and saying Andy that's not
what kinetic energy is that's an
equation that describes kinetic energy
what is kinetic energy Oh what is
kinetic energy well it's the energy
associated with motion why hope now
you're saying something like this
because using energy to define kinetic
energy isn't helping anything well this
question has a short answer the short
answer is I don't know what energy is
but luckily I know what energy does if
you've had enough of this philosophical
mumbo jumbo why don't we go ahead and
actually solve some problems so we have
this idea this work energy theorem it
says that the total work done none
object is equal to its change in kinetic
energy and since this is the equation
for kinetic energy well the change is
just this VF means final velocity and VI
means initial velocity so why don't we
solve a problem that we've solved
previously using motion considerations
but this time let's solve it using the
work energy theorem so I want to know
what is the balls final velocity if it's
dropped from rest you can enter your
answer here and I know I haven't
actually shown you how to use this
equation yet but you might be able to
figure it out just by looking here and
if you can I think you still have the
skills to answer this question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
