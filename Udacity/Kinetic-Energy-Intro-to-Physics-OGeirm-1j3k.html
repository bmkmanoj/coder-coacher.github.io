MV squared
I hope that right now you're seething I
hope you're riding in your chair and
saying Andy that's not what kinetic
energy is that's an equation that
describes kinetic energy what is kinetic
energy Oh what is kinetic energy well
it's the energy associated with motion
well I hope now you're saying something
like this because using energy to define
kinetic energy isn't helping anything
well this question has a short answer
the short answer is I don't know what
energy is but luckily I know what energy
does if you've had enough of this
philosophical mumbo jumbo why don't we
go ahead and actually solve some
problems so we have this idea this
work-energy theorem it says that the
total work done on object is equal to
its change in kinetic energy and since
this is the equation for kinetic energy
well the change is just this VF means
final velocity and VI means initial
velocity so why don't we solve a problem
that we've solved previously using
motion considerations but this time
let's solve it using the work-energy
theorem so I want to know what is the
ball's final velocity if it's dropped
from rest you can enter your answer here
and I know I haven't actually shown you
how to use this equation yet but you
might be able to figure it out just by
looking here and if you can I think you
still have the skills to answer this
