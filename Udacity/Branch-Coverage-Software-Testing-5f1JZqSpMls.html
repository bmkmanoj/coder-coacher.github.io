talked about statement coverage which is
closely related to line coverage but
it's a bit more fine-grained and let's
talk about what is probably the only
other test coverage metric that will
matter in your day-to-day life unless
you go build avionics software so branch
coverage is a metric we're a branch in
the code is covered if it executes both
ways
so for example to get 100% branch
coverage for the statement that tests
whether X is zero it would be needed to
be executed in a state where X was zero
and also in a state where X was not
equal to zero and so in many cases
branch coverage and statement coverage
have the same effect for example if our
code only contained if-then-else loops
the metrics would be equivalent on the
other hand for Cosel code like this
that's missing the else branches they're
not quite equivalent but we can take as
inputs to this code x equals to 0 and y
is minus 1 these inputs were sufficient
to get 100% statement coverage on the
other hand these are not sufficient to
get 100% branch coverage so what happens
is these cause the taken branch of the
if to be executed but not the else
branch and then the taken branch of the
second if to be executed but not the
else branch so they're different ways to
score a branch coverage but one way we
can do it is there are two ways to take
this branch two ways to take this branch
so we could say this is 50% branch
coverage the other thing we could do
however is do what our Python module for
counter coverage is going to do we could
say that both of these branches were
partially executed that is to say one of
their possibilities was realized during
testing no no branches were completely
missed and no branches were totally
covered and so let's go ahead and see
how our coverage module tells us this
all right so as you see here I've typed
into an editor window the same code that
I wrote down at my hand on the left part
of the slide and so we're going to
invoke the function foo with X being 0
and Y being minus 1 and let's see what
happens so we're going to run this under
the coverage tool but this time we're
going to give the coverage run command
an argument - - branch and that simply
tells it to measure branch coverage
instead of just measuring statement
coverage so it's again going to render
some HTML as the result and if we look
at the output it's going to tell us that
out of six statements all six of them
were wrong and there are zero missing
statements so with the statement level
we've achieved 100% coverage on the
other hand
at the branch level we had two branches
that were partially executed that is to
say only one of their two possibilities
was realized during execution so now if
we change this a little bit by crawling
through a second time with zero and - to
run the coverage tool again what we'll
see is is that the second branch the
test of Y now is executed both ways on
the other hand the first branch the one
that tests X still is is partially
executed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
