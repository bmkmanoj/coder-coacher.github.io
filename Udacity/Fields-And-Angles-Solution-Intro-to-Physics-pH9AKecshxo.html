positively charged particle so for this
positively charged particle we know
there are two forces acting on it
there's this horizontal force pulling it
towards the negative charge and there's
this vertical force pulling it along the
electric field and we know that when we
add these two vectors together we get a
net force vector that makes this angle
theta one with the horizontal and using
our knowledge of trigonometry we can
conclude that the tangent of this angle
theta 1 must be equal to the force
caused by the electric field / the force
pulling the positive charge towards the
negative charge and it turns out i can
write a similar equation for the
negatively charged particle so now i'm
going to take these two equations and
divide this equation by this equation
and doing that division I get this
equation here now in order to clean
things up a bit here we need to make one
key observation we know from Newton's
third law that when this positive charge
pulls on this negative charge that the
negative charge pulls back on a positive
charge with an identical force this
means that these horizontal forces must
be exactly the same so we can actually
cancel out these two force terms here
this gives us that the ratio of the
tangents between the two angles is equal
to the ratio between the forces the two
particles feel from the electric field
and we can always write the forces
particles feel from an electric field as
just the electric field strength times
the charge on those particles and we see
here that the electric field strength
will cancel leaving just the ratio of
the two charges this means that the
ratio of the charges on the two
particles is exactly equal to the ratio
of the tangents of the angles that the
net force vectors make with the
horizontal that's pretty cool and
plugging in mine own values for these
angles here I can calculate the ratio of
these two tangents and this gives me
that the ratio between these two charges
is about equal to 9 if you're able to
get this great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
