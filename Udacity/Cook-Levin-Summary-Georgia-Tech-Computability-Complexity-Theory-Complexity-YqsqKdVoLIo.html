satisfiability is np-complete but before
making the final arguments I want to
remind you of what we're trying to do
consider some language in NP and suppose
the tumin wants to be able to determine
whether strings are in this language the
cook-levin theorem argues that because L
is an NP there's a non-deterministic
Turing machine that decides it and it
uses this fact to create a function
computable in polynomial time
that takes in any input string X and
outputs a boolean formula that is
satisfiable if and only if the string X
is in the language L that way any
polynomial algorithm for deciding
satisfiability would be able to decide
every language in NP in polynomial time
only two questions remain is the
reduction correct and is it polynomial
in the size of the input let's consider
correctness first if X is in the
language then clearly the output formula
is satisfiable we can just use the truth
assignment that corresponds to an
accepting computation of the
non-deterministic Turing machine that
accepts X that will satisfy the formula
F that much is certainly true how about
the other direction does the formula
being satisfiable imply the X's in the
language take some satisfying assignment
for F as we've argued the corresponding
tableau is well-defined only one of the
state variables can be true at any time
etc the tableau also starts in the
initial configuration every transition
is valid and the configuration sequence
ends in an accepting state that's all
that's needed for a non-deterministic
Turing machine to accept so yes this
direction is true as well now we have to
argue that the reduction is polynomial
now we have to argue that the reduction
is polynomial first I claim that the
running time is polynomial in the output
formula length there just isn't much
calculation to be done besides iterating
over the combination of steps head
position states and Tate symbols and
printing out the Associated terms of the
formula second I claims the output
formula is polynomial in the input
length let's go back and count these
clauses pertaining to the states require
order P of n times log n string length
the number of states of the machine is a
constant in this context the P factor
comes from the number of steps of
machine the for all I here the log n
factor comes from the fact that we have
to distinguish the literals from one
another this requires log n bits in fact
in all these calculations that's where
the log factor comes from for the head
position we have order P of n cubed log
n string length one factor of P comes
from the number of steps and we have to
coming from all pairs of head positions
there are order P squared combinations
of steps and squares so this family of
clauses requires order P squared log in
length as well the size of the alphabet
is a constant in this context as for the
constraints pertaining to the initial
configuration these require order P log
n string length the dominant factor
being the constraints about the contents
of the tape in the constraint that the
computation be accepting requires only
log n string length since it just has to
write out this single literal one clause
here the transition clauses might seem
like they would require a high order
polynomial of symbols but remember that
the size the non-deterministic Turing
machine is a constant in this context
therefore the fact that we might have to
write out clauses for all pairs of
states and tape symbols doesn't affect
the asymptotic analysis only the range
of the indices I and J depend on the
size of the input string so we end up
with order P squared log and string
length for all these transition clauses
summing the length of all those clauses
up together
we have a sum of polynomials which is of
course a polynomial so yes the overall
reduction is a polynomial and cook's
theorem is proved</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
