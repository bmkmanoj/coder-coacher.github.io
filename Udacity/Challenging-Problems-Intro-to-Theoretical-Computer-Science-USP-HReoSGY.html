challenging problems first off I should
probably start by telling you what a
challenging problem actually is normally
this situation is as follows when you
want to solve a problem with a computer
you write some program on your computer
to tell it what you want to do with a
certain input then you take your input
you feed it into the computer and the
computer will work on your problems so
it'll probably tell you to wait if
you've written your program like this
might make some noises and after certain
time the computer will be done and it
will produce your output now you would
think that computers today are powerful
enough to basically do this for any
problem for which you can write a
program but you might already know that
sometimes this is not the case so
sometimes problems are so challenging to
solve even for a computer even for a
very very fast computer that you will
not get the output instead all what will
happen is that the computer will tell
you to wait might make noises again and
it will keep on telling you to wait
might make more noise because it's
working so hard but no matter how long
you wait the computer is not able to
produce an output because the problem
that you're giving it is just too hard
even for computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
