figuring out how much work 65 kilogram
Andy has to do to climb this flight of
stairs
that 6 metres tall so let's think about
what's going on here in terms of energy
so Andy starts and ends with no kinetic
energy so none of his net work is going
to contribute towards kinetic energy but
because Andy ends at a higher height
than he started that means he has more
gravitational potential energy up here
than he did down here and this just
means that the net work done by Andy is
equal to the change in his potential
energy and this of course is just equal
to the final potential energy - the
original potential energy and if we
choose potential energy to be zero at
the bottom of the stairs we can say that
the original potential energy when he's
at the bottom of the stairs is equal to
zero
this leaves just the final potential
energy term which we know is equal to mg
times the final height and plugging in
all my values here
I find that andy has to do 3,900 joules
of work to climb this 6 metre flight of
stairs great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
