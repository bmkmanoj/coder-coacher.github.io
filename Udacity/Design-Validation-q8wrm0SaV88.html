to design is how they are validated as I
just said typically that means some kind
of review walkthrough inspection by a
team it could also be the case of the
tools that you're using to represent the
design can do some checking for you some
issues arise with design validation and
a key one is the Independence of the
validators the problem here is that if
you have the design team doing its own
validation they may be blinded to
particular issues if they didn't think
about them when they were doing the
design they may not think about them
when they're inspecting the design
bringing in independent validators can
help with the effectiveness of the
design review second issue that arises
is the dependence of the design
validation on the design method for
structured design there's a complete set
of rules associated metrics with each of
the design artifacts on the class
resource page there's some guidelines
that i've written up concerning the
things that you can ask about during a
object-oriented design review a third
key issue with validation is when do you
do it one strategy is to do it as you go
along that is on a daily or weekly basis
review what you have and make
adjustments an alternative is to wait
until you get to major milestones have
design reviews and make your changes at
that point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
