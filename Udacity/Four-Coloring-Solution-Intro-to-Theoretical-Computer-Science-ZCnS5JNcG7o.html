intuitively is we're going to add a new
vertex to the graph and then we're going
to add an edge from all of the current
vertices in the graph to the new vertex
and well then we're simply going to
return the result of graph is for
colorable of this new graph so we
construct a new graph which is just an
empty list in this case and then for
every node in the original graph we add
in an additional one since this is an
adjacency matrix that means that there
is an additional vertex that every
single node in this graph is connected
to like I've just said we're going to
append this new node to each row in the
adjacency matrix then we're going to
append a column of ones at the end of
this graph of the adjacency matrix and
this represents the vertex that is
connected to every other vertices which
is what we've just constructed and then
we take this new graph and we simply run
it through graph is for colorable so we
have reduced the three colorable problem
to the four colorable problem and by the
definition of np-completeness that means
that for the four colorable problem is
also NP complete</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
