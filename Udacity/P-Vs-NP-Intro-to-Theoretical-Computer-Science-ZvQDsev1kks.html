Alice Bob and Carol were stuck with at
the end of the previous unit was that
they had only been able to find
exponential time algorithms for these
three problems here and those algorithms
did not show any acceptable running time
so the question they were stuck with is
did they just not think hard enough to
find good algorithms for their problems
or are there problems intractable which
would mean that it's not even possible
or at least highly unlikely to find a
polynomial time algorithm for those
problems and this is what we'll
investigate further in this unit and I'm
not yet going to reveal the answer to
you but what I am going to tell you is
that without realizing it by asking this
question if their problems are tractable
or intractable Alice Bob and Carol are
currently pondering what is by many seen
as one of the toughest questions in
computer science the famous P versus NP
problem and in this unit I want to show
you four things first what these letters
mean second what the problem is actually
all about so what this here means third
what Alice Bob and Carol have actually
to do with a P versus NP problem and
then last but not least how you could
become an instant millionaire that's not
bad for one unit is it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
