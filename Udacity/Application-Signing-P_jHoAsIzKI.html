signed before they can be installed on
device the actual cryptography and math
of how the signing process works is
utterly fascinating but also kind of
beyond the scope of this course
digitally signing an app accomplishes
two things first it allows Google and
users who download the app to verify the
identity of developer that published it
second it guarantees that the app hasn't
been tampered with since it was signed
quite simply signing is required for
apps on the Play Store so that users can
be sure that the app they are
downloading was indeed published by the
listed developer it also protects you as
a developer so that no one else can
publish an app under your name Gradle
automatically signs debug applications
with a special debug key that allows our
app to installed on development devices
however apps sign with a debug key can't
be published to the Play Store in order
to sign an app we first need to generate
a key this key will be unique to you and
should be used to sign all of your apps
we will also create a key store which is
just a special type of database that we
keep our key in Android studio makes
creating key stores and generating keys
incredibly simple let's take a look at
how this is done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
