for resources is intellectual property
and there are great law firms who can
give you tutorials there's plenty of
stuff on the web but the types of
intellectual property shorthand IP you
want to think about are these there are
five one is trademark and trademark
means what can you protect is branding
like the Nike swoosh and the examples
could be marks or logos or slogans other
type of intellectual property could be
copyright an example is creative or
authored works and expressions you can't
copyright ideas but you can copyright
software or songs or movies or website
content the other one has trade secrets
well I don't want to patent this because
somebody's gonna read the patent they'll
figure it out so you might decide that
you're gonna protect it in a vault just
like the coca-cola recipe is supposedly
kept in a vault in Atlanta and it's
non-public technology also your customer
lists might kind of fit in this category
or some secret formulas necessary for
our final element in your product two
things that startups run into all the
time are contracts or ndas which stands
for non-disclosure agreements you know
what's protectable is in the contract
that is you specify it or somebody
making you sign it or offering you a
contractor an NDA specifies it and
examples are technology and business
information now by the way before we go
forward this is one point I want to
mention founders sometimes naively
believe that they could protect their
technology from investors or potential
investors by making investors sign a
nondisclosure agreement that just
doesn't happen and it's a naive view of
how to protect your technology
my suggestion is by the way don't put
your source code your firmware or or
your deep insight in the first
presentation because you're never gonna
have somebody push a bag of money at you
across the table over a series of
PowerPoint slides in fact if an investor
is interested in your now in meeting 2 3
or 4 and they say listen for us to
really proceed we need to have you open
the hood and let us our consultant take
a look for the next question to ask is
well if we do that and it meets these
following krei
tyria is there an investment or not and
if the answer is yes then you can make
them or at least require an NDA because
they've gone down the path of interest
with you in our series the last piece of
intellectual property is patent the US
patent law has changed in some important
ways in the last year if you were
familiar with it it's nice to get
updated again what's protectable our
inventions and typical examples are new
technologies you've invented something
new some hardware or algorithm or
software etc getting a patent is kind of
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
