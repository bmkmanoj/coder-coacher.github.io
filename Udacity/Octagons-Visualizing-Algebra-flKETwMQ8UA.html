that's great i know i have three entire
octagons and then i need to figure out
this faction this is actually going to
be three fourths let's see why I could
have split my octagons into eighths so I
know I have three whole octagon and then
i have 1 82 83 84 85 86 eighths of a
hexagon remember i know i could reduce
68 I know two goes into six and eight so
i can simplify it and then i have three
fourths to find our improper fraction we
just need to count up all the Apes if i
count it up all the AIDS i would find
out that i would have 30 / 8 or 38
remember i can reduce this fraction so I
get 15 / 4 or fifteen fourths but this
doesn't quite make sense my picture has
eights but my answers have fourths well
that means I could actually have done
this a little bit differently I could
have split up my octagons into fourths
this would be one fourth of the Octagon
notice when I have force I can easily
see that i have three and three fourths
I have three whole hexagons and then i
have 3 41 42 43 force of this last
hexagon so three and three fours County
the improper fractions is pretty easy
too I can actually just use my mixed
number because this mixed number is in
force I can figure out the improper
fraction in fourths i can multiply 4
times 3 which is 12 that makes sense
because i have three octagons into each
of them has four pieces then I have to
add three more pieces so I add 12 plus 3
and I get 15 / for fifteen fourths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
