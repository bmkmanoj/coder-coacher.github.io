by itself before we do anything else we
need to subtract 23 from both sides that
leaves us with three e to the x equals
323 to get e to the X alone all we need
to do now is to divide both sides by 3
now I could come up with a decimal for
the right hand side here but I don't
think it's going to be very pretty so
I'm just going to leave this as an
improper fraction for now so we have e
to the x equals 323 over 3 now I want to
get X by itself and what do I need to do
well I need to take the log of both
sides and the base of that log needs to
be the same as the base we have here
which is e so I have Ln of e to the x
equals Ln of 323 over 3 we know that the
left hand side will reduce just 2x
that's why we picked a log of this base
after all to figure out what the right
hand side evaluates to we have to use
our calculator okay so natural log of
323 / 3 double check that we've entered
the correct thing here and that looks
right to me that equals four point six
seven nine and so on they said we wanted
our answer just to two decimal places so
that should be four point six eight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
