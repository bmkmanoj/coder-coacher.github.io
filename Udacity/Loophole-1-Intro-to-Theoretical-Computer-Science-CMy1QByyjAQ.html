np-completeness and the laws of
np-completeness of course is a book that
only holds unless P equals NP if anybody
have approved P equals NP then we can
recycle this book here or delete the
e-book so what do the laws of
np-completeness say they say no
polynomial time algorithm so now it's
time to think like lawyers and try to
put loopholes into this statement here
and there's two loopholes that you can
poke into this one is that we only say
no polynomial time we do not say
exponential time what do I mean by that
well what about a running time like 2 to
the power of the square root of n it's
not exponential time it's called sub
exponential because you don't have the N
as it is appear on the exponent but it's
also not polynomial time because you
have some function of n up here in the
exponent a running time like this
actually conforms with the law and it
has an excellent speed at so let's think
about this for a minute let's say N
equals 50 if N equals 50 what is the
speed up of 2 to the power of the square
root of n versus 2 to the power of n of
course we're going to do this as a quiz
is it over a million is it over a
billion or is it over a trillion of
course I only want you to select one
answer here the best possible one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
