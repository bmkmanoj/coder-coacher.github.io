there are lots and lots of ways to solve
this so we're going to define a
procedure and its input is the number n
and what we want to do is compute this
function we're going to compute n times
n minus 1 times n minus 2 so we're going
to need a variable to keep track of the
result as we go as well as a variable to
keep track of how many times we go so
we're going to define a procedure that
computes the factorial of n what we need
to do is multiply all these numbers so
we're going to have a variable that
keeps track of the results so far and
we'll start by initializing that to one
so we'll call that result and we'll set
its initial value to one and we're going
to keep multiplying by n until we get to
the end so we're going to have our while
loop where the test condition is as long
as n is greater than or equal to one so
we're going to start with n is the value
that was passed in we're going to
subtract 1 each time we go through the
loop until we get down to 1 and keep
updating the result so the result keeps
updating so we want the result to be the
previous result times n we also have to
change the value of n to keep reducing
and as we go so we subtract 1 from n
every time through the loop the result
is multiplied by the current value of n
n is decreased by 1 we keep going until
we get to N is equal to 1 we're not
quite done yet we want to return a
result and the very the value that we
want is stored in this variable result
so we return results here so let's try
that in the Python interpreter so now
we'll see what happens when we have the
input for our child playing with blocks
and we see the result is 24 there are 24
different ways to arrange the four
blocks factorials increase pretty
quickly so we could also use the
factorial procedure to figure out the
number of different ways to arrange a
deck of playing cards if we have a deck
with 50 cards there are 52 ways to pick
the first card 51 ways to pick the
second and so forth and when we run this
we see that the factorial of 52 is this
really big number that's why you can
have so many different card games every
time you play the arrangement of the
cards is going to be different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
