things we would need to build an
application like a real estate listing
site first we need to point out
locations on the map we're going to
start off by mapping our listings using
lat long coordinates we'll learn how to
get coordinates from addresses later in
the course in order to keep is simple
we'll just make one point on our map at
first we fin our initialized function
we're going to create one lat long we'll
use the syntax seen here which is
creating a lat long literal object this
point is in Tribeca next how do we make
it appear on the map we can use a little
universally recognized icon called a
marker markers are objects which can be
constructed either in the initialize
function or upon an action like clicking
a button let's create a super simple
marker showing our first listing at this
point in Tribeca we're creating a new
marker instance using the google map
marker object all the marker needs to
know is the map that it should appear on
and where it should appear which is our
point that we just created we'll also
give the marker a title which will
appear if we hover over the marker there
are a bunch more things that we could
specify we could make it draggable so
that when it appears the user can move
it around we could specify an animation
so that it doesn't just appear on the
map it drops for example let's test this
out there's our marker but a point on a
map doesn't do us much good we have to
tell the user is what they're looking at
let's check out how to display some
information about the marker next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
