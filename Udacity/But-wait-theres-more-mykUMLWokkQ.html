for the same asset can vary widely
depending on how frequently you sample
it so in other words if you sample the
prices every year and compute your
Sharpe ratio based on yearly statistics
you'll get one number if you sample
monthly you'll get a different number if
you sample daily you'll get still
another number the original vision for
the Sharpe ratio is that it's an annual
measure and so if we're sampling at
frequencies other than annually we need
to add an adjustment factor to make it
all work out so if we have our original
Sharpe ratio over here we multiply it by
an adjustment factor called K to get the
annualized version now what is K K is
simply the square root of the number of
samples per year so for instance if
we're using daily data there are 252
trading days per year so K is a square
root of 250 - if we're say taking weekly
samples it'd be square root of 52
important thing to keep in mind is the
number in here is the rate at which
we're sampling so as an example let's
suppose we were trading for 85 days
because we're sampling at a daily rate
we use this number for our K square root
of 252 even though we only trade it for
89 days we use 252 here because we're
sampling daily it's the frequency at
which we sample that affects this value
for K so recapping if we sample the
value of our portfolio monthly K is
square root of 12 if we do it weekly its
square root of 52 because there's 52
weeks in a year and if we sample daily
its square root of 252 bringing it all
together if we're using daily data our
Sharpe ratio is square root of 252
that's our K times mean of our daily
returns
- the daily risk-free rate divided by
standard deviation of daily returns</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
