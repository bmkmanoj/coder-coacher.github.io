by calling an access method on the chart
object since our x-axis represents ears
we use the add time access method and
specify that the x-axis should
correspond to the year field of our data
let's finish this by adding a semicolon
which is not only a good JavaScript best
practice but in some cases your code
will run into errors if you don't
include one after every line and add an
access to our chart previously we try to
inspect my chart and it was quite hard
to understand well all the methods and
properties meant but let's inspect our
x-axis if we look here it's a dimple
access object and it specified the chart
it belongs to the position in this case
the x-axis and also what fields it
corresponds to something to note here
that the chart property define our axis
actually is a reference to the chart
object we create earlier rather than
just an identifier string we try
printing out what this chart object is X
cart we get the same object as we got
when we printed out my chart as you can
see here they're both dimple dot chart
objects and they both have all of the
same properties now this is possible
even if two objects aren't identical but
if they have the same properties defined
going one step farther we can actually
compare the my chart object with the
triple equals to X dot chart in this
case it says my chart is exactly equal
to the axis chart property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
