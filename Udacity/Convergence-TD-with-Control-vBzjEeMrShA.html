not too bad I'm very excited because
today we get to talk about TD with
control okay is that what that yellow
thing is that's intended to be a
lightning bolt I don't know somehow it
is convergent TD with control sounded
like a superhero movie to me okay that
makes perfect sense so why are you
excited about this well so what we're
going to talk about is how to not just
learn values using update rules like TD
but to actually learn the values of
different actions that we might take as
a way of figuring out the right way to
behave okay I like that and and and
we'll even get really close to proving
that these methods converge that is to
say that given enough data over enough
time they actually do the right thing
okay by the way did you know that a
convergence is the name of the 2015
company-wide event in DC Comics whoa
okay so it is a superhero thing yeah
well done does that mean we get paid for
using their stuff or does that mean that
we have to pay for using their stuff I
think it means that we have to pay them
so oh whoops time to raise tuition can't
do that there you go now everything's
taken care of tada</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
