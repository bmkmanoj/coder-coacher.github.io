he used an inclined plane to roll balls
for the purpose of slowing down the
motion and we know we used a water clock
to measure time even though this water
clock couldn't measure seconds he didn't
know that the time this clock measured
was proportional to the amount of water
collected in this collecting device so
if you collected this much water in your
first experiment and twice as much water
in your second experiment you know that
the second experiment took twice as long
so how did he do the actual experiment
first you would roll the ball for one
unit of time and a unit here is to find
a some specified amount of water he
would let the ball roll and then measure
the distance so maybe after one unit of
time the ball had gone from here to here
so how did Galileo do his experiment
well he would allow the ball to roll for
one unit of time where a unit of time
was a specified amount of water and he
would measure the distance this distance
he would call one unit of distance let's
say so if the ball rolled from here to
here in one unit of time this became one
unit of distance notice that Galileo
wasn't really concerned with whether
these units were seconds or minutes or
meters or inches he was looking for
proportions and in proportions these
units always cancel out so Galileo
really didn't care about these things
after he did that for one unit of time
he would allow the ball to roll for two
units of time and then measure the
distance and again for three and four
and so on he'd keep doing this for three
units of time for five and so on and
when he was done he would repeat the
entire experiment many many times
because more data means you can reduce
your error and we'll talk about that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
