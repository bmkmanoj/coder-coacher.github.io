anywhere by adding a jazz color to her
plot but I want to let you know that
that's okay sometimes when we conduct
exploratory data analysis we do reach
dead ends let's see if we can get any
further and examining our relationship
between friend count and age by adding
the third variable previously we noted
that female users have more friends on
average than male users and we might
wonder is this just because female users
have a different age distribution or
maybe conditional and age the
differences are actually larger here's a
box plot of ages by gender now I'm going
to add the mean for each gender to the
box plots using stat summary here we can
see the average is marked by an X since
I used shape equals four since male
users are a bit younger
we might actually think a simple male to
female comparison doesn't capture the
substantial differences in friend count
let's look at median friend count by age
and gender instead a lot of this code
should look familiar and if it doesn't I
want you to post any questions that you
have about it in a discussion when I run
this code we can see that nearly
everywhere
the median friend count is larger for
women than it is for men now there are
some exceptions and this includes these
noisy estimates for our very old users
now I'm using old with quotation marks
here since we're not really confident
about these reported ages I notice that
users reporting to be 70 have more or
less the same friend count regardless of
reported gender you're going to
reproduce the same plot but first let's
see if you can create the summary data
to create it
recall that we can produce the same
summary data under lioness plot by using
the D plier package we can divide the
data by age and gender and then compute
the median and Mead friend count for
each subgroup in this next programming
assignment you're going to do just that
by using the group by summarize and
arrange functions from the deep liar
package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
