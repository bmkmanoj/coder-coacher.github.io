some really fundamental information then
about how to find zeros and curves
without breaks in them we just need to
look for regions of the graph where y
values switch from being positive to be
negative or from being negative to being
positive in either case the curve must
have at least one x-intercept somewhere
in that region that we're looking at
this is pretty general information
though and the intermediate value
theorem can actually help us even more
in fact Athena used it on the train in a
very clever way one day Athena needed to
catch the train in mountain view she had
been visiting the Udacity office for the
afternoon now to find out what time her
train will leave she called her brother
Niko's all he could tell her was that
the train would come to Mountain View
sometime between 4pm and 6pm this
information wasn't quite accurate enough
for Athena she wanted to be able to plan
her afternoon a bit more precisely so
she looked up the schedule for the train
much to Athena's disappointment somehow
the one departure time that was missing
from the train schedule was the time
that the train would leave mountain view
it had the times for every other stop
listed and the stops are written in
order here just like we saw on the map
earlier starting in San Jose and then
moving north along the track based on
the schedule Athena knows a window of
time within which the train will leave
from Mountain View what is that window</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
