access mm-hmm I'm just thinking about
the gift shopping i'll be doing during
my vacation Hawaii I'm not sure how my
cell network access is going to be out
there and it'd be really good to not
lose all my shopping list data when the
internet connection is flaky well I
guess it's a fair point but I don't know
the more I think about it the more
tricky it sounds like it'd be to set up
so first of all you need to be cashing
the data locally somewhere which would
necessitate using may be a sequel like
database or something like that you'd
also be needing to cache kind of the
stuff that the user does when the app is
offline so say you were to buy I don't
know some tiki masks or something
offline it would that need to send that
data that you bought that to the phone
when you reconnect and frankly we just
don't have the engineering resources
right now to even start implementing
that firebase is actually doing some
caching by default as well as cueing any
actions your user makes offline hmm well
actually that's awesome in that case
don't we just get offline access for
free some of the time okay well I'm
wrapped up in important business
decisions so maybe you can talk to the
developer about all that offline stuff
sure you do know your camera is on right
now yes yes it is okay let's talk a
little about how firebase deals with
offline access and data in general and
what you get free we have two clients
your phone and my phone for example and
let's say my phone isn't connected maybe
I put my phone into airplane mode but i
still have shopping list plus plus up on
my device in this situation my client
keeps a local cache this includes all
the data that was in the app the last
time I had access I can keep making
changes and see them immediately in
actuality every client of a firebase app
maintains its own version of active data
and changes made to this local copy of
the database trigger actions locally
first before data gets written to the
server so it's not just a matter of it
works offline it's
by design anyway when I am connected
again the app will get updated based on
the changes I made offline in that
situation my client will push the
correct events to the server the ones i
made offline and i will get the changes
from the server based on the changes you
made this is what you get for free with
firebase</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
