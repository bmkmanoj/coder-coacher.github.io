rays have a d' type which is the type of
each element in the array for example
the d type of this array is in 64 in 64
means a 64-bit integer now this also
applies to two-dimensional arrays each
element in the array is expected to have
the same type this can make it
inconvenient to use two-dimensional
numpy arrays to represent the contents
of a CSV file for example suppose I
tried to create a numpy array to
represent the student enrollment data
from Watson 1 I've recreated a small
piece of that data here even though when
I created the array
I entered integers and bullying's
without quotes each element has been
converted to a string the D type is also
s14 meaning strings of length at most 14
obviously it doesn't make sense to take
the mean of strings such as canceled but
it would make sense to take the mean of
just the days to cancel column the days
to cancel column is column 3 so I can
access it like this however if I take
the mean of this column then it doesn't
work instead numpy says that it cannot
perform the reduce with a flexible type
which means that it doesn't know how to
take the mean when not all of the values
are numbers that's one benefit of pandas
dataframes
over two-dimensional numpy arrays a data
frame is also a 2-dimensional data
structure but each column is assumed to
be a different type another benefit is
that data frames have indexes similar to
pandas series there is an index value
for each row and a name for each column
so instead I'll create a panda's data
frame from this data I can do that by
passing in a dictionary mapping column
names to lists of values for that column
so one key in the dictionary would be a
count key and the list would be all of
the values for the account key column
and similarly for the other columns now
when I take a look at the data frame
it's displayed in a nice table the
column names are at the top and the row
index is our integers starting at 0
there are some other ways to create
pandas data frames as well which you'll
take a look at soon now if I take the
mean of the data frame it takes the mean
of each numerical column and ignores the
others this udacity is a numerical
column here
crews treated as one and falses treated
as 0
you'll notice that pandas did not take
the mean of the entire data frame here
but of each column since each column is
assumed to be a different type this
makes more sense for pandas you can also
use the axis argument to take the mean
of each row instead although that won't
work in this case since each row
contains some non numerical data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
