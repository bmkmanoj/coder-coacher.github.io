gonna have to relate this new force the
force of gravity within the Earth's
surface to a force were more familiar
with this Hookes law force the force
exerted by a spring so we know that with
springs the period is equal to 2 pi
times the square root of the mass over
the spring constant K but in this
problem we don't have a spring constant
we don't have a value for K but you'll
note that by comparing our two equations
here we can actually find something in
this equation that looks a lot like K in
this equation the role of K is played by
little g times m over the radius of the
earth so we can call this new collection
of constants K G where K G stands for
our new spring constant with respect to
this gravitational force so now we can
rewrite our equation for the force of
gravity within the earth as F equals K G
times the radius and now this equation
looks exactly like this equation and we
can tell what the value of K and this
equation for period should be we should
just use our kg value ok so now i can
use this value of k ji GM over re as the
value of K in my period equation like so
and quite pleasantly the mass terms here
cancel and this gives me this final
equation for the period of a person
oscillating through the center of the
earth that the period is equal to 2 pi
times the square root of G over the
radius of the earth and I know all the
values here and plugging in all those
numbers I find that the period of this
oscillation is equal to eighty three
point eight minutes if you are able to
get this value congratulations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
