round two every processor has heard from
every other processor in the entire
system right so you can see eyeball this
figure you can see that every process
has gotten a message from every other
processor and so it's common knowledge
that for every processor that everyone
else has also arrived at the barrier so
how many rounds does it take to know
that everybody has arrived at the
barrier
well it's sealing off log n to the base
2 and receiving because it's n need not
be a part of 2 so at this point
everybody is awake so barrier completion
here there is no distinction between
arrival and wake up as you saw in the
case of the tree barrier or the MCS
barrier the tournament barrier in the
dissemination barrier because it is
happening by information diffusion at
the end of a ceiling of log n rounds
everybody has heard from everyone else
in the entire system so everyone knows
that barrier has been reached so in
other words in every round of
communication in the dissimulation
barrier every processor you I ball any
particular processor every processor is
receiving exactly one message exactly
one message in every round of this
dissemination barrier and so overall
during the entire dissemination barrier
information diffusion that's going on
every processor is receiving a total of
a ceiling of log n to the base 2
messages every round one message and so
there are ceiling of log n rounds and so
ceiling of log n to the base 2 is the
number of messages that any given
processor is receiving and once every
processor has received this ceiling
login to the base 2 number of messages
it knows that batting is complete it can
move on and I've been using the word
message in describing this dissemination
barrier it is convenient to use that
word because it is information diffusion
but if you think about a shared memory
machine a message is basically a spin
location and once again because I know
an ordained processor
going to talk to me in every run the
spin location for this guy is statically
determined spin location statically
determine and so on so every round of
the tournament we can statically
determine the spin location that a
particular processor has to wait on in
order to receive a message which is
really a signal from its ordained peer
for that particular round of the
dissemination barrier so again static
determination of spin location becomes
extremely important if the
multiprocessor happens to be an NCC Numa
machine in that case what you want to do
is to locate the spin location in the
memory that is closest to the particular
processor so that becomes more efficient
and as always in every one of these
barrier algorithms you have to do sense
reversal that once this barrier is
complete everybody is going on to to the
next phase of the computation and when
they go to the next phase of the
computation they have to make sure that
the barrier that they arrive is the next
barrier so you need sense reversal that
needs to happen at the end of everybody
an algorithm so now let's talk about
some of the virtues of the dissimulation
barrier
the first thing that you'll notice is in
the structure there is no hierarchy in
the tree algorithms the root of the tree
automatically gives you a hierarchy in
terms of the organization of the tree in
the dissimulation barrier there is no
such thing and I already mentioned that
this algorithm works for both NCC Numa
machine as well as clusters that's also
a good thing and there is no waiting on
anybody else so every processor is
independently making a decision to send
a message as soon as it arrives at the
barrier it's ready to send a message to
its peer for that particular run and of
course every processor can move to the
next round only after it has received a
corresponding message from its peer for
this particular run so as soon as that
happens you can move on to the next
round of the dissemination barrier and
all the processors will realize that the
barrier is complete when they've
received ceiling login messages in the
entire structure of this algorithm so if
you think about the total amount of
communication because the communication
in every round is fixed
it's end messages and every Ron and
since there are ceiling login rounds the
the communication complexity of this
algorithm is order n log n compare this
that to the communication complexity of
the tournament or the the tree barrier
in both of those cases the communication
complexity was only log n because of the
hierarchy as you go towards the root of
the tree the amount of communication
shrinks so the amount of communication
in those algorithms is only order of log
n whereas in this dissimulation barrier
since there is no hierarchy the total
amount of communication in the algorithm
is order of n log N</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
