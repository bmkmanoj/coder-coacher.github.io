with animated vectors let's walk through
an example of implementing them we'll
return to this tic to cross animation we
looked at and implement him the first
step is to create two vector drawables
one for the tic and one for the cross
here on my draw balls I'm generating the
paths using my favorite drawing graphics
package and then exporting the SVG and
grabbing the path data from it soon
Android studio will be able to import
SVG directly as a vector drawable a pro
tip that I found helpful is to create a
resources file to keep all of the
attributes of an animation together here
I'm calling it tip cross for example
we'll need to reference the path data
from a couple of different places so
saving it as a string resource and then
referencing it makes this easy next we
create animators for each of their steps
there changing here's an example that
morphs the ticks across see how it
references the strings we specified in
the resources as the from and to States
finally we create an animated vector
drawable which connects the image to the
animator for example this animated
vector drawable acts on the icy cross
vector drawable it targets one of the
par sections by name here the cross
paths and then specifies an animator to
run on it here running the cross to tick
animation we just looked at once we have
all of the moving parts together we can
show the drawable in an image view and
start the animation when appropriate
perhaps in response to an event like a
click you can find the full source code
to this demo linked in the instructors
notes fun details like this are a great
way to entertain your users and show
some personality in your app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
