we were just talking about we have
actually had these two different forms
of the bellman equation 1 V which we
could think of as standing for value and
1 Q which we can think of as standing
for quality but mostly they're just
letters from the end of the alphabet
that we made up names for so you you you
know you had you for utility this is V
for value and Q for quality but anyway
the point is that these are just
expressions that represent different
pieces of this overall sequence of
states and rewards and actions ok so I
got two questions one is why I mean why
are we bothering to create this quality
function when the value function worked
just fine thank you very much and my
second question well I'll ask the second
question after you give me a
satisfactory answer to the first one so
why so you know in some sense because
they're both equally good but in fact
what's going to turn out to be the case
is that this Q form of the bellman
equation is going to be much more useful
in the context of reinforcement learning
and the reason for that is we're going
to be able to take expectations of this
quantity using just experience data and
you don't need to actually have direct
access to the reward function or the
transition function to do that whereas
if we're gonna try to learn V values the
only way to connect one V value to the
to the next V value is by knowing the
transitions and rewards so this is going
to be really helpful in the context of
reinforcement learning where we don't
know the transitions of rewards in
advance um ok I'll buy that so here's my
second question then you've got D
function for what happens when you're at
a state you've got a cue function what
happens when you're at an action there's
at least one more thing in that infinite
stars are Char Char Char Char Char and
that's our hmm yes you're saying we can
group things this way or we can group
things this way so why can't we group
things this way um sure
that's what I'm asking because if we go
one step more than that then we're back
to the max again and that was our V
right so yeah that that seems to be the
the third member of our little trio
that's been left out so I think maybe we
should have a quiz about that of course
we should</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
