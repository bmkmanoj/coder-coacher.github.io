algorithm or sha the secure hash
algorithm was developed by nist the
original algorithm is sha-1 sha-1
produces a hash value of 160 bits later
NIST
revised the char standard and specify
the char two algorithms these algorithms
have key lengths of 256 284 and 512 bits
and their operations are similar to
sha-1 this table compares the char
parameters the message digest size
refers to the length of the hash value
so for sha-1 it is 160 bits
Vishal 512 the hash length is 512 bits
message size is a size limit on the
input you can consider these size limits
are not having effect in practice
because most if not all messages will be
smaller for example even with sha-1 the
message size is limited to 2 to 64 this
means that you can has a message so big
that it occupies the entire address
space of a 64-bit computer you can also
think about it in another way to to 243
bits is already a terabyte as we can see
the algorithms from left to right
produce hash values with more bits hence
they are more secure as we move from
left to right for example we shall 1
because the hash value has 160 bits then
the search space for the attacker to
find a collision is 280
well as for Shaw 512 the search space is
to 256 in this lecture we will provide a
description of sha-512 the other
versions are quite similar for sha-512
it takes as an input a message that's
smaller than 2 to the 128th again this
is not a limit that will have any impact
in practice the output is a hash value
that is in 512 bits the input is
processed block by block and each blog
has 1024 bits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
