to think about the database schema
remember to write your create table
statements in a file called tournament
SQL you'll be submitting this along with
your code as part of your final project
remember that after you've created your
database if you decide that you've made
a mistake you can always drop a table or
the whole database and recreate it and
if you need to clear out the data in a
table you can use delete remember that
drop table will remove the table
completely and you'll have to recreate
it using the create table command
whereas delete from that table will just
remove the rows leaving the column
definitions constraints and so forth
intact a few more things to keep in mind
when players are added to a tournament
the database should assign each player a
unique ID you've seen how to do that
using the serial type and there's an
extra credit option where you can extend
the project to support multiple
tournaments if you do that you'll want
unique IDs for those to second remember
that you can use SQL aggregations when
you want to count things or add them up
if you find yourself pulling lots of
rows from the database into your code
and then using Len to count them or
using a loop to add them up try doing
that in the database query instead last
if you notice your queries start to get
really complicated don't forget about
views views work nicely with
aggregations when you want to present
summary data quickly if you use views
make sure to put your create view
statements into tournament SQL along
with your create tables with that it's
time to get into designing your database
and writing your code on the next page
you'll find a full description of the
project and an outline of the functions
you'll be writing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
