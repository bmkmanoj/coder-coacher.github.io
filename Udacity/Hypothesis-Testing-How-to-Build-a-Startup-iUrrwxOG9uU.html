understand this what is it you're
actually doing out outside the building
and what I think about is you're really
testing on the highest possible level
your understanding of the customers
problem or need you implicitly had a
hypothesis I want to extract from
implicit to have you make explicit
here's what the pain and the gain we're
actually doing for these hypothetical
customer segments that I've written down
in my canvas great so how are we going
to go do that so literally we're going
to get out of the building take our
hypotheses and we're not just getting
out of the building and randomly talking
to customers because if that was the
case we could have just sent them a
letter or sent an email what we're
looking for is not just data is insights
and how this process of work is we'll
get out of the building and then as we
find those new insights we'll actually
change the canvas big idea we'll change
the canvas by marking it up and saying
you know we thought the customers were
these kinds of people holy cow they are
actually these kinds of people we
thought the features we need well
they're kind of different they're
actually these features so what you're
doing outside the building is you start
with these hypotheses in this case let's
just take an example the customers will
be male 24 to 35 live in urban areas and
then we're going to design some
experiments let's go figure out maybe a
Google AdWords campaign or if it was a
physical product go out and meet them
personally and then run some tests and
take a look and analyze the data but
it's not just the data we're trying to
understand did the results match the
hypotheses and if not just don't give up
and say well it didn't let's try another
segment understand why your initial
hypotheses were wrong because it says
why not that might give you some insight
so what you might find out in this case
is oops we kept getting teen girls in
suburbia and you could either keep
deciding no no I want men or you might
go well women the teen girls are
actually enthusiastic in fact paying
month trying to figure out how to buy a
product right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
