animators box perhaps the first one
learned the whole idea is this to
animate an object save its state at
various times and interpolate among
these for example I have an object I
want to move from one position to
another overtime at time a I record the
position in time at time be I do the
same when I want to run the animation
given a time I can get the position this
is a linear interpolation between
positions a and B the process of
generating these frames in between the
keyframes is called tweening we can do
the same thing with the drinking bird
interpolating between its two rotation
angles down and up right here's a set of
keyframes a and B and what we've shown
is the times that they occur since we
want a loop we give two keyframes and
then we go back and repeat aids the bird
in the down position about to go up B is
the bird in the up position about to go
down here's a timeline of our animation
we start with the bird down he goes up
over two seconds and then he goes back
down again over three seconds a is our
key frame for down B is our key frame
for up and they have associated angles
we can use these two keyframes to form a
loop for our animation one improvement
we can easily add with keyframes is
making the drinking bird pause while
it's drinking we add another keyframe to
our timeline call it see where the
object is held in the down position CNA
are identical the same down position
they're just different locations on the
timeline the bird is held in place while
the time is between CNA here's the graph
of time versus the drinking birds angle
with our initial drinking bird animation
the end of the swing backwards is
particularly unconvincing the bird
abruptly stops and moves forward again
with linear interpolation you get just
that linear motion as you transition
from one pair of keyframes to another
the motion can suddenly change to make
the transition look smoother it's common
to use spline curves of various sorts to
change the motion from keyframe to
keyframe you also see the terms ease in
or ease out which means to starter in
the animation gradually from a stop 3j s
has an add-on library called tween njs
that lets you set up a series of
keyframes with this library here's my
attempt to improve the drinking bird by
using five key frames total I added an
extra two keyframes at the end to get a
wobble you'll get to take a closer look
and critique it in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
