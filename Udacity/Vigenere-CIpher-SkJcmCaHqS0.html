polyalphabetic substitution cipher it is
called the Visioneer cipher visionnaire
cipher has a clever way of representing
possible mappings from one letter to
another as a matrix here we encrypt the
plaintext by processing one letter at a
time across the columns we use the
letters in a key to tell us which row to
look at the mapping now suppose we have
a plaintext and the first three letters
are ATT and we have a key in fact the
key stream should be as long as the
plaintext so this will be lemon lemon
lemon and go on here the first three
letters of the key stream are LEM now
let's see how we can encrypt the
plaintext according to the key we
encrypt the plaintext by processing the
letters one at a time across the columns
the first letter is a so we look at
column a we use the letter in a key L to
look at the role to decide the mapping
of a here at the mapping says L which
means in ciphertext a has been mapped to
L the next plaintext letter is T so we
look at column T and we use the letter
in a key to look at the row to decide
the mapping the letter is e in a key and
so we look at column T and Rho E and the
mapping is X this means that the
ciphertext
of T is X the next plaintext letter is T
again so you look at column T again but
here the letter in the key is M so we
look at column M and mapping of column T
Rho M is F this means that the cipher
text of plaintext T is F therefore for
plaintext ATT and key LEM the
corresponding ciphertext is lxf</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
