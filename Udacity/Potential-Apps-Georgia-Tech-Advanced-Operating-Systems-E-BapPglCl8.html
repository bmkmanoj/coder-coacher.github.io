potential applications that can be built
using this active networks paradigm in
particular what we want to do is
whenever we desire certain ways to
virtualize the behavior of the network
then active networks become very useful
so for instance for implementing
protocol independent multicast reliable
multicast or noticing congestion in the
network and notifying the source and the
destination about the congestion zhh
private IP any casting these are all the
kinds of things that are useful to
implement using active networks and as
you can see from this list the kinds of
things that you want to do using active
networks are things that are related to
network functionality not higher level
application but network functionality in
particular it is useful for building
applications that are difficult to
deploy in the internet so when you rely
on the routing and the internet it is
entirely an administrative setup and the
administrator setup tends to mirror the
physical setup but for your particular
network flow you may want a setup that
is different from the physical setup and
the example I gave you of me sending a
greeting that will be a single message
for most of the traversal through the
internet but at some point it may
actually get demultiplexed and sent to
several different destination those
kinds of multi casting and things like
that a specific to network flow so we
are in some sense overlaying our own
desire on a topology on top of the
physical topology of the Internet but
using the active network paradigm but
the key properties that you want to have
for applications that you want to build
using the active networks paradigm is
that the applications should be
accessible and it should become compact
and it should be fast and it should not
rely on all the nodes being active these
are key things to note in building
applications that live on top of the
active networks so all of these suggest
once again what I said already and that
is it is for providing network layer
functionality not end application
functionality so what you want in the
net
foot layer that is something that he can
orchestrate using the active networks
paradigm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
