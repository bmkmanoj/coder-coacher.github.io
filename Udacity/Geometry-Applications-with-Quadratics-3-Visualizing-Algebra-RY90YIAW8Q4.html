is 9 feet great work if you found those
as always we want to start by writing
the two equations for perimeter and area
we know we're going to surround our
enclose our sunroom with 42 feet of
screening this means that 42 must be the
perimeter the area of the room is 108
square feet so with area we'll put 108
will rearrange this perimeter equation
to get 21 minus W equals L we get that
by dividing each of the terms by two
first and then subtracting w from both
sides now we're ready to substitute we
replace L with its equivalent expression
21 minus W here then we distribute W to
each of the terms to get 108 equals 21 w
minus w squared next we want to set this
equation equal to zero so we'll move
these two terms to the left side so our
W squared term will end up being
positive so adding w squared to both
sides and subtracting 21 w from both
sides will get this equation next we
want to factor this quadratic by finding
factors of 108 that sum to negative 21
those factors are negative 12 and
negative 9 then we set this factor equal
to 0 and this factor equal to 0 so W can
equal 12 or W can equal 9 we know the
width should be the shorter side so
we'll have this twit as 9 feet and this
length as 12 feet and as a quick check
we can add up all the sides to make sure
that the sum is 42 feet that's our
perimeter and finally we check the area
by multiplying the width times the
length or nine times 12 which equals 108
feet squared our original area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
