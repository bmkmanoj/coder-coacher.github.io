want to have it run at the earliest
possible time and the earliest possible
time is in your case after you press the
key on your keyboard making a change in
sublime in order for this to work you'll
need to install es lint first via NPM
run npm install es lint in the terminal
and don't forget the g option to install
it globally great now that you've got es
lint on your system you need two
different sublime plugins sublime linty
is a framework around linting but
doesn't come with specific language
lenders and sublime linter contrib es
lint is the rapper code that connects es
lint to sublime linter when you're done
reset your editor then come back to this
video now look at the main J's file in a
J's folder notice that a linter doesn't
do anything yet you might be forgiven
for believing that something didn't work
during installation but all is fine it's
just that es lint by default doesn't do
anything unless you configure it luckily
it's simple to generate a basic
configuration switch back to your
terminal where you should still be in
the sample directory and run ES lint in
it this will bring up this nifty prompt
that asks you a few questions then
generates an es lint RC file for you if
you now open that file in sublime you'll
notice a few style rules from the
prompts you just answered but the key is
the extends block at the bottom this
tells Islan to run with its recommended
set and anything you add on top will
overwrite or add to it that's super
useful as a starting point
here's Lynn in action see the Foo
variable the red dot next to the line
numbers and how sublime highlighted it
with a red border all around to know
which error occurred just click on foo
and look at the status bar at the bottom
of sublime in this simple example is
obvious that were missing a vow let's
fix it but now foo is still red oh but
the status changed we actually fixed the
previous error and are now looking at a
new one
foo is now defined but never used in
your code so it's fairly slim complains
about it let's add a return statement to
actually use foo in some way here we go
just as I stopped typing the red
vanished and thus all errors went away
if you open your gulp file jazz though
you notice a lot of red around the
require box that's because he has
Lindsay at files run in the browser and
the browser has no required function but
we only want es Lin to turn off nodejs
warnings in this file and luckily you
can do that this special type of comment
works just like a configuration but it's
local to the current file before we move
on to learn how to integrate es Ihnen
into your build keep in mind that the
amazing sublime linter plugin also
supports dozens of other lenders so if
you'd like your CSS HTML or even PHP
Lintott there's a plugin for that check
the notes for links on what else you can
do with sublime linty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
