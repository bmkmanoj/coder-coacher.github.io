so I said that no based on the knowledge
that we're giving here about the mug a
pot an object and the things that we
know from the past we can't actually
prove that this object is a mug we can
prove that the object is stable and
enables drinking based on what we saw
with the proof of the cup the object
we're dealing with here had all the same
criteria as our object in the other
example in addition to these thick sides
and being made of clay so because we had
everything else we were able to easily
prove that it's stable and it enables
drinking but what we can't do is we
can't link protecting his heat to
limiting heat transfer nothing in my
definition of pot actually tells me that
the fact that limits heat transfer
actually protects against heat so while
from my definition of pot I can abstract
that because my new object has six sides
and is made of clay it limits heat
transfer I can't make that last
connection to protecting against heat
that is good David let's make sure that
we understand the processing that David
did he wanted to show that the object is
a mug so he looked at heat conditions
the open conditions were proving that
the object is a mug and there were three
of them for each of them he tried to
build the proof he could do so for the
first two but this was the open one so
he came up with the closest example that
was the part and he did the abstraction
here but he was unable to link these two
because there is no knowledge which
links these two at the present time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
