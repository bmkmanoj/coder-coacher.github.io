got my one image and I yet another image
which is why they're called image one
image 2 all right
and the first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna build what are called
Gaussian pyramids all right and that's
illustrated like this so it's Gaussian
pyramid of image 1 it will talk more
extensively in a minute about how you
might go about building those pyramids
this is just notionally so you
understand what's going on so now I have
these reduced pyramids at that top level
remember I have that very blurry picture
that actually only has a small number of
pixels in it and the motion between them
is actually much smaller and that's
shown here right so here it says R U is
10 that's saying let's suppose the shift
is 10 pixels at the lowest level well
when I cut it in half it becomes 5 then
it becomes 2 and a half then it was
wandering quarter like you keep going so
this is how I reduce the amount of
motion that's present so because I've
reduced the amount of motion I can first
run lucas-kanade II between those
courses level and I might do the
iterative thing that's the thing we
looked at last time where I fit a plane
estimate it shifted a little bit
estimate it shifted a little bit keep
doing till it till I converge so that
will map the motion between the very
reduced image 1 and the very reduced
image 2 right so I can I can compare
that I can find the motion between them
the question then is what do I do next
well what I have to do is I have to go
from the coarser to the next finer level
ok and what's written here is warp and
up sample all right we're gonna go
through the details of that but
basically the way you can think about
this is I compare something at a course
level then I know okay if I were to
double up this image and double up that
image I'd have to double up the motion
field I'd also have to double the the
amount I'm moving we'll do that
algorithm a minute but I could apply
that to the next level and what that
will do is that will get me the next
level very close to the second image at
that level and I could run Lukasik
annatee again and then I can iterate and
run that over again and eventually get
the entire motion field</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
