by now but let's do one more example for
good measure this time the challenge is
to write a method inside the class movie
archive in this method should take in a
year in a dictionary of movies and
return an array of strings listing the
movies that were released that year to
start us off I've written the shell of
our movie archive class and this
dictionary of AI themed movies here in
between the parenthesis defining the
movie archive class will write our
function let's call it filter by year
filter by year is going to take in a
year as a parameter which will be of
type int and it'll also take in a
dictionary of movies which will be of
type dictionary and that dictionary will
hold keys of type string the movie
titles and values of type int the
release here it will return an array of
movie titles so here we'll type our
arrow and then the return type is an
array of strings since we're going to
return an array of strings will need to
initialize an array of strings to put
our filtered movie titles into and we'll
go ahead and return that array so we can
quiet this compiler error the next step
is to loop through the dictionary that's
passed in and check each key value pair
to see if the release here matches the
year passed in as a parameter to live
through the dictionary we can use a for
in loop will call the value release here
then if the year parameter is equal to
the value of release here we add that
movie title to our filtered array now
our filter by your method should be good
to go to call it will need an instance
of the movie archive class so here I'll
initialize a movie archive and call it
my archive then I can call filter by
year using dot syntax and of course the
dictionary we want to filter is AI
themed movies and let's see what AI
themed movies came out in 1982 and over
here in the sidebar we can see Blade
Runner and if we try 2013 we get her
that ought to give you a good start on
functions be sure to complete the
exercises for more practice defining and
calling functions as always you can find
a link to them in the instructors notes
next up we'll talk about classes
and their properties and methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
