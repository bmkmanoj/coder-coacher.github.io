talk a little bit about what used to
work well still does what worked a while
ago and what's working now so what
worked sort of say yesterday okay
yesterday being probably not today
alright so things like reading license
plates well that's pretty easy because
it's a fixed font zip codes numbers on
checks those were getting much better
and handwritten recognition of digits
has gotten pretty good fingerprint
recognition the analysis of those
patterns because the patterns share
certain types of characteristics and we
could find those characteristics face
detection but you'll notice that here
the thing knows who I am but it hasn't
yet figured out who megan is right today
we do recognition by the way you know
these days typically when you pop up or
put an image to say into Facebook or
some other thing it'll suggest to you
the names of the people that are there
and that means that it's found the faces
and it's also recognized who they are
now it doesn't search its database of
everybody it only searches your friends
right so it doesn't have to try to
recognize this as anybody on the planet
just the five friends that I happen to
have right so then you might ask well
how does it know the picture of those
friends well other people have tagged
Megan and images every time you tagged
an image with a face person's name
you're actually telling Google or
whoever to or Facebook or ever you're
doing how to recognize that person so
without meaning making it sound
nefarious it is the case that every time
you tag somebody else in a picture
you're making it that much easier for
computers to find that person in other
images you are teaching you are not
tagging you are teaching the system what
Megan looks like so just just just think
about that every time that you identify
people in an image we've actually talked
about sift features and using the
location of sift features to recognize
objects and you know sort of flat
texture things like the book covers all
right now what just happened this is
google net 2014 which was part of a
competition and you can see here
sure that given this image okay it
labels the monitor the bookshelf it even
labels this this is domestic cat and it
looks to me like this cat is jumping in
the air so that's pretty cool what makes
this picture hard of course is the very
intense color variation so it was able
to find just basically through the color
and texture because that's the only
thing that's there the fact that there
were oranges and been as there so this
is a pretty intriguing result and then
here's a result that calls into question
the importance of context and maybe what
it means is that context doesn't matter
when things are very clear all right so
I love this picture I'm not sure you can
read this but it says hat with wide brim
on the top and it says dog on the bottom
now I don't know how many pictures there
are of dogs with hats and wide brims
wearing them what scares me is there
might be tens of thousands because
people have way too much time on their
hands or something I don't know but it
is an impressive result that it was able
to recognize the hat on top of the dog
which you have to believe is not a
likely position for a hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
