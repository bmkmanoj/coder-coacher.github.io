very important ideas about motivation
and emotion so with motivation we've
seen how need States lead to drives and
then those drives lead to motivated
behaviors we've also discussed how needs
can be arranged in a hierarchy from the
most basic like physiological and safety
needs all the way up to higher level
needs of self esteem and self
actualization we've also talked about
incentives and how incentives are
important rewards for doing things well
we've talked about two basic needs sex
and hunger and sex is about survival of
the species hunger is about survival of
the individual and with sex we've seen
for instance the brain system that
regulates it is the hypothalamus and the
hormones involved in regulating sexual
behavior are mostly testosterone
likewise with hunger we've seen how the
brain again the hypothalamus regulates
hunger as well as the blood glucose
levels and then finally again hormones
but this time leptin greylen and insulin
for example and then we've also seen how
culture very much shapes what we eat and
we call that cuisine so we've also
talked about emotion and emotions or
experience when we think of something as
both meaningful and harmful or
beneficial to our well-being in other
words how we appraise events shape the
emotions we experience so for instance
if we think something has been lost we
might experience the emotion of sadness
if we think something is a threat to us
we might experience the emotion of
either fear or anger emotions are
accompanied by changes in our physiology
in our expression and in our feeling
states now emotions and moods are not
the same emotions are result from
specific events and they tend to be very
short in duration moods on the other
hand are often come about from something
very vague and they're much more longer
lasting and then effective traits are
personality dispositions so some people
are more likely to experience anger and
sadness our anxiety
for instance and then lastly we've
talked about how the stereotypes of men
and women being different in emotion are
not really all that true a lot of the
time men and women in fact experience in
express emotion very much the same way
we did see however that women are better
at talking about emotion precisely and
also reading emotion on people's faces
and in their voices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
