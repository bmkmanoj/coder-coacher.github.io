acyclic graph of all the tasks that I
need to do to become a gentleman spy
okay let's see being smooth depends on
an intimate knowledge of whiskey's which
depends on spending a year in a mountain
monastery devoting your life to
meditation and whiskey sampling yep
see I even configured each task with a
group one for marksmanship one for
counterintelligence one for looking good
in a suit sure but do you actually know
how to do all these tasks like for
example what would be the action in the
list of the shockingly good at fencing
tasks oh good point well other people
become gentleman spies in the past I
mean I'll just look up a documentary on
James Bond or sterling Archer and I'll
figure it out you realize these were
fictional characters right that's just
your opinion man rumor has it they were
actually based on never mind but you do
have a good point we've learned a lot
about the nuts and bolts of how to
declare it configure and run Gradle
tasks but we still don't know how to
define the tasks you need to build say a
Java project hey super spies what would
be the console commands you'd use to
compile and build a Java project oh I
feel like Java see something and then
you need to add some subjects bozos Oh
writing our own task to build a Java
project would be a huge pain especially
if we wanted to make sure it was all
portable thankfully my colleagues at
cradle as well as hundreds of community
contributors have developed a huge
number of plugins than to find useful
tasks for you we don't have to write a
single task to build a Java project we
just need to import the task from a Java
plug-in too bad we can't import any spy
skills that's alright I really wanted to
be a build engineer anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
