looking at some tricky behavior of O
notation when we're dealing with numbers
to illustrate this let's take a look at
number of 4000 now 4000 has a magnitude
of size of well 4000 but you can write
it down with a lot less than 4,000
digits in fact you can write it down
with one two three four digits so it's
actually a logarithmic number of digits
in relation to the size of the number
similarly if we wonder write down 40,000
which is 10 times as big as 4,000 we
only need to write down well five digits
so the number of digits is growing
logarithmically with the size of the
number that we want to represent now
let's say we call the actual number we
want to represent n and let's say the
number of digits necessary to represent
n will call d and now let's take a look
at a fairly simple algorithm to test
whether n is prime so we have this basic
is prime function the tests whether n is
prime and does this by first checking
event is less than 2 since 0 and 1 or
not prime and returning false in that
case if N equals 2 then we return true
because 2 is prime then we get rid of
all the even numbers because none of the
even numbers other than to our prime and
then we check if there are any odd
numbers between 3 and the square root of
n that divide n because if there are any
numbers that divide n then it's not
prime and it turns out to check for
prime ality you actually only need to
check up to the square root of n and
we're not going to get into why that is
the case right now because well that's
another course but if it finds any
numbers that divide n then we return
false and otherwise we fall all the way
through this and return true so my first
question is which of these answers best
characterized the asymptotic running
time of this prime ality algorithm as a
function of n the value of the input
size
is it constant order logarithmic is it
on the order of the square root of n is
it linear quadratic or does it turn out
that this is exponential and my second
question is what about if we express the
running time as a function of D the
number of digits that it takes to
represent the number rather than as a
function of n the actual value of the
number if we express the running time in
this way then is it linear in the number
of digits quadratic sit grow to the
tenth power just grow to 10 to the log
of d 10 to the D over 2 10 to the square
root of D or 10 to the D check whichever
one is best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
