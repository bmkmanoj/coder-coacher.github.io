professor at the Stanford Medical School
Medical Center clinically I work as a
high-risk obstetrician which means we
see high-risk pregnancies and I also do
fetal ultrasounds on pregnancies in
general looking for fetal anomalies so
every patient that we see we do require
that we know their blood type and Rh
type and I know you've talked a lot
about the ABO blood system it's
important because at delivery there's a
chance that they may bleed whether they
have a vaginal delivery or whether they
have a c-section sometimes a bleed most
of time they bleed very minimally and so
they don't require transfusion but
occasionally in rare cases they have a
lot of bleeding and it becomes a very
complicated case where they require lots
of blood if you need blood then it's
important to have the type of blood that
the person receives match to their type
so we we want to know what that is and
in fact we actually require that they be
typed twice so they're typed at a
prenatal visit and they also type when
they come in before they receive blood
so there's to that reported that is
important because you can't just it
could be a mistake I mean that one if
they have just one result so the policy
is that there's two that actually
correlate that they're the same if you
don't have a blood type then and you
need blood then the only option is you
know the blood bank gives you universal
donor which would be 0 negative but Oneg
ative is not the most common type of
blood there is and you know you can't
use up your entire pool of o-negative
blood so the best thing would be to you
know give the person that the type of
blood that they actually have so in
pregnancy particularly the Rh factor
which is a rhesus blood group on the red
cell is important this refers to a group
of antigens the most common being the D
antigen and there's a D+ group and
there's a d- antigen in other words
they're missing the D antigen so
everybody has two alleles right so there
they could be d+ de positive or d+ d-
ordi- DNA
so it's kind of like the 0 type where 0
is nothing where's a of a B or nothing
correct exactly exactly so just like
with a blood type you can have
homozygous a witch be a positive a
positive or heterozygous a which would
be a plus Oh a plus oh right or a 0 and
so this becomes an issue when we find an
Rh negative woman whose neck d- d- so if
she marries a partner who is not arch-
in other words he's rh positive and he's
either d plus d plus or D plus D
negative both of them are which are
considered you know d or rh positive
then there's a chance that her child
could be Rh positive either d plus well
actually would have to be a hundred
percent D plus D negative right because
one of the genes comes from her and
it'll be d- and the other one is going
to come from her partner so we need to
know what her partner's genotype is for
the RH antigen and we need to know if
the fetus has you know a hundred percent
chance of being rh positive and so just
to be clear here then the risk here is
that the mother would be Rh negative the
babies are each positive correct and
it's the mothers and the baby's blood
were to see each other that the mother's
blood might not recognize the Rh
positive and the baby's blood and an
attack it or something no basically if
the mothers arch- and sees the Rh
positive in the fetus in the fetus blood
fetal blood then it will recognize it as
being foreign because she's never seen
the D antigen until she became pregnant
so what are besides the actual mother
mother fetus interaction are there any
other important clinical settings
related to this or otherwise we're
knowing blood types really important
just the first one you're the mother
mostly for her her safety and fishy
hemorrhage during pregnancy or delivery
this you need blood and and there are
times when
I guess patients need a lot of blood or
a little bit of blood I mean is there
ever has ever been a scenario or you're
like oh gosh I need this type of blood
but you know I don't have enough for yes
what do you do so yeah we have something
called a massive transfusion protocol
this happens when there's a obstetric
ahem Bridge disaster that happens
usually if you have time you try to give
matched blood and you know the person's
blood type especially if you anticipate
the possibility and she's already been
crossed and matched but if not then you
know you you activate the protocol and
you give o-negative blood and and we've
had cases where due to certain
conditions of the placenta and the
uterus especially one called the
placenta accreta where the placenta
grows into the uterus where you can't
remove the placenta after delivery we
have to remove the entire uterus and
there's so much blood flow that they the
mothers lose so much blood they can
receive you know 50 to 100 units of
blood so for all the sort of general Rh
negative women they received something
called rhogam during pregnancy rhogam is
an immunoglobulin that blocks the
antigens on the red cells so if you
might imagine the fetal cell trying to
get into the maternal circulation if it
got in there the rhogam would just
attach itself to all the sites bind all
the sites so the mother can't see the
antigens and you can she won't amount
that you won't mount a response so that
way if the fetus happened to be Rh
positive charge positive that's correct
then she won't see the positive D
antigen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
