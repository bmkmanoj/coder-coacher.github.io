need atomic instructions that are going
to both read and write memory there are
three main types of such instructions
the first type is an atomic exchange
instruction something like this the
parameters for this instruction looked
like the parameters for a load or a
store but what an exchange does it does
both allowed in the store at the same
time so that it swaps the content of r1
with the contents of the memory location
that it addresses so a load would read
this and put it in r1 a store would take
what's in r1 and put it here an exchange
swaps the contents of the two so the
register gets what was in the memory
location and the memory location gets
what was in the register if we have an
atomic exchange what we can do is put
one into r1 and then repeatedly as long
as r1 is equal to one exchange r1 with
our lock variable so this is the idea r1
being 1 we are exchanging our r1 with
the lock variable we start out with 1 in
our one when we swap them if the memory
location for the lock had a zero it
becomes one in the same instruction that
gets us a zero if we do get a zero we
exit this loop and the lock variable has
become one if however the lock was
already occupied then we swap one with
one our one stays one so we keep looping
so until we succeed in obtaining a 0 we
will loop here just as before but also
as we are getting our 0 we are
atomically setting the lock variable to
1 so nobody else can also observe a zero
pretty much if we get a zero in our r1
that means that everybody else would try
to do this at about the same time we'll
get our 1 if somebody else did this
before us then we would be getting their
1 in our r1 so the fact that we are
reading 0 here means that we are the
ones who acquired the lock so atomic
exchange gives us this read and write at
the same time behavior that we
to implement their locks and as you can
see the lock function can be now very
simple the drawback of the Atomics
exchange operation is that it keeps
writing to the memory location all the
time even while the lock is busy while
the lock has been locked by somebody
else
so as long as we are doing this we will
be doing these rights even though we are
just getting a one all the time so the
second main type of atomic instructions
is a whole family of things that can be
classified as tests and then right so
the idea is that we test the location
and if it satisfies some conditions then
we're gonna write but we don't write all
the time so let's say we have some sort
of a test and store instruction which
behaves like this we read the memory
location that we are addressing and if
that location is zero then we store r1
into it and in that case R 1 becomes 1
but if the location wasn't zero then we
don't store anything to that location we
just return a zero so the idea here is
that we are testing whether the lock is
free if it is free then we try to write
a1 in it if it's not free then we simply
continue there is no point in trying to
write a lock that we know is not free so
we are avoiding the writes that happen
in the exchange while the lock is
actually not free so this behaves very
similarly to the exchange except that it
only does the right if the lock has the
unlocked state</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
