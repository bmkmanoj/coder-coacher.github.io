dependencies and control dependencies
starting from a given statement the set
of statements which you get that is the
set of statements that cuff possibly
could have influenced the statement in
question is also called a program slice
and so called backward slice starting
from a statement contains all of the
statement that the statement s in
question would transitively depend upon
you obtain a backward slice by starting
with the statement s and then following
all the dependencies until you've
reached a fixed point the interesting
thing about slices is that anything
that's not in the slice cannot have
influenced the state at the statement S
or whether s is being executed or not
therefore a slice can act as a filter
that may look straight this by an
example as an example let's take a look
at the statement tag is true this is off
statement s now let's see what's all
contained in the slice of tag first of
all there's no direct data dependency
because no variable is being read in
here however this is control dependent
on this if condition this if condition
again is dependent on the character C so
this is also part of the backward slice
and this condition up here reads from
the variable S which is passed as a
parameter up here so this is also part
of the backward slice now let's go to
quote where does code come from it is
being initialized up here and set down
here so we end up in the place where
quote is being set now can you keep on
doing this
completing the backward slice of s one
by one check all statements that are
part of the backdoor slice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
