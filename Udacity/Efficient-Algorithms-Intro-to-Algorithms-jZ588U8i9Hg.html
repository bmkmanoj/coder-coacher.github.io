number of different algorithms that we
were trying to solve and for each of
them we worked out what their running
time was so for finding the connectivity
between two nodes in an undirected
unweighted graph the running time is the
number of nodes plus the number of edges
finding the shortest path in a weighted
undirected connected graph took time m
times the logarithm of n removing the
minimum value of a heap
that's like log n for the problem of
finding the shortest path between all
pairs of nodes in a graph and a weighted
graph was taking n cubed time at least
one of the algorithms and so okay so you
have a sense that these are these are
considered to be pretty good algorithms
in fact in some cases very good
algorithms and you see that they're all
polynomial e bounded so there's some
polynomial in nm that actually is larger
asymptotically than all of these and by
and large the algorithms for which that
we can actually solve in a reasonable
amount of time all seem to be in this
category of having a polynomial bound
and that has led theoreticians to use at
least to define efficient in one
particular way sometimes and that is
that an algorithm is efficient if it has
a polynomial bound on its running time
and a problem can be efficiently solved
obviously if it has an efficient
algorithm now it's a reasonable question
to ask will do all problems have
efficient algorithms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
