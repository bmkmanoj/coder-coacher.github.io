concentrates on sort sorting is a
fundamental operation and understanding
how we might approach this problem in
the parallel world gives a lot of
insight as to what works well and what
doesn't work well on GPUs there's a lot
of neat algorithms in sorting and I hope
the rest of the unit gives you some new
ideas about how to approach the design
of efficient parallel algorithms now
sort is a challenging problem on GPUs
for several reasons the first is that
most sort algorithms are serial
algorithms or at least usually expressed
in a serial fashion particularly those
you might have learned in an algorithms
class so all those nice algorithms that
you learned in school are not
necessarily applicable here and we'll
see this in a bit
the second is that for performance
reasons we prefer to look at algorithms
parallel algorithms that coalesce memory
accesses that have little branch
divergence among threads and
particularly that are able to keep the
hardware busy by keeping lots of threads
busy at the same time so the sort of
algorithms that you might have learned
in an algorithm of course tend to be
moving around little bits of memory at a
time and they have very branchy code and
they're not often very parallel so we'd
like to take a look at algorithms that
have the other characteristics that can
keep the hardware busy that do limit
branch divergence the do prefer
coalesced memory accesses and so what
we're going to do is look at some
classic sorting algorithms and discuss
how they might map onto a parallel world
we'll start with one of the simplest
algorithms and one that maps nicely to a
parallel implementation odd-even sort
also known as brick sort if you're
familiar with the serial algorithm
called bubble sort this is the parallel
version of bubble sort so we're going to
start by putting all of our elements to
sort in a row and then we're going to
mark all the even elements as black and
all the odd elements as red new a not
even sort in the first phase each red
element looks down the line to the left
toward the left end and pairs up with
the black elements it's facing now of
that pair is out of order they swap
places
when colors as well otherwise they stay
in the same places now every red element
turns around faces to its right and
pairs up with the black element in the
other direction again they swap if
they're out of order so we continue
until the sequence is sorted so let's
try an example so just to show this with
some real numbers we'll try a sample
with
five numbers we start by pairing them up
starting at the left and we swap each
pair if they're out of order then we
pair them with the opposite polarity and
continue the process we return to
pairing them the way that we did in the
first step and continue to pair them one
way than the other way then one wave in
the other way and so we finally conclude
with a sorted sequence so it's very
important that we understand how to
measure the step and we're complexity of
these algorithms because that's often
the dominant factor in their run time so
for this algorithm what is the step
complexity of this algorithm order of
one log in and n log N or N squared the
number of steps and what is the total
amount of work that we need to do with
the same choices please check your
choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
