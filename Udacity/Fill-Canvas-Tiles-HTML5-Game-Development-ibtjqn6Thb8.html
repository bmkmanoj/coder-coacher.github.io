actually fetch the graphics context from
the tile that's been passed in now this
is going to be the graphics of context
that we're actually going to draw our
bitmaps to the first thing we do here is
actually call a fill wrecked just clear
the background of this tile in case we
reuse this thing in the future for any
reason the next thing we're going to do
is actually create a rectangle that has
top bottom left and right parameters
that represent the tile itself will use
this here in a second to pass to the is
visible function the next thing we do is
actually create a V wrecked object with
a top left bottom and right value that
represents the boundaries of the tile
and worldspace we then walk through each
tile for our map and much like before
determine whether or not it's visible
only this time we determine whether or
not it's visible to the past in canvas
rather than the entire view wrecked to
do this we utilize the same intersect
wreck function passing in the V wreck
that we created before in creating a new
rectangle that represents the tile that
we're looking at if the tile is not
visible we then of course continue on if
it is visible we continue with our same
process modify world X and world why
offsetting it by our new view rectangle
values and then we call our draw image
function now notice that the draw image
actually hasn't changed in fact most of
this code is actually identical to your
original draw function except that we're
now testing tiles against V wrecked
given from our canvas tile as well as
drawing to the V wrecked context</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
