we're gonna specify sort of all the
elements in HN and you've already sort
of seen them n is gonna be the number of
states so s1 through SN is our set of
states so that's like sunny rainy snowy
and then there is a notion of a state
sequence written as Q and the idea is
that Q sub I is whatever state I'm at at
time I okay so when I say Q sub 3 equals
s2 what that means is a time step 3
I'm in the second state all right given
the state I can talk about the full
specification of an hmm and for whatever
reason hmm referred to as lambda its a
triplet made up of three components that
you've already seen there's a state
transition matrix those are the A's the
probability of going from one state at
one time given that you were at another
state
there's the observation matrix which
before I was showing you as a discrete
and it was actually represented as a
matrix there's also a continuous version
where your output is you have a
distribution over some feature vector
for each state so maybe it's you know
you're outputting a some sort of
measurement and which says I've got one
Gaussian in state one and different
Gaussian state ooh and a given bit
different Gaussian State three the idea
is that for any given output you can
talk about the likelihood of the
probability of given that output given
that you were in a particular state and
then the last thing you need is that
initial distribution PI right that says
what's the probability of starting at
each in a particular State</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
