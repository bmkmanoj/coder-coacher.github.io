what is that well let's dig in and find
out q can be written as a function so we
might have parentheses around SN a or
you can think of it as a table so in
this class we're going to view Q as a
table and it's got two dimensions s and
a so s is the state that we're looking
at and a is the action we might take q
represents the value of taking action a
and state s and there's two components
to that the two components are the
immediate reward that you get for taking
action a and state s plus the discounted
reward and what that is about what the
discounted reward is about is the reward
you get for future actions so an
important thing to know is that Q is not
greedy in the sense that it just
represents the reward you get for acting
now it also represents the reward you
get for acting in the future let's
suppose we have Q already created for us
we have this table how can we use it to
figure out what to do
so what we do in any particular state is
the policy and we represent the policy
with PI so PI of s means what is the
action we take when we're in state s or
what is the policy for state s and we
take advantage of our Q table to figure
that out here's how it works
we're in state s and we want to find out
which action is the best well all we
need to do is look across all the
potential actions and find out which
value of Q s of a is maximized so we
don't change s we just step through each
value of a and the one that is the
largest is the action we should take and
the mathematical way to represent this
is to use the function Arg max so Arg
max
of a of this function so what that does
is it finds the a that maximizes this
and then the answer is a after we run Q
learning for long enough we will
eventually converge to the optimal
policy and we represent that with a
little star so the optimal policy is PI
star of s and similarly the optimal Q
table is Q star si now this is how to
use a Q table if you have it we need now
to consider how do we build that Q table
in the first place</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
