memory management and CPU management are
core services that any operating system
has to provide and we discussed how spin
had its own way of dealing with those
core services we will do the same
analysis for exokernel as to how it does
memory management and CPU scheduling
first memory management specifically
let's see how exokernel will handle a
page fault incurred by a library
operating system so in this picture that
I'm showing you here is an application
thread running and maybe this
application thread belongs to a specific
library operating system and so long as
this application thread is doing normal
memory accesses where all its virtual
addresses have been mapped to physical
page frames the thread is executing at
hardware speeds on the CPU life is good
but life may not be always good because
this thread may incur a page fault and
when it incurs a page fault the page
fault is first fielded by exokernel
exokernel knows which library operating
system is currently executing on the CPU
it has no knowledge of processes within
a library operating system all it knows
is that this library operating system is
doing something on the CPU and it knows
that there is a page fault incurred and
it can kick it up to the library
operating system through a registered
Handler and we will talk about how these
handlers are known to occur no later on
right now I just want to give you the
roadmap of how a page fault is handled
in exokernel because the library
operating system knows about processes
whereas exokernel has no knowledge about
that and it services the page fault and
servicing the page fault may involve
requesting exokernel for a page frame to
host the specific page that is missing
and if it does that as we detailed
before that will involve the library
asking exokernel for a page frame
and exokernel creating a binding for a
page frame and returning an encrypted
key for the page frame assume for the
moment that the library operating system
has page frames already with it and all
that it was doing at this point is in
servicing the page fault it establishes
a mapping between the virtual page that
was missing and the page frame that
contains the contents of that virtual
page once it does that that mapping
between the virtual page and the frame
that it corresponds to has to be
presented to the exokernel so the
library presents that mapping to
exokernel along with the TLB entry where
it wants us mapping to be placed in the
hardware TLB remember that when the
process runs the CPU is consulting the
hardware TLB to see if there is a valid
mapping between the virtual page number
and a physical frame so that the CPU can
go and access a page and we got the page
fault because it's a mapping did not
exist and the whole point of this
exercise is for the library operating
system to reestablish a mapping but it
cannot do that directly into the TLB so
it presents a mapping to exokernel along
with the encrypted key that represents
the capability that the library
operating system has to a specific TLB
entry where it wants this to be placed
exokernel will validate the encrypted
key presented by the library operating
system and assuming all is good it will
go ahead and install the mapping in the
hardware TLB and this is a privileged
operation meaning that it can be done
only in the kernel mode of the processor
that's the reason that you have this red
line between the library operating
system that runs at the non privileged
level and exokernel that runs at the
privileged level to do certain
operations such as installing an entry
into the TLB and once the entry has been
installed in the TLB if the library
operating system is once
again scheduled on the processor and is
the same process as run by the library
operating system when it generates the
same virtual address we're gonna find a
valid mapping and life will be good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
