right well the first thing that happens
is we re sample but by the way we're
going to go through the exact algorithm
of this in a little bit to resample what
we do is we first randomly pick a
particle from this top distribution this
is the distribution we had after the
multiplication right and of course the
bigger the wait the more likely we will
pull out a particle that's what these
weights mean so we're more likely to
find things here than say over here for
two reasons one there's just more
particles over here than over here or to
the right and on the left and also those
particles have a higher weight they have
a bigger value so I sample the particles
and every new particle attic rate starts
off with a uniform weight so I just let
say I need a thousand particles a
thousand times I might get the same
particle more than once that's okay then
what I do is I I sample and I move now
what do you mean move well remember
those actions the use okay so if I if
the robot thinks it took a step 2 meters
to the right okay it shifts that
particle by 2 meters it shifts its
belief aware it is 2 meters and then
finally it adds a little bit of noise
this is just like we were doing the
count remember you start off with the
distribution you do the deterministic
shift and then you add some noise well
our to do our distribution we first have
to sample our particles then do the
deterministic shift then we add a little
bit of uncertainty to that okay so here
you can see the resulting thing is we
have a density that has been Reese ample
so there's like a whole bunch of points
and shifted with a little uncertainty
