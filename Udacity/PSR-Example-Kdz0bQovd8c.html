use to kind of motivate this idea so
here's here's a representation of a palm
DP it's got how many states for good
it's got how many observations um three
right blue green and red so these two
states are indistinguishable by their
immediate observations and let's say
there's four actions north south east
west so north from this thread takes you
to this green North finestra it takes
you to this blue east and west from this
blue leave you where you were etc that
make some sense um yes so we've got left
left right up down as our actions and
these four states and these three
possible observations and so we can
represent this as a palm DP if we know
if we know these dynamics we know this
system we know this model we can
represent you know what's the
probability we're in each of these
states one two three four the states and
so for example if I say okay I'm going
to start off uniformly at random oh and
by the way the state you're in is
currently red mm-hmm so then our belief
state would be what 00 a half a half if
we then go left then our belief state
would be 00 I half a half still right if
we went up and observed green then our
probability distribution would be 0 1 0
0 we'd definitely be in this state and
actually given that there's no
stochasticity in this case we would know
where we were forever after we can
continue to act and we'll know where we
are we're going to try to riras nth the
same idea the same system the same model
but not using a palm DP but instead by
using a set of predictions so I'm going
to claim that the tests that we're going
to use for this representation well
there's lots of possibilities but we're
going to do is say hey what would happen
if you were to go up would you see blue
so what's the probability that you'd see
blue after going up and if you're to go
left would you see red what's the
probability of seeing red if we were to
go left from the current state and so
again the state is going to be a set is
going to be predictions is going to be
probabilities on these two quantities
and we're going to try to keep that
updated we're going to keep these these
predictions updated as we move around in
the environment ok so we're replacing a
distribution over States with a kind of
distribution over the outcomes of tests
that we might take yeah I think that's a
good way to think about it it's this
this probabilities that we get here
don't necessarily have to add up to
on right it's sort of independent the
question of how likely is it to see blue
when we go up how likely is to see red
after we go left but but other than that
it does it is a sort of probabilistic
quantity but we kind of like this notion
that it's that these tests are actions
and observations because at any given
time we could say hey this seems like
the kind of situation where it's you
know two-thirds probable that I go up in
and see blue let's just try that just to
make sure so we can go up see whether or
not we see blue and see how often that
actually seems to happen it's still not
trivial to learn in this case but it at
least it's grounded out in observables
actions and observations right and I
guess sort of philosophically if I might
wax philosophical for a moment there's
really no difference between this and
states right because the states are kind
of made up things which represent states
of the world dare I say it then these
tests also kind of represent at least
implicitly other states of the world and
they're just as fine or there's
reasonable representation as these
made-up nominal circles yeah they're not
certainly no worse but I'm going to
argue that in principle they might even
be better because again you can actually
execute these tests and see what the
outcomes were and then that'll tell you
where you were and possibly where you
are yeah or at least would let you
validate your current predictions
whereas with States if I think okay I'm
in the belief state zero a half a half 0
there's nothing that you can validate
there's no test that you can run there's
no experiment you can do in the world
that would tell you what the states
actually were because the states are
good not observable but these tests can
tell you sort of whether you are I'm
going to try to ground this out an
example so you know do I am I sick do I
have a particular disease well there are
tests that I could run that would tell
me and then I might be able to do other
more interesting things and that's kind
of a practical thing to know rather than
asking the question I mean it's one way
of sort of answering an underlying
question of mi in the state of being
sick or in the state of I don't know
having blue hay fever I guess that's
this upper left state yes so I have a so
I'm intrigued so so what's next what do
we do with these tests well so in
principle we should be able to learn PS
are representations and because again if
we have a test we should be able to
validate it and make our
dictions better over time and in
principle we could plan in this kind of
space as well we're not going to talk
about either of those in the class but I
do want to do a slightly more concrete
example of these tests probabilities
with this little grid that we've got
going here just to just to make it more
concrete okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
