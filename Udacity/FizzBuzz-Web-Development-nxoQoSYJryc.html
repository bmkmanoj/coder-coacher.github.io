template that when provided with the
variable n prints fizzbuzz up to n now
what is fizzbuzz this buzz is is a
little programming test that's easy it's
a quick way to see if somebody actually
knows how to program simple things or
not basically when you do fist buzz I
want you to follow this logic if n is
divisible by 3 I want you to print Fitz
if n is divisible by 5 I want you to
print buzz and if n is divisible by 3
and 5 I want you to print fizzbuzz and
if it's not divisible by 3 or 5 just
print the number let me show you what
this will look like when it's working
okay so here is a working fizzbuzz app
I'm just gonna ask you to paste in the
template for our fizzbuzz but here's
here's what it looks like so if we were
to say fizzbuzz of N equals 100 this is
what it would print 1 2 3 is divisible
by 3 so we print fizz 5 is divisible by
5 so we print buzz 4 is neither 6 is 3
so we print fizz come down you hear 215
we print fizz buzz so as you can see
anything too visible I three or five
prints fizz or buzz
both phase and buzz and if it's neither
it just prints the number and the source
that we generated looks like this I use
an ordered list and then I'm just
printing list elements for each value as
we count up to n is 100 and you can see
N equals 100 down here the handler that
I'm using looks something like this
I just a pad added this to the end of
the file we've been working in I made a
new URL called fizzbuzz which uses
fizzbuzz handler which is defined here
which inherits from handler and it gets
n from the request defaulting to 0
converts it to an integer and and in n
is the same as basically saying if n N
equals int N and then we're rendering
fizzbuzz HTML passing in and equals n
what I want to do for this quiz is
generate fizzbuzz dot HTML and once
you've got that working
I'd like you to paste it here okay good
luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
