choice is reusing a local implementation
so let's say that the developer has
access to a local implementation of a
class called account and she then takes
that class account and derives and
extends it to to create public methods
in the API bank account and creates a
bank account implementation so she
started with a local implementation of a
class account and extended it to
implement the bank account now this bank
account service that has been created
she has to make that visible outside in
the network so that any client can
access it so this is where she uses the
built-in class available in the
distributed object model of Java called
the remote interface and what she does
is using that built in remote class
that's available in the distributed
object model of Java she makes the
methods in the bank account class that
she created visible on the network as a
result of this so now she has created
this interface derived from the remote
interface she has created this interface
for her bank account object and so this
interface becomes now publicly available
for anyone to access so clients on the
network can have access to this
interface bank account now she
instantiates this bank account
implementation what happens when the
bank account implementation is actually
instantiated the location of the bank
account implementation object the
instantiation that she has done is not
visible to the client all that is
visible to the client is the interface
the actual location of the object is not
something that is visible to the client
and therefore the implementer has to do
the heavy lifting of finding a way to
make the location of the service visible
to the clients on the network so in the
first choice all that we used was the
built-in class in the distributed object
model of Java which is a remote
face to publish the interface for a
facility that we created in this case
the bank account and the methods in it
and once we publish it that interface is
available because we derived it from the
remote interface the interface bank
account interface is available for any
client on the network however when we
instantiate the object the location of
the object where that service is
available is not something that is
readily visible to the client and so the
heavy lifting has to be done by the
implementer to make that object that
have been instantiated visible on the
network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
