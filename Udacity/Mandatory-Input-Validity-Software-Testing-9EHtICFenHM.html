looked at there was a vast space of
inputs and some small part of that
constituted the actual input domain for
the software under test and what
happened was when we generated in
invalid inputs which is extremely easy
to do they were executing a boring part
of the software under test and getting
mapped to input rejection errors and
those rejections of invalid input or
basically forcing us to generate another
value and submit it and see what happens
it's gonna happen is the random testing
loop is going to spend a lot of time
spinning that is to say stressing only a
small part of the software under test
but there's actually something different
that can happen that's much worse than
that so the other thing that can happen
is the input isn't rejected and the
reason that an invalid input might not
be rejected is that the software under
test fails to contain sufficient
validity checking logic in order to
distinguish valid inputs from invalid
inputs and so what we get now is
something potentially much worse we get
strangeness behavior crashes or
something else very bad and the problem
is that when we get misbehavior crashes
and other bad behavior from the software
under test these behaviors instead of
being rejected by the software under
test and letting our random testing loop
proceed these behaviors look like bugs
so normally if we crash the software
under test this is something that we
have to track down manually and now
we're taking a developer's time and once
we start taking humans time or
essentially doing is mounting a denial
of service attack on whoever's
processing bugs that come out of the
random testing loop after looking at
about 10 bugs that are caused by invalid
inputs to the software under test the
person is looking at that inputs is
going to get tired of it and isn't going
to look at them anymore and now we have
a problem now we have a random testing
loop producing no actionable output and
so our random testing out effort is
basically failing and so let's talk a
little bit about why I software under
test would lack of validity checker well
as we saw I believe in unit 1 internal
interfaces that is to say interfaces
within a product and interfaces we're
and interfaces that dont span trust
boundaries often lack full validity
checking and they do that for
performance reasons for code
maintainability reasons basically
because we basically because we have to
trust somebody sometime otherwise we
can't get any software written other
reason is there exists software for
which is impossible to construct
validity checker and so earlier in this
unit I was talking about the example of
using C Smith that is to say my random
test generator that generates C programs
for testing compilers and it turns out
that C compilers contain it turns out
the sea compilers don't contain a good
liddie checker for C and the reasons for
that are kind of involved but the quick
answer is is that if you have a sea
program it's undecidable whether that
program the reference is a null pointer
access and out of bounds array element
or do something else that violates the
rules of C so compilers do do quite a
lot of validity checking that is to say
they look for syntactically invalid see
what they fail to do is check for the
dynamic validity properties that are
required for certain kinds of Miss
compilation books so in summary the
input validity problem bites us as a
performance problem almost every time we
write a random tester it bites us in a
much more serious way when we have
software under test the lacs are
reliable validity checker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
