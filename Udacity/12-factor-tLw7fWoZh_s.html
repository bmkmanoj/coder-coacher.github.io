important concept for designing scalable
applications 12 factor apps you can
think of the 12 factors is best
practices for designing modern
applications that fit three really
important criteria portability
deployability
and scalability twelve factor
applications are designed to be portable
because they focus on eliminating
elements that vary between execution
environments like dependencies and
configuration not only that but twelve
factor applications are designed to be
deployed on cloud platforms like GCP AWS
and by focusing on keeping production
and development environments close to
uniform we can start continuously
deploying our applications meaning we
can set up tooling to roll out updates
to code very quickly finally if we
follow these principles when building
our applications they'll be able to
scale up to reach our users demands
while using most of the same toolings
and practices we've been employing from
the start now kelsey touched on a few of
the 12 factors earlier and how our
application handles them but there's a
lot more the ones we didn't handle
directly in our application we use
higher-level tools for later as you can
see when it comes to deploying apps at
scale into the cloud writing 12 factor
apps helps us reach that goal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
