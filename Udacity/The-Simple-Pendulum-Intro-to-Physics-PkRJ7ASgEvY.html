pendulum to measure time let's analyze
what's going on exactly with a pendulum
well pendulum is just a mass on a rod
and when we pull it back like we have
here away from the equilibrium position
what you have John in dotted lines well
it's going to swing back and forth and
if there's no friction or air resistance
it'll just do that forever what we
expect this pendulum to give a simple
harmonic motion which means we expect
that when we work out the forces in the
acceleration we want to get some
acceleration that looks like minus
something times X so let's look at the
forces and see if we can get that
because we want to understand what's
going on here well let's imagine pulling
our pendulum back by some angle theta
well of course our pendulum if it has
some mass and I said simple pendulum so
what that means I should explain is that
all of the mass is in the Bob at the end
which is just some really tiny little
point mass at the end and there's no
mass in the rod and everything is going
to spin or swing without friction the
pendulum has mass or weight pointing
down and well there's only one other
force that's the force of tension
supplied by the string or rod well I
know that when I release this pendulum
if I've pulled it back here and I
release it it's going to swing this way
down back towards the equilibrium so
actually what we want to do is break
this mg into a component this way that
will balance the tension and a component
in this direction this pictures starting
get a little cluttered so let me pull it
off to the side and make it a little
bigger well I can see that this angle is
the same as this angle was over here and
if that's the case well I can do my trig
this is a right triangle with a
hypotenuse and there's this side which
is mg cosine theta
besides pretty uninteresting because I
know it's going to exactly balance
tension how do I know that well because
the mass never accelerates towards the
pivot pointer away it only accelerates
perpendicular directly back towards the
equilibrium point and that force that's
doing this acceleration is mg times the
sine of theta okay so this is the force
actually I should say that it's negative
because well if I pull it back to the
left I would normally call that a
negative angle the forces to the right
this negative sign is actually important
okay so we have this force doing our
acceleration minus mg sine theta let's
see there good old friend F equals MA
well in this case minus mg sine theta
equals MA up and check it out the MS
cancel and we're left with this that the
acceleration is
to minus G times the sine of theta and
we're in a bit of a pickle here because
oh this does not look like a equals
minus something times X have no fear
we're going to do some sly massaging of
this equation to figure out what's going
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
