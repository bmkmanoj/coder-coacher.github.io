compare the coverage for different
inputs I'm going to use the input
through without markup as we've just
seen it i'm going to use food with HTML
markup and i'm going to use the same
enclosed in double quotes let's first
start with foo as we've just seen it
here the tagline is being executed
initialization of code initialization of
out is being executed we have the loop
over all characters we have the first
condition we have the second condition
and we have the third condition as we've
seen before none of these conditions
evaluates to true for any of the
characters in foo instead only adding
characters to out is being executed the
assertion finally passes now let's see
how this looks like for foo with markup
again the initialization is carried out
for this input as well as is the loop
however here this condition immediately
becomes true already in the first
character so tag is being set to true
too at the end of the tag tag is being
set to false again we also check this
condition but since we don't have any
quotes in there this line is never
executed and of course we add individual
characters the assertion in the end
passes now let's come to our input which
should trigger a failure that is the
same thing as before but now I closed in
double quotes again all of this is
executed no way to avoid this the first
thing that happens in here is that quote
is being set over here with the first
character and since quote is being set
these two conditions never hold and
everything including the tag characters
up here is being added to the output and
since the markup characters are being
added the assertion finally fails if you
look at the coverage up here you find
that there's one line in the program
whose execution correlates with failure
and this is precisely this line namely
quote equals not quote this line is only
executed in the failing run so all we
need in this situation is to look at the
governing condition and lo and behold we
do have the defect ah that was easy
wasn't it unfortunately things are not
always that easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
