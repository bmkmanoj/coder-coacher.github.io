multi-core versus single core processor
in a new technology suppose that in the
previous technology generation we got a
processor that has an area of two
centimeters squared it was achieving 2.5
instructions per cycle and it consumed
the hundred watts at two gigahertz
frequency and this is the highest power
that we can allow this processor to have
and this hundred watts is what we can
reasonably cool now let's say we get the
new technology where the same exact
processor would be half the area because
our transistors have shrunk because it's
the same design it's going to have the
same IPC and because transistors kept
shrunk we also reduce the power of this
processor when operating at the same two
gigahertz frequency as before now of
course because this processor is smaller
in the new technology than in the old
one if we want to do the best we can
with two centimeter square we have two
options our first option is a better
single core processor this processor
will be designed to occupy the entire
area that we have which is two
centimeter square it's a more
complicated processor that allows us to
achieve a IPC of 3.5 so it executes 3.5
instructions per cycle not 2.5 as the
old processor but because it's a fancier
processor and has more transistors it
spends 75 watts when operating at two
gigahertz so the question for you is
first if we allow this processor to
spend all hundreds that we can call what
is the frequency it can get in gigahertz
and if we do that what is the speed up
this better single core achieves versus
what we can get in the old technology
the second option we have in this new
technology is to simply put two cores on
this chip so it's going to be two cores
like this this is going to get us to
centimeters squared IPC is going to be
2.5
on each core and each core is going to
consume 50 watts at two gigahertz so we
get our entire budget spent by having
this course operated two gigahertz so
the question for you here is what's the
speed-up of this two core approach
versus the old technology assuming of
course that the old work can simply be
divided among the course so pretty much
having two cores allows us just to split
the same work that we had before on to
two cores without adding any new
instructions and without sacrificing the
IPC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
