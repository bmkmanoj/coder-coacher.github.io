methods the one that most people use is
referred to as row by row and it's sort
of classic algorithm and simple to go
through and there are some efficient
speed ups that were used so you could
run it quickly in industrial systems but
these days running your connected
components is really the thing that's
taking your time because the machines
have gotten much faster and the
algorithm itself is pretty
straightforward row by row so let's
start with a picture that looks like
this okay so we've got ones and zeros
and if you look carefully you'll see
there's really only one object here okay
those are all the ones and what we want
to do is we want to eventually determine
that all of them should be labeled as a
one okay but the system doesn't know
this yet all it knows is that there are
zeros and ones in the pixels all right
so here is the algorithm we start with a
with a variable at zero and what happens
is we go across okay and when we find a
new pixel if it's not connected to
anything before it or above it of course
there's no above and there's no before
we'll increment our counter all right so
we start labeling this one is a 1 and
then we go forward and then you're not
connected then we would get to here and
so what would that be labelled what
comes after one two okay so we label
that as a two so this is going to become
a 2 right and then goes over here and
then what are we going to get to we'll
get to next one what are we going to
label that 3 okay so that works fine the
reason that this one is listed as a 1
even though your skin it is it's
connected to the one above it you say oh
I'm connected someone likewise want to
get over here likewise when I go over
here it's connected to the one above it
so these are all labeled as one twos and
threes but you see where it says here
remember conflicts all right as I'm
going through when I'm labeling this
pixel okay I now have a conflict because
when I look behind me it says that I'm a
1 and when I look above me it says I'm
connected to a 2 so what I do is I pick
one of those maybe the one but I
remember that I've got a conflict there
likewise
conflict here and what I learn is that
one is the same as two because it's
connected there and one is the same as
three so it's connected there so after
I'm done labeling all of these and I've
got ones twos and threes Irie label
everything as a one because all the twos
get relabeled as one all the threes get
relabeled as one and that way the system
knows that there's exactly one object
and all the pixels with the ones are the
pixels from that object and it works
just like that and works great here's an
example from that CT cross-section I was
showing you before and you can see that
after some various other operations that
we'll talk about in a minute
it's out it's able to label these
different elements okay and what's nice
is those those elements have semantic
meaning to the radiologist who's who's
looking at these things you know it's
also useful for if you have some
clustering algorithms so here you are
seeing just some clustering pixels in in
a in a beach seal off that much of a
beach isn't no-dick okay must be the
northwest no sand just muck sorry
Seattle and you can see they're labeling
these different things using connected
components</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
