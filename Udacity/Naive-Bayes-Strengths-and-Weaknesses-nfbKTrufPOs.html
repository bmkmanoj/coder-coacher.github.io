of the naivebayes
learning algorithm that's quite amazing
there's one algorithm down two to go
what we'll do is we'll start a list now
of all the things that maybe you should
be thinking about when picking a
supervised classification algorithm so
that you have some basis for starting to
make a choice between the different
algorithms that we'll be talking about
so there are a few things that
naivebayes does really elegantly it's
actually really easy to implement it
deals well with great big feature spaces
between 20,000 and 200,000 words in the
English language and its really simple
to run it's really efficient there are a
few things that naivebayes doesn't do as
well you also want to be careful of yeah
so it can break it breaks in funny ways
so historically when Google first
started out when people searched for
Chicago Bulls which is a sports team
comprised of two words Chicago Bulls we
would show many images of balls of
animals and of cities like Chicago but
Chicago Bulls are something succinctly
different so phrases that encompass
multiple words never distinct different
meanings don't work very well in a space
so depending on exactly what the problem
is that you're trying to solve and the
data set that you have to solve it you
shouldn't think of supervised
classification algorithms as black boxes
you should be thinking about them in
terms of the theoretical understanding
of how the algorithm works and whether
that's right for the question you're
trying and you should of course tested
right so we talked about training set of
tests said you can check the performance
and test set and see how it works if you
don't like it it might be the wrong
other than what the wrong parameters
