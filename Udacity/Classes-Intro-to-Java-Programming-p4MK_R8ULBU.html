understand is the concept of classes
look at these dates here we have a date
the date of the Mariner 4 spacecraft
launch another date that happens to be
the inauguration of FD Roosevelt and a
third date
the date of the first lunar landing now
all of these objects have something in
common they're all day objects in Java
objects that have common behavior are
collected into classes so the day class
is the class that contains all of the
day objects and the reason you want to
know about this is when you want to find
out something about how days work you
will want to look at the documentation
of the day class it tells you how every
day object behaves let me give you
another example of a class here is a
string object and another and another
all these string objects have something
in common they all have the same
behavior and in Java the string class
defines what that common behavior is you
will learn a lot more about the string
class in this lesson let's go back to
our day class for a minute and think a
bit more what it means for objects to
have common behavior it means that they
can all do the same kinds of things like
what can they do as you've seen when you
played with days in bluej any day object
lets you get the month get to here or
add days to itself these actions are
called
the methods of the day class they are
the kinds of things that you can apply
to day objects to achieve some kind of
functionality the word method sounds a
bit strange at first and you should just
think of it as terminology it's just
what one calls the actions that you can
apply to any of the day objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
