like to mention that there's just you
know fYI there's different kinds of
verbs because what I'm looking for is
really action verbs so verbal verbs that
clearly express an action that can tell
me that you know what for example an
item could do okay not verbs that
represent for example relationships okay
okay so there and the ones that I've
identified and underlined here actually
I underlined complete sentences so that
it kind of we can look at the verbs in
in context and the first one is this
sentence that says that the library
might need to know or to calculate the
items that patron has checked out when
they are due and any outstanding overdue
fines so I would imagine that this is
representing a situation in which you
bring up patrons record and you start
looking up this information is that if
the patron often wants to know what they
have currently checked out or when
they're due or how much they're out or
how inviting another to mention that I
think you sent me one of the scenarios
you send me had to do with that right
with a patron coming in and asking for
this information so yeah and it makes a
lot of sense so what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna model this by adding these three
operations to the patron method the
first one I'm going to call items
checked out and basically is an
operation you don't need to you know
understand the implementation details
but when you call this operation it will
give you back exactly this information
so the items that are checked out by the
patron the second one I'm going to call
it when do they will tell you basically
when when an item is due and the third
one is gonna be called outstanding
overdue fines and you know as the name
says it's gonna tell you what are they
are standing overdue files for that
patron okay and as you might notice I
mean I'm gonna separate the the
attributes from the operations by having
a separate kind of sub rectangle so in
this way it's clear what is attributed
and what it was an attribute the
motional was an operation gotcha and let
me see then okay for the second one you
can see that the patron can check out
books and audio-visual materials so I
guess similarly you'll be looking at the
record for a patron that the patron will
give you an item and you will record the
fact that the patron is kind of checking
it out right and it is
operation related to this the
checked-out attribute that we did a
minute ago it is actually because what
will happen then again you know if you
jump ahead a little bit would be that
every time you invoke these operation so
I'm going to represent this as a check
out operation for the patron every time
you invoke this you will also have to
say something about the item and so we
will also flip kind of that that bit of
information in the in the in the item
okay okay and and finally here I can see
that the patron can request a book or an
audio/video item is not currently in so
I guess this is referring to items that
are already checked out but for which
there is interest is that right
so particularly the popular items the
patrons want to get on the list so that
they get notified when it comes back in
and I'll check it out I see I see okay
then I'm gonna do the same thing here
I'm gonna add this method which I'm
gonna call request and I'm gonna put it
here in the list of the methods in the
list of operations for therefore the
patron okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
