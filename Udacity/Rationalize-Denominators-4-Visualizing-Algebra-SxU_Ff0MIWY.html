root of a squared B to the fifth see to
the fourth all divided by B squared C
squared that's amazing algebra work if
you got any of that correct just like in
our last problem we want to increase the
power of each of these factors so that
way they're divisible by 6 this means we
need to change a to the fourth and to a
to the 6 b to the seventh and to be to
the 12th and see to the eighth and to
see to the 12th as well this means we
need to multiply it by the six root of a
squared B to the fifth see to the fourth
we know this since a to the fourth times
a squared is a to the 6 b to the seventh
times B to the fifth is B to the 12th
and see to the eighth times e to the
fourth is C to the 12th we multiply our
numerators together leaving 3a in front
of our radical next we simplify our
denominator as a B squared C squared we
just divide each of these powers by six
and finally we reduce a power of a since
a divided by a equals one this leaves us
with our final answer and notice that a
denominator does not contain a six route
anymore great work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
