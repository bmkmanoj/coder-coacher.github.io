participants took the pill the place at
which they slept because they all slept
in the sleep lab and what the pill looks
like it looked the same for both the
active and the placebo we did not
however control for gender and age we
can however minimize the impact of these
variables on their results let me
elaborate on this a little bit let's say
that only females were assigned to the
active pill and only males were assigned
to the inactive pill then if people who
took the active pill slept better we
wouldn't know if it was due to the
medication in the pill or maybe women
just sleep better than men in this
particular experiment we're not
controlling for these demographic
variables but we can minimize their
impact on our results through random
assignment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
