based processor works when we have
reservation stations for separate units
separately let's talk about unified
reservation stations so this is what we
had so far we had three reservation
stations for the ad unit and we had two
for the multiply unit this also does
subtract this also does divide and we
have seen it in at least one of our
examples that we can run out of these
reservation stations well we still have
plenty of these left however we still
couldn't issue instructions basically
once we cannot issue an instruction
because it needs one of these
reservation stations because issue needs
to happen in order we cannot issue any
of these either so until these
reservation stations become available we
cannot really use the available ones
here note that these reservation
stations are exactly the same except
that this one is feeding this unit and
this one is feeding this unit but the
logic in them is exactly the same they
are monitoring all of the results that
are broadcast capturing results and then
going to execution units so to improve
our ability to use the expensive
reservation stations we can go with the
so called unified reservation stations
approach where all of the reservation
stations are in one big array now when
we need to issue we need to grab one of
these reservation stations but it
doesn't matter which unit it is for
basically all of the reservation
stations that are equal so the benefit
of this is that as long as there are any
available reservation stations we can
issue instructions the drawback here is
that the logic for dispatching
instructions into this execution units
becomes a little bit more complicated
here for issue into the multiplication
we only need it to see whether one of
these is available and if one or more
are available select one meanwhile here
we are selecting one of these three and
sending it to the ad unit and if more
than one are available we have to figure
out just which one of the three here
however every cycle we need to select
one of these for the ad and one of these
for the multiply so we need to actually
consider which one of these are ads to
go here which one of these are
multiplies to go here and then every
cycle we need to select one of the ads
and one of the multiplies to go there so
the logic for dispatching becomes more
complicated here because we have more
reservation stations
to look at and we also for each unit
need to look at reservation stations
that just have wrong things for that
unit so we have to ignore them but again
reservation stations are very very
expensive so usually processors will use
some variant of this organization rather
than this one basically we don't have
each unit having its own reservation
stations typically a group of units will
have a reservation station so that we
can benefit from our reservation
stations if we have them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
