end of unit two so we define the
procedure get next target
that would take a page search for the
first link target on that page return
that as the value of URL that would be
the first output and also return the
position where the end of the quote is
so we know how to continue and then we
define the procedure print all links
that keeps going as long as we can as
long as there are more URLs on the page
it will find the next target store these
in the variables URL and in pause to
keep track of the location than this
string if there is a URL what we did was
just print it out and then we updated
the page to keep going what we want to
do to change this is instead of just
printing out each URL as we find it we
want to collect the URLs we want to have
a way to use the URLs so we can use them
to keep crawling to find new pages the
structure we've been learning about this
unit is the way to do that what we want
to do is keep all the URLs in a list at
the end of this procedure instead of
printing the links as we go we want to
have a list of all the links that we
found so this is what the current print
all links procedure does it takes the
page as its input and its output as
nothing it doesn't return anything all
it does is do some work prints out all
these links but we can't actually use
them at the end because it doesn't
return anything so what we want to do is
change this instead of print all links
what we want is to get all links we want
to actually have the links in a way that
we can use them so what we want instead
of printing all links is to actually get
the link so we'll change the name of a
procedure to get all links and instead
of outputting none what we want to do is
output a list of links and that should
be the list that corresponds to the
things that we were printing before but
now instead of just printing them we
want to output them as a list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
