starting unit 5 the topic of unit 5 is
weighted graphs I'd like to start off
with the little magic trick here's you
may have seen this sort of plastic ring
structure before this is these are
plastic rings that are used to hold
six-packs together and it turns out and
I'm not going to show you pictures but
you can find them on the internet
they're very sad that maybe Turtles can
get themselves stuck in these holes and
then as they grow they continue to grow
but the whole doesn't they can really
damage themselves very badly so it is
suggested that you cut your six-pack
rings so you actually introduce new cuts
into this plastic structure so that is
still connected so it's not a bunch of
little tiny pieces but there's no more
rings left in it and all the cuts have
to be across little pieces of plastic
not a long plastic or cross multiple
plastics at the same time but each
little bridges of plastic cut them and
what I'd like you to do well I mean let
me show you so earlier today I went to
the supermarket and they asked them if
they'd be willing to give me one of
these little plastic ring things in
particular apparently I got a very fresh
one because it's nice and flat just sits
here on the there so this wasn't
actually going to hurt any turtles
anyway better I should have gotten one
from the dump but I don't think my
friends at Udacity would have liked
trash on their on their nice little pad
here so okay so here is a ring thing and
what we want to do is make cuts in the
structure there's no rings left but the
thing is still in one giant piece okay I
did it now the end of the day your
plastic ring thing you should have a
series of cuts in it and look there's no
loops anyplace that there's a circle
that a turtle could get caught in I cut
it open but yet the thing is still in
one piece
alright so what you need to do is save
the turtles you need to cut the bridges
in this plastic structure so the plastic
stays in one piece but there's no loops
no turtle traps so you can make
whichever cuts wherever you want but
when you're done write the number in the
box don't tell me what it is just just
put it in a box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
