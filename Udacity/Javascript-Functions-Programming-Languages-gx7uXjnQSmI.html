in our formal grammar for JavaScript as
well as statements like the assignment
statement or the return statement or if
then else but we are not done there is
one last key element of a computer
program we need functions and this
splits into two parts we need to know
how to declare functions to list how
many arguments they take and what their
bodies are we also need to know how to
call functions in expressions we know
from experience that a Python program is
basically just a list of statements and
function definitions luckily for us a
JavaScript program is exactly the same
thing also a list of statements and
function definitions we sometimes call
statements and function definitions
elements because they're the key
elements of a program at the top level
so let's get started on the highest
level of our JavaScript grammar a
JavaScript program is either a single
element possibly followed by another
JavaScript program which is another
element so this ends up being a list of
elements and at some point we get tired
and stop writing in elements an element
can either be a function definition or
an arbitrary statement just like in
Python a function definition in
JavaScript starts with the word function
instead of the word def there's an
identifier that's the name of the
function you must have these parentheses
you can declare some optional parameters
in there maybe it's a function of one
variable X off to show you how to do
that in a minute and then the body of a
function is just a compound statement
which we've already seen that's a list
of statements terminated by semicolons
you can also just have statements at the
top level like print hello if you're
testing things out any statement you
want followed by a semicolon when we're
giving the definition for a function it
can have any number of formal parameters
that we decide could be a function of XY
and z could just be a function of a or
it could be a function of no parameters
that's why this is optional opt so an
optional parameter declaration could
either be some actual parameters this is
the common choice or nothing if we're
going to have one or more parameters
here's how it goes you can declare the
names of those variables it's a function
of X comma Y comma Z and after each one
you have to have a
until you get to the last one which is
not followed by a comma so we haven't
hinted on this previously but this is
kind of a cute gem in context free
grammars note that our statements are
terminated by semicolons in a compound
statement every statement is followed by
a semicolon by contrast to over here
with parameters they're separated by
commas so the last one doesn't have a
comma after it pretty cute we have all
the rules for expressions that we used
to have before but now we're going to
add function calls when you're calling a
function you have to give the function
name sign print abs Val and then you
pass in some number of arguments there
could be none which is why this says
optional or there could be one or more
you're going to see this play out in a
very similar pattern to opt params the
parameters in a function declaration
we're always just names like X Y or Z
and then you get to refer to them in the
function body but when you're calling a
function you can put in actual values
you can call sign of three so we can't
just reuse params we need to make a new
set of rewrite rules for actual
arguments so the arguments could be
nothing or it could be one or more
arguments if it's one or more arguments
they're going to be expressions
separated by commas so down here we had
function calls which are expressions you
could take sine of X and divide the
result by 2 and up here at the top
function definitions these happen more
rarely these are elements this is
actually pretty much it this is the
majority of our JavaScript grammar the
real devil is in the details for example
you may have noticed that nothing in
this grammar prevents you from declaring
sign as a function that takes one
parameter and then later on calling it
with two parameters Oh more on that
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
