actually we're done it's been kind of a
long road but we just covered a bunch of
material I apologize if I talk too much
I do that my kids tell me that all the
time but I think you got a bunch of good
grounding on the fundamentals of
computer vision we manipulated images as
functions everything from frequency
content to talking about filtering we
talked about how cameras and camera
models work that allow you to reason
about the geometry between multiple
views we talked about finding features
in one image and how you would find them
in another image so that you can relate
them either for doing image manipulation
doing recognition or just doing the
geometry talk a little bit about image
formation in terms of how the light
interplays with material in order to
make a picture to begin with we talked
about how in video images change and
motion happens and doing tracking then
towards the end we focused a bit more on
recognition classification and we talked
about how to do sort of more serious
work in that area you would have to know
more about machine learning and in fact
that's a good sort of jumping off point
for where you might go from here if you
actually want to do some high-end work
in computer vision involving recognition
classification labeling you probably
would have to get well grounded in
machine learning methods or at least
grounded enough that you could
understand the methods that are
currently being applied there's another
side in fact one of the other Udacity
georgia tech courses on computational
photography which thinks about the
manipulation of images with respect to
creating new images or thinking about it
sort of an advanced media perspective
and in particular even though this feels
like a somewhat comprehensive course in
computer vision if you were to sort of
go out there and you know try to do work
in a computer vision world there are
some things you'll see that you didn't
see we were very shall we say careful in
many of the images that we gave you
images are much less well behaved than
the images that we gave you and one of
the first things you find out is that
wow I wasn't getting the types of images
that I was expecting and so you have to
think a lot more about how you get the
images to be the way you want them to be
and then in order to do the computer
vision the flip side is consuming the
information that comes out of computer
vision right is that going to go into
some system that's going to
more reasoning about the nature of
what's going on are you going to set off
alarms or you're going to mark things
are you going to go shopping what's
going to be the output how is that
output going to be used so I'm sure at
this point you feel like you've learned
some stuff there is a lot more to do but
a lot of what needs to be done is really
the applications of these basic skills
to sort of the specific set of imagery
that you're working with so I hope you
will do some of that if you do and it
works well please send us a note I love
it when I hear students come back and
say you know I thought your class was ok
is kind of a lot of work but man am I
glad I took it because I'm now doing
this sort of imagery analysis of aerial
imagery and all of a sudden I find
myself using stuff that we learn so if
you have any of those experiences please
share them with us with me and we look
forward to talking to you again bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
