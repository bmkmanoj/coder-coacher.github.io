combustion here we're just looking at
one single cell at a time we're treating
each cell on its own and not looking at
the neighbors unlike as we did with the
fusion and with winds for this single
cell that we're currently looking at we
have to take two different quantities
into account the first is the
temperature which we already know its
measured in caravans the second is the
amount of water that can be burned
actually that should be something like a
density of which to be measured in
kilograms per square meter as the
combustion goes on in the cell thus
density is reduced possibly 20 and in
addition we can use this density to
model a variation in vegetation in a
thick forest the value of this density
goes up and at a location at which is a
clearing the value of this density goes
down now we have to distinguish between
two different cases first the
temperature is below the ignition
temperature which is something between
500 and 600 Kelvin and second the
temperature is above the ignition
temperature let me put an equal sign in
here to really cover all possible cases
even though in reality at this
temperature will never be exactly equal
to that ignition temperature when we are
below that point of ignition the amount
of wood does not change it's not burning
and now heat is being produced because
there is no combustion later on of
course the temperature is going to
change through diffusion through wind
and through heat loss but at the moment
I'm just looking at combustion in the
second case we do have combustion what
is burning so the rate of change of wood
with respect to time has to be negative
let's call that the burn rate and a
simple model for the burn rate would be
to say that it's proportional to the
current amount of which the more wood we
have the movie burn and we introduce a
time constant for the burning let's call
that T subscript B the larger this time
constant is the smaller the burn rate is
the less we burn thus time constant
describes so to speak the time it takes
to burn a specific amount of which now
we have to think about
in the second case wood is burning so
the temperature should be increasing and
that should be proportional to that burn
rate we need some proportionality
constant in here this is something like
the heating value converting from an
amount of wood to an increase in
temperature this is our simple model of
combustion now let's add the effect of
heat loss in all equations about the
rate of change of the temperature we
need to include heat loss which is plus
ambient temperature minus the current
temperature over the time constant for
that heat loss and the same when there's
combustion going on plus the ambient
temperature minus the current
temperature over the time constant for
that heat loss</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
