going to talk about fundamental GPU
algorithms part 2 we're going to start
with scan which we talked about last
week and look at specific applications
of scan and then we're going to turn to
looking at how to sort on a GPU so in
the last unit we learned about
fundamental GPU algorithms in the last
one and the most important one for this
lecture was scan scan is an efficient
way to paralyze a certain class of
parallel problems that otherwise seem
difficult to paralyze and we usually
refer to these as recurrence
relationships one of the use cases for
scan is for problems that keep some sort
of running total such as a running sum
but we can also use other binary
associative operators like Macs men and
most logical operations so as a quiz
let's recall two of the important
properties of scan so we're looking at a
scan of n elements and so in the best
GPU scan implementations what is the
amount of work to do the scan and what
is the number of steps to do the scan
your choices are proportional to log in
proportional to n proportional to n log
in and proportional to N squared so we'd
like you to check the box that
corresponds to what the work complexity
the algorithm is and what the step
complexity of the algorithm is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
