has operated only on numbers and in the
early days of computing people thought
of computers as super powerful
calculators for doing computations like
simulating nuclear weapons computing
ballistic tables or breaking encryption
which was a little more than just
arithmetic but still was mostly about
counting and doing simple arithmetic we
saw this quote from grace hopper earlier
talking about computers could only do
arithmetic and this is what people
thought about computers in the 1940s and
1950s but there's no reason to limit
computers to that they can operate on
any kind of data we want and it gets
much more interesting when we operate on
data besides just numbers if we're going
to build a search engine most of the
data we want to deal with is not numbers
it's the letters that are contained in
web pages and in Python that's what we
call a string a string is just a
sequence of characters surrounded by
quotes so here's an example of a string
and Python it starts with a single quote
has a sequence of characters and
anything we can type on the keyboard can
be in a string and ends with another
single quote the string is the sequence
of characters between the single quotes
if we want we can use double quotes
instead if we use double quotes then the
double quote starts the string we can
have a sequence of characters and a
double quote that ends the string the
only requirement is that if we start to
string with a single quote it has to end
with a single quote if we start the
string with a double quote it has to end
with the double quote and that's
actually a handy property because that
means we can have the other kind of
quote within our string the string
starts with a double quote it contains a
single quote inside it but because we
started with a double quote that single
note doesn't end the string that single
quote is just like another character in
the string the string continues until
the closing double quote so let's try
some things in the Python interpreter so
we can print a string just like we can
print a number so here I'm printing the
string hello and when we run this we see
the output hello it's printing hello we
don't see the single quotes as it prints
but we know that it's a string that was
printed we can print a string with
double quotes and one thing to notice
when you enter strengthen the trip
return
the color is black now since it's an
open string it hasn't been finished once
I type the final quote that closes the
string the color changes to blue so now
when we run this we have two prints both
that print hello it looks the same both
times it doesn't matter if we use single
quotes or double quotes around our
string just to check everyone's paying
attention i'm going to try one more
thing now imprinting hello without the
quotes try to see if you can guess what
that will do we won't make a quiz of
this but try to guess before I run it
now that I run this we see the result we
get a name error the name hello is not
defined without the quotes this looks
just like a variable it's a name but
it's a variable that we didn't define so
when I try to use it i get an error that
the variable name hello is not defined
if i wanted to i could define a variable
name hello let's make hello refer to the
string howdy and now when i print hello
it works i see the first two prints that
printed hello now when i print the
variable hello will that refers to the
string howdy and i see how D is the
result we usually don't want our
variables to start with capital letters
that's just a convention so i'm going to
change this back to a lowercase hello
because it makes me feel uncomfortable
to have a variable with a capital letter
there's no rule against that in python
is just a convention that we like to
follow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
