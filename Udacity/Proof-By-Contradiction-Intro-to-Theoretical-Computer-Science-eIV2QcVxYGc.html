that the halting problem is undecidable
is by using a technique known as a proof
by contradiction which means that i will
first assume that the halting problem is
in fact decidable and then show you that
this assumption leads to an unresolvable
contradiction so let's start out by
assuming that the halting problem is in
fact decidable so it follows directly
from the assumption that the halting
problem is decidable that there must be
some algorithm for the halting problem
now this algorithm can be very
sophisticated very complicated
whatsoever but since the halting problem
is decidable or since we assume that the
halting problem is decidable we can
directly conclude from this assumption
that there must be some algorithm
solving it no matter what the program no
matter what the input so now that we
assume that we have this whole algorithm
what we're now going to do is something
sneaky and this will lead us to the
proof by contradiction we're going to
write a program that uses this algorithm
here and this program I call inverse
halt and it's a finest following so
inverse halt takes as input a program so
not a program and input but just the
program and then it calls the halt
algorithm with two inputs so the first
input is again the program just as in
hold but it also gives the program
source code itself if you will as an
input to hold so it's basically the
question of what happens if I give a
program its own program code as an input
and the way this then reacts is the
following if all says the program when
it's fed its own code will stop then
inverse halt that's why I call it
inverse halt will go into an infinite
loop so if program stops on being fed
itself then in verse hold of that
program will not stop it will not halt
if on the other hand hold determines
that program given itself as an input
would not stop so go into an infinite
loop then this whole program here
inverse halt would in fact terminate and
we're guaranteed in this case that the
overall program inverse halt will
terminate because we know that halt is
guaranteed to terminate after all it's a
valid algorithm that solves the halting
problem for any program and any input
now we're almost there there's just one
more step missing to arrive at our proof
by contradiction and that is that
we now run the following program so
we're almost ready to approve by
contradiction and to actually conclude
the proof will now consider the
following program we run inverse hold
with inverse halt as an input so it's
kind of similar to up here we consider
inverse halt in two ways this one up
here is the program inverse halt that we
actually run and this year is inverse
halt if you will it's the source code of
inverse halt that we want to analyze so
it's similar to appear again we're
considering a program both as an actual
algorithm but also the description of
that algorithm and what we're now going
to show is that inverse halt when given
a verse hold as an input is going to
basically choked on itself and of course
we're going to do this as a quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
