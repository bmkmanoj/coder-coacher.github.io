write it down is that a must consider
the sort of worst-case
counter-strategy by B right I see
because when a chooses the row then B
was going to make things bad for a along
that row so that's the counter strategy
right and in fact when you decided to do
it the other way with B well B has to do
the same thing B has to consider the
worst case counter as well and in this
particular case the way we've set it up
where the values for a a is always there
for trying to maximize and B is always
trying to minimize a which works out to
be the same thing as maximizing itself
does that make sense yeah I mean other
than the fact that you know I name my
first child max I really wanted to name
my second child min that actually would
have been pretty cool why didn't you do
that because I'm married to someone with
more sense than I have yeah I understand
I completely understand okay so a is
trying to maximize B is trying to
minimize they both have to consider the
worst case that the other will do and so
what that's going to do is it's going to
force them to go through exactly the
process you went through which is figure
I'm gonna make the choice so that my
opponent makes the counter choice the
worst case choice I will end up as best
as I can so a is going to basically try
to find the maximum minimum and B is
trying to find the minimum maximum in
fact that strategy has a name or that
way of thinking about it has a name what
do you think it's called the minimum
maximum yes or minimax which is a movie
production company I think no that was
Miramax do you recall that where you've
seen minimax before Michael in some
other class that she once taught or once
took years and years ago
now minimax was exactly the algorithm
that we use for game search in intro dia
Oh which was a game tree which is just
what we started with in this case even
though we turned it into a matrix
exactly so in the end we you know this
matrix induces a game tree if you want
to think about it that way or game tree
induces a matrix if you want to think
about it that way and the strategy then
in sort of basic AI search and the
strategy and game theory is minimax when
you're in a two player zero-sum game of
perfect information so is there a way to
do alpha beta pruning on this alpha beta
pruning does is gives you a more
efficient way of finding the answer I
see but it's the same answer no matter
how you set it up right that's right
okay so this is pretty cool so we have
set up a kind of game where we have
multiple agents you know at least two
agents in this case who have different
strategies and we actually sort of know
you know sort of in a world where it's a
zero-sum game and you know the other
person is trying to minimize what you
get maximize what they get that the
minimax strategy would actually give you
sort of an answer in this case by the
way we say that the value of this game
for a is 3 if a does the rational thing
and B does the rational thing that is
trying to maximize their own value you
will end up in this situation that's
kind of cool don't you think
very cool feel like there should be a
theorem there is in fact a theorem I'm
going to write it down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
