browsers we're gonna go to reddit and
we're gonna go to reddit.com so this is
gonna load read its front page expressed
in JSON which is something we've
implemented on reddit so computers can
you know browse reddit and people can
write third-party software that uses
reddit and so when you add that JSON to
read it you get this wall of text which
brings us to our next quiz okay in this
quiz what I've done for you is I have a
variable called reddit front which is
what I just showed you from the browser
it's red its front page expressed in
JSON now this is actually quite a lot a
bit of data I look at my scroll bar it's
a very long line you don't don't worry
about too much about that just know that
it is a string a JSON string of bread
it's front page now what I'd like you to
do use the JSON library to parse this
string find in there the links it's kind
of a deep data structure you can copy
and paste this into you know a Python
editor if it makes a little bit easier
you need to find the links in each link
has an upset rebuked and what I want you
to do is write a function called total
UPS which returns the total number of
UPS you know the sum of all of the ups
of all the links in this list now there
isn't anything else in this list that
has UPS so basically if you can find
every instance of the key value pair ups
and value add them all up and return it
I just want to test your ability to load
this JSON and manipulate it a little bit
okay good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
