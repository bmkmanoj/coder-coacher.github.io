course developer at Udacity and I work
on the Iowa snana degree and we're here
at all comp 2016 talking to the speakers
and people are at the event just
learning about their stories of how
they've gotten into development and
we're here with Elvis Nunez hi thanks
for being with us Elvis thanks Steve
free invite me absolutely could you tell
us a little bit about yourself your kind
of journey to iOS development yeah sure
I used to study software engineering
back in Peru after a while courses in
South America go a bit slow because they
tried to catch up with what's going on
to the rest of the world so when you
actually get the course you're it behind
so I started looking for different ways
to learn and I found the Apple course
about iOS development in one I think was
Apple like I can remember ready so sorry
so I started doing that and after a
while I started practicing on my own
maybe a couple of books but there wasn't
really a lot of material at a time what
advice would you give to we have a lot
of students around the globe to working
maybe outside of your home country or
just how to approach that whether it be
in the States or you know anywhere else
I think the first thing is don't be shy
about learning English there are still a
lot of resources in Spanish but he
doesn't get you all the way there my
just get you started but having English
is probably the first thing you should
try on outside of English what is a any
other skills that you probably identify
as being something you need to know to
kind of get your first job as iOS
developer try out different things
reddit Isis totally fine funny apps that
useful it's important for a lot of
companies to see what you've done and
especially like if it's in the absurd
because it proves you that you can
actually finish things which is one of
the most difficult skills you have it
doesn't matter if it's use a small thing
that takes you a week or something it
takes you an
a month it's important you have a
problem and I would say that's the best
way to learn have a problem absolutely
so what was the first step that you ever
built I was a to-do manager uh-huh I
think that's pretty common is so I
wanted to have what to do for myself so
this week there's a lot of announcements
coming out at dub dub DC is there
anything in particular for you that
you're excited to try out next I'm
actually really excited about the Swift
playground I think you'll open the door
for many developers around the world to
start doing this in countries like South
America getting a mac can be with more
expensive than just having an ipad also
for kids a lot of parents don't really
think about getting a mac but having a
tablet I think a lot of parents might
consider that it could be a good way to
start on Swift by having an ipad would
Swift be a language that you'd recommend
to people just getting into programming
ha totally I have been programming
around six languages already and they
all have this preconception or theories
that you have to know in advance like
let's say see that has a memory
management so before doing something as
simple as a they say like a Tetris game
you have to learn about memory
management and that's a huge block in
front of you that you have to overpass
before actually learning how to program
but she doesn't have that it's quite
simple straightforward also it helps you
that it's type safe so you don't have to
hit the wall too many times you sort of
takes you by the hand and move on with
you I think it's a great language for
people are starting and also for people
that are really experienced now for you
on the topic of Swift you work on apps
that are both Swift objective-c
exclusively one of the other or ones
that interrupt I have been working on
the active see until
if 2.0 was released after Swiss to put
on what released I have been doing 50
full-time how do you really look back
everything yeah is there a particular
aspect of building either iOS apps or
just absent general that you enjoy the
most like some some part of that process
for me the most important thing or the
most fun part is to solve the problem to
figure out what's the best interface
that we can have I how many buttons can
we remove in order to solve this problem
like if an app can be used a huge button
that you press and then boom that's for
me that's the goal so I have a lot of
fun brainstorming how we can solve the
problem in the different interfaces that
we can have is there a particular device
that you like working for out of the
others like a watch or pad or the phone
or just all of them I think definitely
is the iphone yeah i think the watch is
nice and maybe TV also but it doesn't
have as many users as the phone because
i believe like the apps for those
platforms have to be extremely simple I
mean what with the iphone you can have
some liberties can make it a bit more
complex can you speak to it all kind of
how to work in groups of a lot of our
students you know a lot of us are just
in general work in isolation for some
time when we're learning but at some
point you have to collaborate with other
engineers and especially since you have
experience doing that kind of
international way what if us would you
give the students for working together
with other engineers i would say getting
into open source is a great way to start
because then you get to collaborate with
people and people that are really
passionate about building things at work
it's also nice to try to collaborate
thing many companies have one up and one
engineer so collaboration can be a bit
hard but in open source is usually
like whoever has the time to do it we'll
do it right so I would say that's a
great way to start and I would say
that's pretty much how I started
collaborating to is if there was one
kind of summarizing statement
encouragement to a new student that you
could give would you tell find a protein
and figure out how to solve it yeah
speaking of problems has there ever been
just like what is the biggest problem
you've ever had to solve or like you
know like a really frustrating of point
in your iOS development career and how
did you overcome it I think the most
difficult problem was to take to not
overthink things is quite easy when
you're making or when you're solving a
problem to try to go beyond what you
actually need and that usually drags you
down and doesn't help you to move
forward try different things so I would
say don't make it perfect at the
beginning but just make it work then
just be the right over it eventually go
get better so also one of our students
is asked when you get stuck in a rut a
really hard problem and in this
particular case I've been stuck on the
problem for a couple days and they just
can't seem to get over it what have you
done to kind of get yourself unstuck and
get going again just taking a break I
know a lot of people say this but also
it actually works taking a break you
should use clear your mind and when
you're back to proteins you should
resolve other thing is just asking other
people that have been into the same part
or like photos like stackoverflow helped
a lot just by grinding your problem also
helps you a lot to fix it so i will say
you start by asking you what's really
wrong about this maybe you're solving
the wrong problem what do you do to
clear your mind all you should use take
my dog out watch some TP that's great
advice well thanks so much for first
taking the time to speak with us we
really appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
