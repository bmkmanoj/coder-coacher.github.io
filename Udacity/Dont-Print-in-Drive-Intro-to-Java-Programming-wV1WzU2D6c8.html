the car class and the simulation class
in the car class we now return an
ArrayList which is allocated here we add
a passenger true that ArrayList whenever
one has reached its destination and all
the way in the end we return that
ArrayList as the return value of the
method did you modify the javadoc to add
an aunt return statement if so pat
yourself on the back in the drive cars
method we call the dr method that
returns an ArrayList for each person in
that ArrayList we print a drop off
message note that I didn't even bother
to save the return value of the drive
method in a variable you can of course
and you may find that makes the code
easier to understand but here I say sedo
drive returns an arraylist and for every
person in that ArrayList i do something
with this loop now we have achieved the
goal of our reorganization the car class
no longer knows anything about system
dot out the simulation class does but
that doesn't bother me so much because
the simulation class also needed to know
about system dot in to read the user
input so the simulation class deals with
input and output the car and the person
class are blessedly unaware of that
congratulations for having worked
through such a complex example real-life
code does look like that with lots of
classes and in the next unit you will
see the Java way of organizing related
classes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
