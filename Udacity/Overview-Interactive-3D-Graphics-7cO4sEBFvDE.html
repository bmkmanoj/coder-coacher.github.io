and means a dramatic change such as I
saw the cube transform into a unicorn I
won't be using that form I'll be using
it as a noun
where transform is a mathematical term
meaning an operation that changes the
position orientation or size and shape
of an object transforms are a key part
of computer graphics in these lessons
I'll be explaining how transforms work
you probably didn't realize it but
you've already been using transforms in
a few of the previous exercises when you
set the position of an object you were
using a type of transform called a
translation we use transforms whenever
we animate anything objects lights or
cameras we're going to spend a fair bit
of time on transforms since they allow
us to do so much the study of transforms
for computer graphics is associated with
the field of linear algebra this field
is concerned with vector spaces and is
usually considered a prerequisite for
any computer graphics programming course
if you know a bit about linear algebra
great having a deeper and wider
understanding of the subject will help
however basic computer graphics needs
just a few small bits of theory to get
things going Michael in these lessons
ahead is to teach you the tools you'll
need to quickly and effectively be able
to control your virtual world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
