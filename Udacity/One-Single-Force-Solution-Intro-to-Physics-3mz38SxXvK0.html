this ratio to sort of figure out what's
going on with f2 and here I've called
the radius for f2 twice the initial
radius r 1 i've made the exponent
negative 2 because it's proportional to
1 over r squared so the two comes from
being R squared and the negative comes
from this being in the denominator when
we work this out we find that f2 is only
one-quarter of f1 but I'm still confused
how could a force be neutrally
attractive so that means that this Apple
will be drawn to the center of the earth
which is exactly below it so the force
will go that way and the force on the
moon will also be towards the center of
the earth how could a force pointing
inwards caused an object to move in a
circle it seems like maybe you'd want to
force that pointed that way or that way
let's do a little thought experiment
with this Apple and maybe that will help
us see how an attractive force could
actually cause an object to perhaps move
in a circular path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
