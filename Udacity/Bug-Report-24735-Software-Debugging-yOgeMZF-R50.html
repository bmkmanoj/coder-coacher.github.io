debugging let's take a look a software
problem Mozilla is the cooperation that
produces the well-known Firefox browser
in the early days of the browser Mozilla
was still in beta and they got lots and
lots of problem reports from the early
customers he is bug report number 20
4735 you already see from the number
that they got very very many bug reports
what would happen here is that a user
would start the Mozilla browser would go
to the website bugzilla mozilla org
which actually holds all the bug reports
including this one in mozilla the
browser would render the bugzilla web
page there would be a link search for
bug and users would click on it and then
number of menus would appear say
selecting the operating system priority
or severity where you would be able to
enter or select search terms before
pressing the big search button if the
user would now with this bugzilla page
open select print from the menu then the
entire browser would crash with a
segmentation fault such bug reports were
not exactly uncommon in the early days
of mozilla there would always be some
HTML input that would come from the web
server and then be rendered as a web
page which the browser could probably
handle let's take a look at the HTML
code for bugzilla mozilla.org</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
