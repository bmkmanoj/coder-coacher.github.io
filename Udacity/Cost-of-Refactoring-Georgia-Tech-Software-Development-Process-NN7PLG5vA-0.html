refactoring refactoring might be free or
almost free if you're using a tool to do
refactoring as we did in our demo but
that's not always the case in many cases
refactoring involves quite a bit of
manual work if you're doing some manual
refactoring and how much that cost
depends on how well the operations on
the source code are supported you may
have partial support from your IDE you
may have complete support in which case
is great or you might have no support in
which case you have to be very careful
about how you change your code and how
you check that you didn't change the
behavior of the code there's also an
additional cost associated with
refactoring remember that refactoring
relies heavily on testing after each
small step of refactoring so you might
have to develop test cases specifically
to check your refactoring and even if
you have an existing test suite because
for example you're working some agile
context and therefore you develop a lot
of unit test cases before writing your
code and therefore you have a good
regression test with that you can use
every time you modify your code
nevertheless when you refactor and you
change your code you might need to
update your tests so it's not only the
development of the test cases but also
it's maintaining the test cases and if
you have a lot of test cases you have to
maintain more test cases so that's a
cost that is not directly visible but
can affect quite a bit the overall cost
of refactoring and the overall cost of
the system development therefore and
finally you should not underestimate the
cost of documentation maintenance
applying refactoring my involve changes
in interfaces names for example names of
classes and when you make this kind of
changes you might need to update the
documentation and that's all so cost is
something that takes effort and
therefore should be considered</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
