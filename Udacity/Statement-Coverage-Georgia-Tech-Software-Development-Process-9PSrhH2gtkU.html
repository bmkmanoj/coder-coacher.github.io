box testing I'd like to start talking
about specific coverage criterion and
I'm going to start with the first one
which is statement coverage this
criterion is going to be characterized
by two aspects the first one is which
are the test requirements for the
criterion and the second one is how we
measure coverage for that criteria in
the case of statement coverage the test
requirements are all the statements in
the program so this is the basic the
first the simplest coverage criterion in
the white box arena let me remind you
the assumption that we made at the
beginning white box testing is based on
the assumption that if there is a faulty
element in the code we need to exercise
it we need to execute it in order to
find a fault
and that's exactly what statement
coverage does if there is a statement
that is faulty in the code we need to
exercise it in order to find a fault and
therefore a good measure of how well we
exercise the code is the ratio of the
number of executed statements so all the
statements the my test case is executed
to the total number of statements in the
program the higher this number the
better I exercise my code and we can
also look at the coverage criterion in
terms of questions so what is the
question they were trying to answer when
we look at the specific set of test
cases and we assess the statement
coverage that they achieved and the
question is whether each statement in
the program has been executed so
statement coverage is satisfied when all
the statements in the program have been
executed and we can satisfy two
different degrees and the degree to
which is satisfied is measured by this
value so now let's go ahead and measure
statement coverage on our print some
example what I'm going to show down here
is this progress bar in which we showed
the amount of coverage the percentage of
coverage achieved so what this means is
that if I get to this point that I cover
25% of the statements in the code and my
goal is to get up here to cover all the
statements in the code we have two test
cases for this code the first one that
we just saw consists of the inputs a
equal to three and B equal to nine and
the second one has the inputs a is equal
to minus five and B is equal to minus
eight so now let's see what happens when
we run this this case when we run this
this case I'm going to show you by
highlighting in the code the parts of
the cover when we start executing the
code we cover the first statement then
we always execute the second statement
which computes the result we continue
the execution we get to the if statement
if a result is greater than zero in this
case our result is 12 because that we
are working with the inputs three and
nine and therefore we execute that
through part of the if we execute the
statement and at this point we just jump
to the end because we do not execute the
else part of the statement since we have
the executed through one and therefore
we cover this final statement so at the
end of the execution of this test case
we cover one two three four five
statement out of seven which is roughly
speaking seventy one percent so we can
mark in here that we more or less cut to
71 percent of coverage for this code now
let's look at what happens when we
execute test case number two in this
case again we execute the first
statement the second statement the third
statement in this case though the third
statement when it evaluates the value of
result it sees that result is not
greater than 0 because our inputs are
minus 5 and minus 8 therefore it will
execute line number 5 and because the
result is less than 0 it will also
execute line number 6 so at this point
all the statements in our code are
executed and therefore we achieved 100%
statement coverage which was our goal
before looking at other kinds of
coverage let's see how statement
coverage is used in practice
first of all statement coverage is the
most use the kind of coverage criterion
in industry normally for company that
uses statement coverage the typical
coverage target is 8090 percent which
means that the outcome of the test
should be such that 80 90 percent of the
statements are exercised at the end of
the testing so at this point you may be
wondering why don't we just shoot for a
hundred percent why don't we try to
cover all the code we just saw that we
can do it and so I'm going to ask you
the same question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
