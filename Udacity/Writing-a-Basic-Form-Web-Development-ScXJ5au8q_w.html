little mini lesson we're gonna do
talking about how to use templates and
we're going to spend a lot of time today
in our editor and browser basically
working together to build a few
templates in a simple web application so
let's start with what a basic web
application looks like here we have a
basic little web application this is
effectively the hotel world homework
that you did from lesson from the first
lesson and you know as you can see it
doesn't really do much it's got one
handler on slash called main page which
is here and all it does is it prints the
string hello Udacity I've made my main
page Handler inherit from a class called
handler which I have to find up here and
this just adds one method called right
and all right is it just lets me print a
string without having to type self
response that out that right I can just
type in self dot right and we'll be
adding a few more helper functions to
this handler as we go so we've got this
basic file here we've got this basic app
tamil you know nothing nothing crazy
here this is this should all be familiar
to you by now let's go ahead and make
sure this works we'll go to our terminal
I'm in the template list the directory
where these files are as you can see
we'll run the app server like so I I
prefer to run the app server from the
terminal so I can just see what's going
on and I can kill it easily it's telling
me we're running at localhost 8080 so
let's go ahead and check that out on our
browser we'll go to localhost 8080 load
this page and we see our text that I
typed hello Udacity let's just make sure
everything is working as expected I'm
just going to change the string adding a
few exclamation marks I'll save this
file and then we'll go back to our
browser and reload and just make sure
that everything is working end to end
okay here I am in the browser I reload
my extra exclamation marks appeared so
we're all good there now this lesson I'm
gonna ask you lots of questions like
what happens when you do X or Y or
whatever so try to follow along with me
at
we go now that I'll kind of keep things
going smoothly now you'll remember if
from the end of your homework from
lesson two where we made a basic form if
you want to make basic form we can just
return HTML directly from our handler
here so I'm going to add a quick string
that represents an HTML form I'm going
to start with the triple quoted string
this is basically the Python syntax for
a multi-line string anything I typed
between these two triple quotes will
just be a part of a string and including
other quotes and such so it makes it
typing HTML a little bit easier okay so
a form tag remember that just starts a
form a little h2 tag that'll just add a
little title an input box type text and
we'll give it the name food and a button
to add this food now it looks like we're
building some sort of food or shopping
with sort of thing and indeed we are
what kind of build there as we go but
for right now we're just going to start
with this basic form so I've entered my
form HTML let's make sure that our app
returns this HTML in fact I'm going to
rename this form HTML so it's a little
bit easier to see down here so let's
replace this text with form HTML and
we'll give this a whirl in the browser
reload the page and I see a basic form
now recall that since we didn't set a
method on that form the default method
is going to be get which means when I
submit this form it'll just add that
parameter to the URL and let's go ahead
and see that work okay so I typed in a
food in the text box and when I hit
enter the page reloaded with the food I
just entered in the URL our first quiz
is going to be when I type in a new food
in this text box and hit add what
happens when I submit a new food in the
text box what happens choose the correct
answer the food parameter in the URL
updates to match our new food do we see
a second food parameter in the URL so I
have both steak and eggs in URL or thus
a browser report an error</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
