this okay so I guess the first thing to
do is if you look at the table you have
at the bottom it tells us what the truth
tables are for hand and XOR so we know
that boolean functions can all be
represented as combinations of and or
and not so I'm going to recommend that
you fill out that empty column you have
with or all right so or is like that
right and you'll notice if you look at
and or an XOR that or looks just like
XOR except at the very last row in a
second okay good huh and in that row
right and and on the other hand tells us
a 1 only on the last row so what I'm
going to suggest that we really want
that last node to do in your drawing is
to compute the or of x1 or x2 and
produce the right answer except in the
case of the last row which we only want
to turn off when and happens to be true
so really what that node is is computing
or minus and all right so how do we make
this or minus n so the way we did or
before well we did it a couple different
ways but one is we gave weights of 1 on
the two inputs and then a threshold of 1
and that made you know ignoring
everything else at the moment this unit
will now turn on if either x1 or x2 are
on and otherwise it'll stay off right so
what's the worst case the lowest value
that you can get is when one of those is
one and one of those is zero which means
that the sum into those will be in fact
one yeah right so if the and comes out
as being true it's going to give us some
positive value so if we just simply have
a negative weight there that will
subtract out exactly in the case when
and is on that's not going to quite give
us the answer we want but it's a good
place to start to think about it all
right so like just a negative weight
like negative one mm-hmm
all right so does that work not quite
all right and why doesn't it work
because if well certainly when and is
off then we really are just getting the
or that's all good but if both x1 and x2
are both on then the sum here is going
to be two minus the one that we get from
the end which is still one so minus one
isn't enough - what both maybe we can do
more than that
maybe we can do minus 2 what happens if
we do minus 2 then we've got x1 and x2
if they're both on then we get a sum of
1 minus 2 plus 1 or 0 which is less than
our threshold so it will output 0 and in
the other two cases right when end is
off then it just acts like or so this
actually kind of does the right thing
it's it's actually or - kind of n times
2 right there you go
and of course there's an infinite number
of solutions to this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
