size at which you want to draw a texture
is different from the size the texture
actually is for instance this Center
image is the actual size of the Giga gal
texture that's one pixel in the texture
is one pixel on the screen but we have
two very different ways of drawing Giga
gal at six times your normal size the
way we choose the color of the extra
pixels that are added when we scale up a
texture is called filtering on the left
we're using nearest neighbor
interpolation that is to say that we
just pick the nearest pixel in the
original image to figure out what color
to color a new pixel over here we're
using linear filtering which uses a
linear combination of the nearby pixels
to select a new color basically
averaging now in most cases especially
if you're only making the texture a
little bit bigger linear filtering will
tend to preserve more detail but it's
also a little bit more costly from a
graphics point of view however since all
the textures for Giga gal are in this
pixel art style will be using nearest
neighbor interpolation or nearest
neighbor filtering for it most of this
class libgdx provides a third type of
filtering called MIT mapping and that is
where it pre computes a bunch of
versions of the texture at different
scales this is most useful when the size
of a texture is going to be changing
dramatically over the course of a game
which mostly happens in 3d applications
so we're not going to worry about it
