another thing that the service provider
has to worry about is online evolution
and growth of the service because
services are evolving continuously the
gmail that you're accessing for getting
your email today may not be the same
that you accessed a month back so since
the services are continuously evolving
the servers at the data centers have to
be upgraded with the new version of the
software or maybe new nodes are being
added or maybe all the old loads are
being retired and brand new nodes are
being brought in to serve the user
community whether it is hardware or
software upgrade that needs to be done
that has to be done with the
understanding that while that upgrade is
happening there's going to be loss of
service again the DQ principal comes in
handy in measuring what exactly is the
loss that we are observing of the
service when we do this kind of online
evolution and growth the first choice is
what is called fast reboot that is bring
down all the servers at once upgrade
them and then turn them back on so this
diagram is showing you time on the
x-axis and the loss DQ loss on the
y-axis and what you're seeing here this
is the time for the upgrade per node so
the amount of time and load is going to
be down in order to do that upgrade
whether it is a software upgrade at a
hardware upgrade and this y-axis segment
is the DQ loss per node so if I bring
down a node and upgrade it it's going to
be down for some amount of time and this
is the amount of server capacity that is
lost the DQ that is lost as a result of
one server being down if all the servers
are down which is what is happening with
fast reboot then for this entire time
the area bounded by this green shaded
rectangle we're going to have no service
the ideal is here in terms of the total
amount of DQ we want
and the axis is saying how much is the
DQ that is lost and what we are saying
is if we do this fast reboot that fast
reboot is going to bring all the
server's down for a certain amount of
time that it takes to upgrade them and
for the entire duration the service is
unavailable this idea of fast reboot is
particularly useful in situations where
we can use diurnal server property for
instance if you think about services
that are being all across the globe we
can use factors such as oh this is night
time for the user community and the
users have probably gone night night and
therefore they are not going to access
the service this is a good time to bring
down the whole service and upgrade the
service so that might be a situation
where fast reboot is very useful so we
are assuming that the user community is
segmented so that they are directed to
geographically different locations and
we can use the diurnal server property
to do this off-peak fast reboot of
chosen replicas of the services in this
figure so in this figure this segment
that I'm showing you here is the DQ loss
per node and the total DQ loss is of
course n times d q where n is the number
of servers that are undergoing this fast
reboot so in other words for you units
of time that is complete loss of DQ with
fast reboot an alternative to fast
reboot is what is called a rolling
upgrade now here what we're doing is
rather than bring all the server's down
at the same time we are bringing one
server down at a time and upgrading one
server bringing down the next server
upgrading it and so on this is what is
called rolling upgrade or wave upgrade
and in this case service is available
all throughout there is no time that we
are saying that the service is
completely unavailable but for the
entire duration of time the duration of
time here is n times you because you is
the upgrade time per node
and the upgrade because it is a wave
upgrade is going to last for n times you
time units where n is the number of
servers being upgraded in this fashion
but during that entire time service is
available but in every you units of time
there's a DQ loss of this much bounded
by this area during the entire upgrade
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
