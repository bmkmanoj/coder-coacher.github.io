ago and he made important contributions
in math physics engineering and
astronomy in physics Archimedes was the
first to explain the principle of the
lever which we will be talking about
quite a bit in the third unit he mented
an ingenious device known as the
Archimedes screw which could be used to
move water from low places too high
many of his inventions were actually
used to defend Syracuse which in his day
was frequently attacked he created
catapults and ballistas which could fire
projectiles huge distances when enemy
ships attacked
he's even rumored to have constructed a
heat ray which used mirrors on the
bluffs of Syracuse to focus the sun's
rays on an attacking ship in math
Archimedes was able to calculate the
area under a parabola this is a shape
that we will be using extensively in the
next unit he defined the Archimedes
spiral which you can learn more about
one of the challenge homework problems
in this unit but the discovery that he
was most proud of was his proof that a
sphere inscribed in a cylinder has
exactly two thirds the volume and
surface area of the cylinder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
