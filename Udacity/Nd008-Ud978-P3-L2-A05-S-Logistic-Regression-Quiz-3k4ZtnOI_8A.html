out is how our model changes based on
removing variables from the analysis to
figure this out you just need to remove
variables that have too many categories
within one predictor variable so how do
you actually do this what I'm going to
do is start with what we have built out
already which is the input data tool
connected to our select tool which is
connected to our create samples tool
after this part I'm going to work and
tweak our actual model the first thing
I'm going to do is they're going to
bring in a field summary tool to look at
the categorical variables with how many
unique values they have within them what
I'm going to do is actually just look
for the results for only my different
categorical variables so my customer
segment my income redeemer region status
region and status fields I'm then going
to bring on a browse tool after the eye
or interactive result if you look at
these different categorical variables we
can see that the customer segment income
and region fields all have way too many
different categories to effectively use
with our logistic regression model the
way to deal with this is either combine
them into a fewer number of groups or we
should simply just deselect all of it
for our model so in this situation what
I ask you to do is if there's more than
four categories let's just deselect and
not use that field for our logistic
regression but what I do want to notice
is that our redeemer field and status
fields those fit the category and
they're good to go so let's now deselect
that field summary tool I'm going to go
back to our predictive category and
bring in a logistic regression tool
named the model and just like before i'm
going to select my target variable as a
redeemer field and and then my different
potential predictor variables which i'm
going to choose as spend status stays
per year totaled a staid and years of
loyalty let me run this model now
reducing the total number
of different potential predictor
variables and let's view if the results
change at all as you can see the
r-squared value is now at 0.58 65 and as
well we have three statistically
significant predictor variables not
including the intercept value this is
definitely one very valid way to
determine the optimal predictor
variables yet it is a very manual and
time-consuming process now what we're
going to do is leverage the stepwise
regression technique to automate this
process</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
