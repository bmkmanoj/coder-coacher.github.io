because we can use it to concentrate
just on the fastest-growing part of a
function and even leave out all of the
involved constants so I now want to show
you a few examples to make this more
concrete so 3 + + 1 for example would be
contained in oo of n because we don't
care about the +1 + 3 n grows at the
same rate so it does grow at least as
fast as n the function 18 n squared
minus 50 would be contained in oo of N
squared because again and squared here
is the fastest-growing term we do not
care about the minus 50 and we don't
care about constants now very similar
here if you have two to the power of n
plus 30 n to the power of 6 + 123 that
would be in oh of 2 to the power of n we
do not care about the constant and those
2 terms here they both depend on n but 2
of n outgrows the 30 n to the power of 6
and since we add those two terms here 2
to the power of n is really just the
fastest-growing part now if we don't add
those 2 parts here but for example we
have we multiplied 2 to the power of n
times n squared we need to include that
into the O notation because just having
2 to the power of n that grows slower
than 2 to the power of n times n squared
so if we just had 2 to the power of n
here that statement would not be true
because 2 to the power of n grow slower
than 2 to the power of n times n squared
so what about a statement like 3 n plus
1 is contained in o of N squared because
N squared clearly grows at least as fast
as n so this one must also be true and
it is true the only thing is that it
would be unusual to write this because
usually we're trying to state this bound
here as tight as possible similar down
here you could also say that 18 n
squared minus 50 is contained in o of n
to the power of 3 but again this would
be unusual to write because if we have a
tighter bound that we can state
we would state this part over here so
enough with the examples I'm going to
let you figure out the rest as our next
quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
