systems in human cognition is both
powerful and straightforward in fact
production systems right from the
beginning were proposed as models of
human cognition we can look at it from
several perspectives first the working
memory in production system has a
counterpart in human cognition in the
form of short-term memory short-term
memory in human cognition at least for
the verbal part has a capacity of
approximately seven plus or minus two
elements working memory in production
systems plays a similar role second
people have connected studies in which
they have given the same problems both
to humans and to cognitive architectures
Lexor these problems typically are from
closed worlds like arithmetic algebra
and it turns out there are strong
similarities between the behavior of
programs like sore and the behavior of
humans when the address problems in
arithmetic and algebra this however does
not mean that we already have a very
good complete model of human cognition
this is just a beginning humans engage
in a very large number of problems not
just arithmetic algebra problems in
closed worlds so they still remain a
large number of questions open about how
do you build a cognitive architecture
that can capture human cognition at
large in the open</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
