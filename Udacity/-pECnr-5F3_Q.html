deep models were effective many reasons
but mostly because deep models only
really shine if you have enough data to
train them it's only in recent years
that large enough data sets have made
their way to the academic world we look
at another reason now we know better and
today how to train very very big models
using better regularization techniques
there is a general issue when you're
doing numerical optimization which I
call the ski genes problem
skinny jeans look great they fit
perfectly but they're really really hard
to get into
so most people end up wearing jeans that
are just a bit too big it's exactly the
same with deep networks a network that
just the right size for your data is
very very hard to optimize so in
practice we always train networks that
are way too big for our data and then we
try our best to prevent them from
overfitting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
