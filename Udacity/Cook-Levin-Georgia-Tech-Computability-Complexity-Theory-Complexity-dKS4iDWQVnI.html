satisfiability problem we're ready to
tackle the cook-levin theorem remember
that we have to turn any problem in NP
into an instance of sad so it's natural
to start with the thing that we know all
problems in NP have in common there's a
non-deterministic machine that decides
them in polynomial time that's the
definition after all therefore let L be
an arbitrary language in NP and let m be
a non-deterministic Turing machine that
decides L in time at most P of n where P
is a polynomial an accepting computation
or sequence of configurations for the
Machine M can be represented in a
tableau like this one here each
configuration in the sequence is
represented by a row where we have one
column for the state one column for the
head position and columns for the values
of the first P of n squares of the tape
note that no other squares can be
written to because there just isn't time
to move the head that far and only P of
n steps of course the first row must
represent the initial configuration and
the last one must be in an accepting
state in order for the overall
computation to be accepted note that
it's possible that the machine will
enter an accepting state for step p of n
but we can just stipulate that when this
happens all the rest of the rows in the
table have the same values this is like
having the accept state always
transition to itself the cook-levin
theorem then consists of arguing that
the existence of an accepting
computation is equivalent to being able
to satisfy a CNF formula that captures
all the rules for filling out this table</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
