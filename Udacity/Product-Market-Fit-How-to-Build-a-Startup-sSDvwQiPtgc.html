value propositions what we're really
trying to do is find the right product
market fit between what you're building
and who wants to buy it again we call
this relationship between value
proposition and customer segment simply
product market fit today in customer
segments in this lecture we're really
going to ask what job are we getting
done for the customer that is what
functional or social jobs are we going
to get done what emotional jobs
what problems or needs are we solving
what gains are we providing the customer
what pains
how does market type affect this and at
the end what we're going to come up with
is a deep understanding of the persona
and architect who are they why would
they buy why won't they buy what do you
need to say to them and if you spend
your energy out of the building doing
customer development and customer and
discovery here it will make your company
incredibly efficient and actually
figuring out how to market and sell to
them so remember the goal is now to
connect the value proposition with what
you're going to know and learn outside
the building about customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
