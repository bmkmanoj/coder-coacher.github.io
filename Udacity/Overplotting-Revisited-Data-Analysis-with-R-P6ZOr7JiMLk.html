anything about over plotting that's
where multiple points take on the same
value this is often due to rounding so
let's look at this by running some code
we're gonna run the table command on
both carat and price then we're gonna
sort that so that the highest values
appear first we're just gonna look at
the top six which is the default for the
head function of course what's happening
here is that the first line is the price
or the carrot and the second line is the
count for each one of these values we
can see that these are really high
numbers which is going to result in a
substantial amount of over plotting when
you have this much data you're gonna
have serious over plotting even when
you're plotting the variables against
each other and this can really obscure
some of the density and the sparsity of
our data and really key points okay so
as we discussed in Lesson four
you can deal with this by making your
points smaller by jittering your points
and by adding transparency and ggplot
this is done with the alpha parameter in
the next coding exercise you'll do just
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
