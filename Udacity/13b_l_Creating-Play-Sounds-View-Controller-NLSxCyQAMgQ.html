uiview controller for a playback seen
you had just set that generic uiview
controllers uiview to have a green
background uiviewcontroller is a great
class but we cannot add any code to it
directly in order to do audio playback
we need a UI view controller subclass
that we can add our playback code to i'm
going to show you how to create this new
class which we will call the play sounds
view controller with the pitch perfect
project open in xcode let's choose file
and then new file select source under
iOS and then cocoa touch class click
Next for the class name let's call it
play sounds view controller set it to be
a subclass of UI view controller and
make sure also create nib file is
unchecked even though it's written at
xib we still call it a nib file for old
historical purposes make sure the
language is Swift and click next here we
can just make sure that it's part of our
project and that our project is selected
as the target and click create we can
see our new place sounds view controller
that swift file in the project navigator
there is one more step the storyboard
does not know we want to use this file
for the second view controller let's
walk through changing that open the main
dot storyboard and select the second
view controller scene be sure to click
on the orange view controller circle
open the inspectors panel by clicking on
the top right button here select the
identity inspector is a third one from
the left in the drop-down for the class
let's select play sounds view controller
press return for it to take effect
that's it now storyboard knows to use
our new place sounds view controller
class instead of just a generic uiview
controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
