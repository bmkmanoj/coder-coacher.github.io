is its collection of roles as we learned
in lesson 3 and 4 a role in
accessibility term mounts to a shorthand
for a particular you I pattern are a
provides a vocabulary of patterns we can
use by the role attribute on any HTML
element when we applied role equals
checkbox in the example earlier we were
telling assistive technology that the
element should follow the checkbox
pattern we're promising that we'll have
a checked state either checked or not
checked and that the state may be
toggled using the mouse or via the
spacebar if we follow the advice in
earlier lessons we've already kept part
of that promise by implementing keyboard
behaviors in fact since the keyboard
interactions feature so prominently it's
very important to make sure that when
creating a custom widget the Royal
attribute is always applied in the same
place as the tabindex attribute so that
keyboard events will go to the right
place and so that when page focused
lands on an element its role is conveyed
accurately the Aria spec describes a
taxonomy of possible values for the role
attribute and associated Aria attributes
which may legally be used in conjunction
with those roles this is the best source
of truth when it comes to understanding
how the Aria roles and attributes all
work together and may be used in a way
that is supported by browsers and
assistive technologies it's well worth
browsing through the list of roles
linked from the instructor notes since
there's a finite vocabulary roles which
can be used and each one has specific
semantic implications also in this
screenshot we can see that certain roles
are designated as abstract these
captures certain properties which may be
common to several roles but may not be
used as values for the role attribute
the Aria spec also has a section on each
role explaining its semantic meaning as
well as any associated attributes that
may or may not be used with it let's
walk through these sections the top
section gives you the name of the role a
brief description of its semantic
meaning as well as a brief description
of the related radio group role then in
the table we start off with a superclass
rule the roles model includes a taxonomy
of roles including some abstract roles
which capture groups of roles with
common properties but can't be used on
their own
in this case the superclass roles are
option and check box so radio button
inherits properties from both of those
we also have a related concept this is
just kind of a catch-all for things that
are semantically related in this case a
radio input is related because it's a
common presentation of a radio button
these inherited states and properties
are all the properties which may or must
be applied to this element based on its
superclass rules most of these will be
optional generic global attributes but
in this case we see aria checked which
is inherited from the checkbox role is a
required attribute so if we're going to
create an aria radio button we have to
make sure aria checked is set correctly
we have some information about labels
referred to as name here name from
indicates whether the name may be taken
from the elements text content like a
button element or needs to be provided
by some other mechanism like a native
HTML radio input having contents as one
of the options here indicates that the
elements text content if it has any will
be used as its accessible label author
indicates that the author must
explicitly provide a name which will
cover a bit later in this lesson
accessible name required obviously
indicates you've got to specify some
type of name for this role this is
usually but not always true for example
the mineral indicates the main region of
a page which requires no explanation in
most cases and finally the implicit
value note here indicates the default
value for Aria checked is false this
means that if we omit the Aria checked
attribute the radio button will be
represented as being unselected it's
definitely worth learning to navigate
the Aria spec to find out about the
specifics of aria role states and
properties but if you can find a
specific pattern you want in the Aria
practices guide then that gives you all
the information you need to implement
the widget in one place it also links
back to the Aria spec for information
all the Aria attributes it mentioned
earlier we saw the one point 0 version
of this document this is the 1.1 version
which at the time i'm recording this is
a working draft i'm working of this
version in this lesson since it's more
up to date and will eventually become
the standard version this is the design
pattern we already saw for
your group which gives us the keyboard
interaction and also some more detailed
advice on the Aria attributes which
should be used the design baton tells us
that we need to put our radio buttons in
a container element with a role of radio
group give each one a role of radio and
ensure that we set Aria checked
correctly so let's try that out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
