you warm up by working on the detail
view for the shopping list I've been
working on a detail view for the
shopping list object it's in the active
list details package that I just gave to
you nothing is hooked up yet though to
actually display this screen could you
make it so that when you click on the
text of the shopping list right here it
opens up a detailed view of the shopping
list oh and the name of the shopping
list on the detail screen should exactly
match the name of the shopping list that
you click to open it this should be a
review of some of the Android code and
firebase skills that you learned in
version point one of the app and
actually one more thing so I've been
working on a new workflow for us and
basically how it's going to work is I
will describe a new feature and i'll
send you a specification document and
that document will include sort of my
thoughts of the feature and how exactly
the feature works also a couple of
implementation tips that I could think
of I've written one for the detail
screen interaction that I'm looking for
care to take a look</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
