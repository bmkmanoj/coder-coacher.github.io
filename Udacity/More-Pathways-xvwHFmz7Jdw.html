brain processes visual information
continues one of the interesting things
has been sort of separating out the
there seems to be work and in
understanding that the layout of your
visual field the geometry of your field
is different than understanding what's
in your field that is the the detection
of things and so notionally here's an
interesting little picture the idea is
that things come in in v1 and then v2
starts to go up this area this is the v3
v4 sub assignment that sort of does the
recognition this is sort of what's there
at the same time there seems to be
what's referred to as this action
pathway where v1 has a lot of
projections into this V 3 V 5 area
that's sensitive to it is sensitive to
shape but the movements of shapes and
then of course there's always
connections because this connections
everywhere in the brain but the idea is
that in the parietal lobes that's a
different structure appear is more of an
understanding of action so you have this
one pathway that's sort of the stuff
that's there and another one that has to
do with sort us how stuffs moving or
where stuff is moving there's another
whole cool area of another cool way of
investigating what goes on in the brain
if you presume that there are these
different kinds of process steps going
on different locations then you would
expect that people who have certain
types of brain injuries or birth defect
issues or whatever that certain parts of
the brain aren't working you would be
able to find selective elements of their
visual processing not functioning we
know this is true and language strokes
in different areas can cause you to lose
either semantics versus syntax so what
happens in vision well there's this very
well-known woman she has this very
interesting phenomena she cannot see
motion so like she can't cross a street
she'll look down there so see the car
there and then you know two seconds
later she'll see the car here but she
has no perception that the car is
actually moving okay so she can't
actually cross the street all right
because she
doesn't get any understanding of sort of
that space time evolution of things so
that you can think of that as an example
of there's this part that's doing this
motion and action stuff that in her
brain is just not working remember she
recognizes cars and toothpaste and all
the different kinds of things in her
world but she doesn't get a perception
of the motion in the action and this
type of thing late leads further
credence to the idea that there's a
separate pathway the separate part of
the brain that's processing this kind of
information that obviously she doesn't
have so the idea would be that you know
this action pathway shown here somehow
is not functioning as well as it should
in her in her brain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
