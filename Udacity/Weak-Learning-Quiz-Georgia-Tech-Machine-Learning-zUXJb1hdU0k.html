that you really grasp this concept of
week learning okay so here's a little
quiz that I put together to test your
knowledge so here's the here's the deal
I've got a little matrix here it's a
little table and across the top are
three different hypotheses so I paw this
is one about those two hypotheses three
so your entire hypothesis space consists
only of these three hypothesis
hypotheses got it got it okay your
entire instance space consists entirely
of only four examples X 1 X 2 X 3 and X
4 got it got it I have an X in a square
if that particular hypothesis does not
get the correct label for that
particular instance and I have a green
checkmark if that particular hypothesis
does in fact get the right label for
that example so in this case hypothesis
one gets examples 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 correct but
gets example 1 wrong while hypothesis 3
gets 1 in 4 correct but 2 &amp;amp; 3 incorrect
I see so there's no hypothesis that gets
everything right right so does that mean
that we don't have a weak learner
because then there's some distributions
for which any given hypothesis is gonna
get things wrong maybe maybe not
let's see here's what I want you to do I
want you to come up with the
distribution over the 4 different
examples such that a learning algorithm
that has to choose between one of those
three hypotheses will in fact be able to
find one that does better than chance
that is has an expected error greater
than 1/2 okay then if you can do that I
want you to see if you can find a
distribution which might not exist such
that if you have that distribution over
the 4 examples a learning algorithm that
only looked at H 1 H 2 and H 3 would not
be able to return one of them that has
an expected error greater than 1/2 so
greater than 1/2 in this case would mean
3 out of 4 correct oh no no oh you're
using you want to use that definition
that you that actually took into
consideration the distribution exactly
that's the whole point if you you always
need to have some distribution over your
examples to really
know what your expected errors alright
and if there is no such evil
distribution should I just fill in zeros
in all those boxes yes all zeros means
no such distribution you can do it in
either case so if you put in all zeros
you're saying no such distribution
exists but otherwise it should add up to
one down each of the columns it had
better add up to one all right I think I
can give that a shot okay go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
