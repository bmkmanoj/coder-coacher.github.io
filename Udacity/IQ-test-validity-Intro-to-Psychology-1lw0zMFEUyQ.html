measure intelligence or do they measure
something else such as a type of
education you received or how wealthy
your parents are in fact it's a question
of validity that's generated so much
controversy regarding IQ tests there are
different types of validity but it all
boils down to does a test measure what
it's supposed to measure and also does
it predict the outcome it's supposed to
predict now the key here is not to
overstretch what do you think an IQ test
can tell you now an IQ test does have
pretty good predictive validity in some
areas such as academic success so it's
good at telling you how good you'll do
in different academic domains but not
general life success that's right so IQ
tests are good at predicting school
achievement or even the type of college
that one gets into in fact that's why
Binet developed intelligence testing
back in the early 1900's interestingly
IQ test can predict the general type of
career one goes into whether that's law
enforcement accounting or even
construction and it's also interesting
to know that IQ is related to longevity
with people with higher IQs living
longer now when people use an IQ test to
try to tell you different important life
outcomes such as being emotionally
stable generally happy or having a
successful marriage you don't see a
relationship between IQ in these domains
so it's really important to limit what
you think an IQ test is going to tell
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
