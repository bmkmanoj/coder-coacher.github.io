cognitive ability to coordinate Piaget
and he called this stage formal
operational called a formal operational
because formal logic are making
inferences as possible for the very
first time this stage begins around age
12 goes up through adulthood and the
hallmark characteristic of formal
operational thinking is the ability to
think about abstract ideas and also the
ideal so for instance we start to wonder
about what we believe about religion
about politics and whether what our
parents told us is really beliefs that
we hold we also get into gaming and
avatars and fantasy because those things
are about the ideal and the possible
rather than the real so another
cognitive skill that we see in formal
operations is called metacognition and
metacognition is the ability to think
about your thinking to reflect on your
beliefs so for instance we see this in
hypothesis testing and scientific
reasoning and an hypothesis testing
requires that the person understand that
what they believe is tentative may or
may not be true and needs to be tested
against evidence so this is a skill that
we see in formal operational thinking so
another important point to make about
formal operational thinking is that in
contrast to the other stages of
cognitive development progression
through it is not automatic so we see
even in adults who have superstitious
beliefs for instance and these beliefs
are not tested against evidence and in
fact when you ask people for why they
believe these things like belief and
UFOs or palm reading or astrology
they'll say oh I just believed it it's
just true so just because you're an
adolescent or an adult doesn't
automatically mean you're thinking
formally or scientifically or critically
so it's not just thoughts that are
changing during adolescence it's also
your brain so and we're gonna throw you
back to Lauren who will tell you about
brain changes in adolescence</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
