could have answered this question and
what I've done is giving you four
different levels of answers that could
have fit and there are all sort of
ranked in order of being an okay answer
to really what would be the most
comprehensive and best answer based on
the material that you've been presented
with here so I want to read them to you
and see what you think and okay answer
would have just said the human genome is
made of DNA right and you just sort of
remember one you know very important
point but you know didn't say anything
else a good answer would have said that
the human genome is 23 pairs of nuclear
chromosomes right we know that they're
in the nucleus and we know that we also
have a mitochondrial chromosome and that
they're all made of DNA a better answer
would have said that we have two copies
of over three billion base pairs of DNA
and it's organized into 23 pairs of
chromosomes and we have the nuclear
genome and then we have the
mitochondrial genome the best possible
answer would have said that we've got
two copies of over three billion base
pairs of DNA so organized by histone
proteins into 23 pairs of linear
chromosomes 22 or autosomes and we have
a single pair of sex chromosomes that's
in the nuclear genome and we have one
copy from each parent and then of course
we have 17,000 base pairs from a
circular mitochondrial chromosome found
in every mitochondrion we have many per
cells so this would be the most
comprehensive or exhaustive answer ok
what I want you to do is to actually
look back at the answer your response
for this question and see how it
compares to the four you see here and
then I want you to rank your response
here on the left so if you rank right
here with this first answer I want you
to check the box that says okay if your
think you're somewhere in between these
two answers the first and the second
then you can check the box in between
them if you think yours is more similar
to the second one then click the box for
good and I want you to look at each of
these and think about where your answer
your response best fits and then check
the box that's most appropriate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
