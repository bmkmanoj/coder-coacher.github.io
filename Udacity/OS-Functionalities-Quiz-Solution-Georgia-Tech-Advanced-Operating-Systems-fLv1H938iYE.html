given you yes the operating system is a
resource manager it is the boss in
control of the hardware resources so
that's a functionality that you do
expect from the operating system yes the
operating system is the entity that
provides a consistent interface to the
hardware resource remember the earlier
lecture on abstractions I mentioned that
operating system is a level in the
abstraction hierarchy sitting between
the application and the processor and
the other resources and so in this sense
the operating system should be the
entity that provides a consistent
interface to the hardware resources such
as CPU memory and i/o devices and so yes
the second choice is a good one in terms
of functionality that you would expect
from an operating system the third
choice says the operating system
schedules applications on the CPU this
also seems like a thing that the
operating system should do because there
could be multiple applications that
require these resources and therefore
there's got to be an orbiter that is
going to provide a way of scheduling
those requests on the hardware devices
and therefore yes the operating system
is an entity that schedules applications
on top of the CPU the last choice says
the operating system stores personal
information such as credit card numbers
social security numbers and email
addresses now this looks like something
that you would not want the operating
system to do and these are these are
personal information and you would not
want the operating system to store such
information and therefore this is not a
functionality that you expect of the
operating system so the first three
choices are the right choices the
operating system is not an entity that
should be storing your personal
information such as credit card numbers
and so on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
