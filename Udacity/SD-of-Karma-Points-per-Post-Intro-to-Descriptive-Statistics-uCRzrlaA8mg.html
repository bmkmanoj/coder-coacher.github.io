longer to figure out and that's okay so
remember that the first thing we have to
do is find the deviation from the mean
for each of these values so let's do it
in cell b1 we found that the mean was
approximately twelve point nine six so
we'll write equals a1 minus twelve point
nine six and that will give us the
deviation of the first value from the
mean now we'll copy this so that we
don't have to write it in every cell and
then if you go to sell a one and push
command down at least on a Mac keyboard
and then we'll go to sell be two hundred
and then push command shift up arrow key
then you should have the whole column be
highlighted now write command V and then
you have all the deviations for each of
those values something else that you may
have done in which I taught you before
was going to this corner until you see
the plus and then dragging it down and
if you did that that's perfectly fine
these are just some keyboard shortcuts
that make our life a little easier so in
column C now let's square each of the
deviations so we'll write equals B 1
carat to which means squared and then
again will copy cell c1 go to cell b1
push command down arrow key to go to the
bottom go to sell see 200 push command
shift up arrow key so that we have all
of column C highlighted and then command
V and now we have all of our square
deviations so what's the next thing we
do we have to sum them up so let's do
that in cell D 1 equals sum of C 1 colon
c200 so we added up our squared
deviations and now this time and this is
where the sample standard deviation
differs from the population standard
deviation will divide this by n minus 1
which is 199 equals d 1 / 199 and then
our last step is to take the square root
equals s qrt of d2 so we get that RC
standard deviation is approximately four
point seven six and this is our best
estimate of the population standard
deviation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
