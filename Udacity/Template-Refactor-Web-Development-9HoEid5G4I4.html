let's just get rid of this all together
and let's see if our basic scaffolding
is working so instead of doing all that
other stuff we were doing down there
let's just say self dot render that's
the new function we just added shopping
list HTML so this should just render
that empty form and then we'll go ahead
and comment out the rest of this okay
and we'll take all this other other junk
that we were doing before and and will
comment it out for now okay let's go to
our browser and make sure this works ok
I reloaded the page and we have our ad
food thing again and if i add foods we
can see them getting added to the URL
but since we don't have any that hidden
input trick and we're not pulling things
off of parameters anymore it's just
replacing the one item in the URL but
that basically shows our template is
working end to end okay so hopefully you
were able to follow along with me
through that I know I know it's kind of
tedious but now that we have the
scaffolding up we can actually start
using these templates so let's go ahead
and learn a few things about ginger
templates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
