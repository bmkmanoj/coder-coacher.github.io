randomness in a more intelligent way but
there's one that is actually quite
common so let's assume that this year is
a huge list of all possible solutions so
so for NP complete problems or NP hard
problems this will be an exponentially
large list and the strategy of more
intelligent random algorithms and we're
soon going to see a concrete example for
that is basically to randomly pick out
certain solutions here in this list and
let's say that the lists ordered in some
way which I'm going to explain in more
detail when we get to the concrete
example and then the strategy is to
explore solutions that lie around the
ones that we randomly picked select this
so you would look at all of these
solutions here all of these solutions
something like this now of course each
time the algorithm runs here it can only
investigate a number of solutions that
is polynomial in size well of course the
list of all potential solutions so this
whole thing here has exponential size
and through the way in which you design
this algorithm well first of all you
want to ensure that you land in good
places so to say and this is often of
course not very trivial to prove how to
do that and the other thing is that you
want to have a good and intelligent
exploration of the area around your
solution against something which is
often not very easy to prove or show
actually we can't expect it to be any
other way after all we're solving a very
challenging namely and P heart or NP
complete problem here so just to prepare
you a little bit for the realities that
you are about to face let's do another
quiz let's say we have a randomized
algorithm for an np-complete problem and
that algorithm has a fixed error
probability say the algorithm makes an
error with a ninety percent chance and
only gives us the correct answer with
ten percent chance so should we expect
that a randomized algorithm for an
np-complete problem that has a fixed
error probability so say with ninety
percent chance it gives us the wrong
solution and with ten percent it gives
us the correct one should we expect such
an algorithm to run in polynomial time
and I'll give you three choices and as
always more than one can be true the
first choice i'm offering you is no
because if we would run that algorithm
just a few times we would almost be
guaranteed a
correct solution even though this
algorithm here that I'm asking you about
makes an error with a ninety percent
chance for each time that we run it or
is the answer no we should not expect
that because the number of potential
solutions is exponential and the
algorithm since it runs in polynomial
time can only and this of course
anthropomorphize is a bit can only
afford to check a small part of that
exponential solution space if you will
and finally one choice i'm offering you
is yes we should expect that because the
laws of np-completeness that we have
gotten to know in the past units do not
account for randomness so just as these
laws don't account for small basis or if
we are content with an approximate
solution it could be that randomness
makes such algorithms possible so please
check all of these here that you think
are correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
