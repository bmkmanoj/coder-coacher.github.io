assignment if I asked you to program an
online version of online slam let me run
it and compare it to the offline slam
when I run it like at vandamm landmarks
and a random initial robot pose my
offline solution gives me this long path
over here and estimated landmarks and
the remarkable thing here is that my
online version that I coded gives me the
same final pose and the same landmarks
without retaining this huge matrix for
the path before so how did I do this
here's my online slam routine in large
parts it looks exactly like my offline
Stan routine I do it in 2d I have a
measurement and motion step here's my
measurement update I have to get all
these indices right so you can stare at
them for a while
but they're all correct here there's a
plus 1 and minus 1 over here and here's
the first non-trivial thing my matrix so
far has one robot pose and one entry for
each landmark but now I'd need to add
space for the next robot pose and the
way I do this is I make an expansion
list using the expand command and this
expansion list retains the original
robot pose which has quoted zero and one
is there two dimensional poses and
indices for all the landmarks I'm
squeezing in two new rows and two new
columns for the next robot pose that's
happening in this code over here with a
squeeze then I can now do the update the
update is being applied exactly at these
two new rows and columns that I put in
and here's the math I gave you for
factorization applied to this problem
we're goin' compute the intermediate
matrices a B and C that I explained in
class and then I used the take command
to kick out the very first row and
column the first two of them to remove
the old robot pose using the exact same
logic that I gave you in class so you
can look at this this actually
