interesting history Claude Shannon was a
genius mathematician who was working at
Bell Labs who came out with this
information theory he's also called as
the father of the information age why it
is interesting is because at the time
Bell Labs had a communication mechanism
set up and they had just figured out
long distance communication but they had
no idea how to charge people so you
could send a message and they would
charge you per message or they could
find out how many words where in those
message and they could charge you per
word but none of them made sense because
you could sometimes write shorter
sentences and convey much more
information so it really became
necessary to find out what is
information and Shannon was the first
person to ever try to work on that
problem and figure something out but
information theory has also a background
from physics and that is why it has
words like entropy in it the physicists
who studied thermodynamics we're the
first scientists who actually understood
information if you are interested in
learning more about the physicists
background of information theory you
should read up on Maxwell's demon
Maxwell's demon is a very famous thought
experiment that Maxwell came out with in
physics we believe that energy can
neither be created or destroyed but
Maxwell's demon proves that energy can
be converted into information and the
combination of energy and information
can neither be created or destroyed but
let's come back to the bit world and
let's discuss how Claude Shannon looked
at it so his task was to send messages
from one place to the other and try to
figure out which message has more
information so let's start with a simple
example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
