propagation technique David why do you
think you did not see this as a 3d
object so I think there's two reasons
actually the first reason is there's a
junction right here that I just don't
have in my dictionary of junctions
involves four lines coming together at a
point but I can't deal with anything
more than three at a why constraint so
the fact that I don't see this as a
junction makes me not naturally see that
as any kind of realistic shape the other
is that if I label these three
intersections with their junctions I'll
get an l.a y and NL if i propagate the
construct from the l junction i see this
is a blade and this is the blade if i
propagate it from the Y junction I see
these are all three folds but now I have
the wide junction telling me this is a
fold and the L junction telling me that
this is a blade so I have a conflict
might attempt to propagate my
constraints down onto the shape and the
result I guess is that I don't see it as
a shape because it doesn't fit my
constraints now of course some of us do
see this as a 3d shape you can think of
this as a paper folded here one plane of
the paper and another plane of the paper
this looks kind of like an open book
this particular line here then can be
ignored it just being a line of the two
planes not signifying a surface by
itself if you view this only as a line
and not signifying a surface then that
addresses David first problem but how do
we address leave with second problem of
this being of fold or a blade depending
upon where we started constraint
propagation from the answer is that we
actually have a much more complex
ontology of disconnections the answer
lies in the fact that we have so far
used a very simple ontology just a
demonstrated constraint propagation
process in reality the ontology risk
constraints is more complicated does the
Y constraint me not just have fold fold
and fold but it might also be blade
blade and blade and the L constraint is
not always blade and blade and fold in
fold it calls to be played and fold and
fold in blade now we can see David
second problem disappearing because he y
Junction may have a plate and the L
Junction may also suggest a blade and it
is then no conflict let me know that
what we have shown here is still not a
full ontology of the YW l and t
constraints t constraints in particular
may have additional complexity the
advantage of having a more complete
ontology is that we
can use at ontology to interpret more
complex scenes like this one where there
are two rectangular objects one being
partially occluded by the other one of
course the more complicated ontology is
not without its own problems it now
introduces ambiguities of a different
kind this particular Junction is it now
a blade blade blade or is it a fold fold
fold both of them are permissible in the
new complete ontology an order results
some of these ambiguities we can come up
with additional conventions one
convention is that all of these edges at
our next to the background will consider
them to be played so you'll make this a
blade blade blade blade once you make
all these blades and it's easier to
propagate the constraints this is w
junction could have been a fold blade
fold or a blade fold blade but if we
adopt the convention of labeling all of
these lines as blades then this w
junction can only be blade fold blade
but this is a fold this y junction can
only be fold fold fold and so on and
that helps us resolve the ambiguity of
what disjunction could be this task of
image interpretation is an instance of
the abduction task an abduction we try
to come up with the best explanation for
the data this is the data we're trying
to interpret it in terms of an
explanation will discuss abduction in
more detail when we come to diagnosis
for now notice that we start with what
we know blade blade blade and it will
propagate the constraints so that we can
disambiguate between other junctions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
