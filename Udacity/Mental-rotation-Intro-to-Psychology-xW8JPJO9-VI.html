mental rotation this is the process of
imagining an object rotating in
three-dimensional space as it turns out
there's actually some gender differences
in performing mental rotation tasks
it appears that boys and men perform
better on these tasks than girls and
women do this appears to be universal
because they found similar findings in
China Japan Ecuador Ireland and in the
u.s. so how do we organize information
in our environment well we do so by
labeling and naming things we first do
this in the most basic unit of knowledge
which is called a concept the concept is
a mental group of events objects or
people so for example the concept of an
animal can include mental groups for
birds and fish and these can be broken
down even further into different types
of birds for example an eagle or sparrow
and different types of fish for example
a catfish or a koi fish these concepts
help us in our attempt to organize and
perceive the world to that end we often
engage in what's called a concept
hierarchy as you see here which is an
arrangement of concepts in a particular
way some being really general and some
being more specific
now there's two last definitions we need
to address here the first is category a
category is when multiple concepts are
organized around one concept that they
all have in common
for example vehicles or trees we can
have all the different types of vehicles
or all the different types of trees
organized around this category these are
well defined but other categories can be
kind of fuzzy such as good or
consciousness it can be difficult to
organize other concepts around one of
these two concepts and finally we have a
prototype which is the best fitting
example of a category</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
