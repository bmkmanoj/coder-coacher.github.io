done so far is to view the two goals as
if they were independent of each other
and come up with a partial plan for each
of the two goals it has not yet detected
any conflicts between them that unknown
resolve those conflicts the next thing
would be to examine the relationship
between these two plans and see if there
are any conflicts between them but how
might a partial Order plan go about
detecting conflict between two plans so
here is plan one imagine it is planned
to the partial order planner may go
about detecting conflicts but looking at
each precondition in the current plan
and if the precondition of an operator
in the current plan is clobbered by some
state in the another plan in the second
plan then the partial order planner will
know there is a conflict between them
then it can go about resolving these
conflicts but promoting or demoting one
plans goal or another plans goal this if
some state in plan B crabbers the
application of some operator and in plan
a then we may want to order the goals in
this plan and this plan in such a way
that this operator is done before that
state is achieved now let us see how the
partial order planner may go about
detecting conflict within these two
plans so the partial order planner may
begin with his plan for painting the
ladder and see whether the precondition
of this operator paint ladder a crawled
by any state in the second plan as it
turns out that doesn't happen in this
example now the partial order planner
may look at the operators in the second
plan and see whether the preconditions
of any of the operators are crabber by
some scale in this first plan so let's
look at crime ladder here the
precondition of crime ladder is on robot
floor and dry ladder and as this
precondition is compared with the states
in the first plan we can immediately see
the conflict here is dry ladder and here
it is not right either and this way the
partial order planner has been able to
find that the one of these states here
in the first plan crabbers the
precondition of one operator in this
second plan to resolve this conflict the
partial order planner may promote these
goals over the goal of painting the
ladder
some of him also notice that after the
robot has painted his ceiling the robot
is on ladder but in order to apply the
paint ladder operator the robot must be
on the floor so here there is a open
condition problem this particular
condition where this operator is not
being satisfied when the robot is on the
ladder we'll come to this in a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
