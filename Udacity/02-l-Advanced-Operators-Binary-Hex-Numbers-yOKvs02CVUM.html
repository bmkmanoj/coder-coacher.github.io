some of the more complex aspects of
operators let's start by taking a look
at some binary numbers binary numbers
are the crux of bitwise operations and
even though bitwise operators are not
commonly used they're good to know for
those special cases when you really need
them I'll show you a good example of
using bitwise operators in just a moment
here at the top of this playground vowel
I've defined the numbers 0 through 15
using binary literals notice the 0 B
prefix before each of these numbers on
the right side of the playground you can
see how these binary numbers are
represented in our normal base 10 system
below this I've defined the number 0
through 15 again but with the
hexadecimal literals their prefixed with
these 0x you can see that there and
again the numbers are represented and
based in over to the right now for each
of these constants I've declared them as
the type you and 8 and you n 8 type is
similar to the nth type except it
restricts the numbers from 0 to 255 and
we're doing this here just to keep the
numbers small what i mean by small is is
because it takes so many binary digits
to represent a big base 10 number we
want to keep those numbers really small
so that we don't have so much binary and
it just becomes really hard to look at
now you can return to this series of
constants as a good reminder of how we
can count using binary or hexadecimal
and you can see how this goes up by one
each time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
