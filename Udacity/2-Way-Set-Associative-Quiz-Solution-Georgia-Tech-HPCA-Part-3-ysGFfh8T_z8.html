set-associative cache quiz as before the
answer to this type of question requires
us to figure out which bits in the
address determine what in the cache so
the address will be broken into offset
in this case five bits index in this
case two bits to tell us which set we
have and the tag seven bits are used by
the index and the offset which means the
index will be determined only by the
least significant two digits so now we
can just figure out that zero zero zero
three is like this five bits are the
offset the next two bits are the index
so this maps to set zero and we will put
f 303 there next one is f 503 it maps to
the same set but this set now has two
places so we can actually put a 503 in
the other line in that set next we have
F 5 6 3 6 3 is like this this maps to
set number 3 and finally e F 6 3 is
going to map to the same set and we'll
put it here so as you can see with the
2-way set-associative cache we can put
more than one block that maps to the
same place in the cache and not have
conflicts this is why we want to have a
two-way cache or more because it reduces
the number of conflicts however it
complicates the tag checks because now
when we are looking for something we
have two places to search before we are
sure whether it's there or not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
