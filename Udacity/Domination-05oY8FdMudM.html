that maybe you don't want me to but I'm
going to try to do it anyway is is go
through the argument as to why policy
iteration actually works I think
ultimately it's not that bad but we're
gonna we're going to kind of slog
through it and so one of the things that
we're going to need is the ability to
compare policies to each other and value
functions to each other and so we're
going to introduce a concept of
domination oh yeah so this is what
domination means in the context of
policies we're going to say that policy
one dominates policy too if it's the
case that for all states the value of
that policy at that state for policy one
is bigger than or equal to the value of
that state for policy too so it could be
that there's some policies where policy
one does better in one state and policy
to does better in another state but if
it dominates it policy one has to do no
worse in any state and in fact we're
gonna say we have strict domination if
it's the case that policy one dominates
policy too and there's some state for
which it's actually strictly better not
equality okay and just for fun we'll
also introduce the concept of epsilon
optimal policy so policy is epsilon
optimal if it's the case that the value
function for that policy is epsilon
close to the value function for the
optimal policy at all states and so what
this does is it gives us a concept of
bounding loss or bounding regret so
we'll say that that a policy is nearly
optimal if the amount that it loses
essentially per time step is is very
small okay so by the way does this mean
that if policy one dominates policy too
but does not strictly dominate it they
must have the same value everywhere yeah
that's right they'd have to have it
would never be greater than it would
always be greater than or equal to which
means it's always equal to so two
policies that well what you said okay
good most lines is what I said</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
