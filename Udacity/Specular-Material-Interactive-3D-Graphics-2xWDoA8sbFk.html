nearly diffuse reflectors such as rough
wood newspaper concrete and mousepad
however a considerable number of
surfaces are shiny or glossy we call
these specular materials
examples include polished metals
plastics polished wood glass glazed
ceramics and enamel paint these
materials look different when you view
them from different angles so we need to
have taken to account the direction from
the surface to the eye one standard way
of simulating specular materials is
called the Blinn Phong reflection model
named after its inventors Jim Blinn and
Bui Tuong Phong the full model has a
number of terms in it for self shadowing
and for a shininess factor called the
fernell coefficient but the simplest and
most common form is this specular equals
the maximum of n H or zero whichever is
larger raised to a power and is the
surface normal same as with a diffuse
material H is called the half angle
vector say you're given a surface a
light source direction and a viewer
direction how would you point a mirror
so that the light reflected directly
toward the viewer the answer is the half
angle vector which is the vector halfway
between these two directions so that
these two angles are equal if the
surface normal and the half angle are
identical then the surface is perfectly
aligned to reflect light to the eye so n
dot H would be 1 and all light is
reflected as the normal and the half
angle diversion direction and dot H
becomes smaller
once the angle between these vectors is
90 degrees the contribution goes to zero
the maximum function here limits the
inputs so that this value is never
negative we want to avoid it being
negative because we're about to raise it
to a power the s factor here is the
shininess or specular power and has a
range of 1 to infinity the only thing
above 100 is not too much different when
you raise a fraction to a power the
result is smaller and smaller still the
higher the power for example 0.5 squared
is 0.25 cubed is 0.125 and so on by
raising this term to a higher power the
object appears shinier we can see this
in a graph of n dot H versus the
specular intensity as the cosine power
Rises this low becomes tighter and
tighter
and gets sharper what the half-angle
represents is the distribution of micro
facets on a surface a micro facet is a
way of thinking how a material reflects
light for example a fairly smooth
surface may look like this light coming
in from one direction will bounce off
the surface mostly in the reflection
direction a rougher surface with a lower
shininess has a distribution of facets
more like this and the light will still
go in the reflection direction but with
a much wider dispersal at this point
it's best for you to try out the
specular power function and see how it
responds in the example program that
follows you control the ambient diffuse
and specular contributions try playing
with the shininess and other controls to
see their effects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
