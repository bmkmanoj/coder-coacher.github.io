don't necessarily have to be turned into
charts you can keep them as reports too
but before we can turn it into a chart
we have to change the report type
because right now if you see next the
preview or set to the tabular format and
the tabular format is the simplest type
of report which is what we're looking at
right now just simple like a spreadsheet
but you can't actually turn that into a
dashboard so if we click the other
report types
so there's summary which is really
similar to tabular but it just adds a
little grouping for you to be able to
more granularly categorize the data can
I click it into me yeah okay so what do
you mean by grouping like what could I
group on so maybe one thing that we
would want to group by instead of doing
it the way we have now is if you take
that ticket type field just grab it from
the header and then drag it into where
it says drag field here and so now what
it's gonna do
yeah it separates all of the different
ticket types - these are all the ones
for VIP and then it'll give you a little
subtotal for how much has been spent
only on VIP and then the same thing for
general admission and it'll be a grand
total at the bottom okay
there is no grand total well there will
be but this is just a preview of it okay
okay so that's pretty cool that's
summary what were the other ones so the
other ones are matrix which is really
similar to summary but you can also
create groupings on the left-hand side
so that's why it's a matrix you can do
it along the top and the side and then
joined is kind of just a culmination of
a bunch of reports you can then just be
able to show different types of data in
different ways but have one huge report
okay okay so how do we how do we go from
this summary report to that our nice
little gauge dashboard
yeah so what we want to do is we want to
click us save one more time because when
you run the report it doesn't actually
save it okay after it saves click run
report okay so here's a report and we've
got our VIP ticket type total spent for
each person no I would have liked this
sum total down here yeah I totally
forgot the last step so let's go back
into the report editor by just clicking
customize here and it'll take us right
back to the viewer in before so what we
care about is the total spent column
right
so let's actually drag that to the end
just so kind of keeps that separate we
can see the total on the right okay and
then click that little arrow and then
what we're gonna want to do is we're
gonna want to summarize this feels ok
and then click some so it'll create a
total for each of those yeah and now we
can see it's gonna sum up all of the
VIPs all of the general missions and
we'll have a grand total at the bottom
ok so I'm going to save and run the
report again yes all right we've got
about fourteen thousand six hundred
bucks spent on VIP tickets and in twenty
eight thousand or so in the general
admission nice okay that's cool so now
if I go to the bottom okay a keep track
of the total amount and I'm guessing
this is I mean I know this is the number
that somehow has to feed into our little
our gauge thing exactly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
