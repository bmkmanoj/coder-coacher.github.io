8 if so that is awesome now what makes
this problem easier than the last one
well first the slope is given so we
don't have to calculate the slope the
other is if we look at the point 0 to
the point 0 2 is actually the
y-intercept because x is 0 and Y is 2
now if we know the slope and we know the
y intercept we can very easily use slope
intercept form and write y equals MX
plus B which equals three fourths times
X plus 2 which is the y-intercept since
we want to write the equation in
standard form I'm going to go ahead and
multiply the equation through by for
giving me for y equals 3x plus 8 and if
i want to write this in standard form i
need to move the 3x over to the other
side which would give me negative 3x
plus 4y equals 8 now you might be asking
why is this answer different from this
answer well they're actually the same if
I were to take this equation and
multiply the whole equation through by
negative 1 i'm going to get negative 1
times negative three x gives me 3x
negative 1 times positive 4y gives me
negative 4y and negative 1 times
positive 8 gives me negative 8 so as you
can see this equation negative 3x plus
4y equals 8 is the same as the equation
3x minus 4y equals negative 8 a
convention we typically use in math is
that we do not have a negative
coefficient to our X variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
