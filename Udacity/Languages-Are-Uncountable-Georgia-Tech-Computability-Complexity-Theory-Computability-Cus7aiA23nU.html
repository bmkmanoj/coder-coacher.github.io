one that does well no as it turns out
the set of languages is uncountable will
prove this pack contradiction so suppose
not
that is to say we'll let l1 l2 be the
set of languages over an alphabet Sigma
here I'm giving them in an enumeration
and we'll also let x1 x2 etc be the
strings in Sigma star we know that has
an enumeration we are then going to
build a table where the columns
correspond to the strings in Sigma star
and the rows correspond to the languages
in each element in the table we'll put a
1 if the string is in the language and
we'll put a 0 if it is not now we're
going to consider a very sneaky language
defined as follows
it consists of those strings X I for
which X I is not in the language L I in
effect we've taken this diagonal here in
the table and just reversed since we're
assuming that the set of languages is
countable this language must be LK for
some K but is X K in L K or not you see
from the table here we've defined the
row L K such that in every column the
entry is just the opposite of what is on
the diagonal but this diagonal entry
can't be the opposite of itself if X K
is in L K then according to the rules
for L K it should not be an okay on the
other hand if X K is not in L K and it
should be in L K another way to think
about this argument is to say that this
language here must be different from
every row in the table because it is
different on the diagonal element in any
case we have a contradiction and can't
conclude that this enumeration of the
languages was invalid since the rest of
our reasoning was sound this argument
here is known as the diagonalization
trick and we'll see it come up again
later when we discuss undecidability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
