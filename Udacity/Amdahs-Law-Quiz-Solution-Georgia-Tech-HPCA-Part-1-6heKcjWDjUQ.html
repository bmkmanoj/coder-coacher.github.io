Andals law quiz
the program has 50 billion instructions
this is how many instructions according
to the instruction count are integer 40
% branches are one fifth of our
instructions stores are 10% and so on
and this is the original CPI and the
improvement we have is that the branches
have improved from 4 to 2 CPI if we try
to use on those law we might do
something like this this overall
speed-up is 1 over 1 minus fraction
enhanced the fraction enhanced is 20% so
it will be zero point 8 is the one minus
that plus 0.2 is the fraction enhanced
divided by the speed-up is 2 so this
would be 1 over 0.9 which would be 1
point 1 1 1 and if you did this you will
be horribly horribly wrong the reason
this is wrong is that the fraction
enhanced is not as a percentage of the
overall execution time before the
improvement we said this is how many
instructions are enhanced so branches
are 20% of the instruction count but we
don't know what percentage of execution
time was spent on branches and execution
time is what we are interested here so
that one of the possible correct
solutions here is simply to do the
following using the iron law we can
compute that for 40% of our instructions
we were getting a CPI of 1 for 20% of
the instructions we are getting a CPI of
4 for 30% of the instructions we're
getting a CP of 2 and for 10% of our
instructions we were getting a CPI of 3
multiply that by our 50-billion and
multiply that by 1 over 2 billion which
is the two guards so this would be the
execution time before the enhancement
after the enhancement we will be having
the same thing except there would be a 2
here and if you do that the answer will
be 1 point 24 in order to be able to use
undos law what we have to figure out is
of this execution time what fraction
were the branches and if we did that we
would be able to plug that number here
and here as the fraction enhanced and
get the correct answer here so again do
not use something other than the
fraction of execution time as your
fraction enhanced because you will not
get the correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
