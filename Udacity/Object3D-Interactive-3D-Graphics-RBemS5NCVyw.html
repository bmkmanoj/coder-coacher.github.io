position and then rotate the hand of a
clock in place the problem is that 3GS
rotates then positions when we like to
do these in the opposite order one
simple solution that 3j s provides us to
use object 3d to make a new object that
contains our clock hand here's the code
for how to do this what is happening
here is that the block is nested inside
the clock hand object the translation
moves the block so that one end is over
the center of the clock face so that the
hand will rotate around the clock
properly by putting this object into the
clock hand I'm saying that I want to use
the block in its current position I can
then apply an additional scale rotate
and translate in this case I just want
to rotate the final line of code adds
the clock hand object to the scene
that's one way to look at object 3d it
adds more transforms into the list that
you can then use we now have some six
transforms that we could set in this
system here's the conceptual diagram of
the whole idea we create a block and we
can scale rotate and translate that
block then by putting it inside an
object 3d called the clock hand we get
an additional scale rotate and translate
that we can apply here's a more compact
way to write out the order of transforms
the object gets scaled rotated and
translated and then scaled rotated and
translated again this looks a bit crazy
I've put the order of the transforms
from right to left there's a reason for
this and we'll talk about it when we get
to matrices for now just believe me that
this is how most computer graphics texts
show a series of transforms the way I
remember this order is by the word trash
there's TRS in that word in the proper
notational order I guess I could use the
word trees instead and not have to think
about the H but I like trash as it
reminds me of the trs-80 called a trash
ad for short one of the first personal
computers from back when programs were
stored on cassette tapes once upon a
time this computer ruled the earth in
1979 it had the largest selection of
software for any PC TRS then is the
order to remember in our case just the
boxes translation and the clock hands
rotation are used this gets us the
combination we want translate so that
there's a new origin
and then rotate around this origin
adding a whole object 3d to get a single
additional transform seems like overkill
but really it doesn't add much code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
