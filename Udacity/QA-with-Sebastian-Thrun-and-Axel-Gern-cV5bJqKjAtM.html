introduce sebastian thrun founder of
Udacity and one of the inventors of a
self-driving car as well as axel gern
from mercedes-benz between the two of
these guys so between the two of them
they have either invented manufactured
or hired a lot of people in this area
the way the whole format will go is
Sebastien will talk and ask a few
questions then we have mics in the aisle
please feel free to line up and ask any
questions you have off them enjoy it's
so great seeing all of you what a dream
come true I hope all of you will become
works last after Inka engineers
my role here is to basically introduce
and ask questions of axel who runs the
mysterious self-driving car team so I am
the moderator and he's the smart person
with all the answers as you know my
feeling is one of our founding hiring
partners but also a really important
player in the development of content for
us and has helped us to we put together
a very nice curriculum and seem very
very grateful for this they are also one
of the best employers in Silicon Valley
so if you ever want to find a job it's
it's a phenomenal place to work I can
tell you it's a very happy place to work
very nice perks and so on and you might
get picked up in the morning by
self-driving car who knows so Excel
welcome I think I'm going to ask you a
few questions about this
can I ask tough questions you can try
but probably I'm asking backgrounds so
when you work for a car company most of
the people that I talk to in this field
work for places like Google or Baidu or
DD when you go back to Germany and talk
to the CEO or the leadership of the
company how do they look when you say
I'm making progress
yes yeah okay and probably and to say
one thing typically you will Treaty
there's a traditional car company we can
metal and steel and all these kind of
things but which you are
some sense I think we're doing a pretty
good job in that part and but we have
seen that we have transformed ourselves
to also a software company I think
you've been the number one company in
terms of self-driving cars in the
automotive space by a long time actually
you've done this when I was a high
school student that's true so we have a
long history not an almost driving I
mean we had for example a car driving
autonomously on a highway and making
autonomous lane changes and so on
in 1995 yes already on the right so
therefore we have a long history in that
and we have brought already some of the
stuff to production so you can have this
topic overseas you have a highway pilot
system and so on yeah right but this is
vision that I'm over and DeeDee and
Google and others have kind of
proclaimed we're you don't own your car
anymore but instead when you need a car
it comes to you you get it with your
phone and it drops you off and if I did
my math correctly I don't think we need
quite as many cars and the bad vision
then the owner vision that's the
question really them asking yeah so yeah
it's a good question I mean there are
several surveys out there statistics and
so on you can yeah you can look at them
some saying we're getting half of the
cars and we're saying we're staying the
same number because mobility is getting
cheap so we're getting more cars and
then you have to discuss whether we get
less traffic jams in the inner city
traffic or even more that's basically
the question I think we will see what
the future brings us there nevertheless
I think we have to be prepared of that
and you see that in typical tense in
city traffic the number of cars owned by
the customer will be reduced and we have
you see the success of uber right now
and so on that will change definitely
but if you look if you're going out to
Lake Tahoe or so I'm not sure whether we
have the mobility services they're
available for everybody and that we can
provide some kind of mobility service
for everybody there so therefore it will
some kind of balance I think
nevertheless just one more sentence
have to be prepared on that so what my
our CEO dr. Satcher also said is yes we
have to transform ourselves from pure
car manufacture to mobility service
company information has a huge
transformation it's great I mean if I
say this has been so amazing in
literally being the first not just in
Germany and the world to take south or
in car seriously and we worked with
University Bundeswehr in Germany at some
point and and had some video diseases
what's your timeline for these products
in the marketplace I mean we have to
distinguish two things so one thing is
we have we will have autonomous driving
systems for we are selling to customers
first introduction will be some kind of
a highway pilot system my big boss like
I'm not telling a secret my big boss
said the end of the century okay
universe sorry end of the decade sorry
otherwise I would be my god Oh even more
okay I think I'm still working then so
end of the decade and very soon and bath
that is the one side of the story the
other thing we discussed before is the
having the system's mobility services
for inner city traffic I think that
takes some years longer okay get it at
least at a level of robustness and so on
that we can yeah deploy it
but the one thing is the nice thing
about this is that you can do things
like geofencing or you do not deploy it
when it's rainy or snowing and so on you
do not offer that service during that
time on the other side if you would have
a car on the road driving autonomously
you sell to a customer he's it's bad
when it's only working in a certain
situation and all the time and so on so
are the different levels where you can
play around with in terms of scenarios
you're driving or weather conditions and
interesting are you hiring right now
engineers yes yeah what is what it was
desperate to find right now what type
skillset I mean in general we are a
global acting company so we are hiring
at least worldwide in general for
autonomous driving we're focusing on the
Silicon Valley here and we have several
departments in Germany working on it in
the suit Cod area so if you like Germany
and south of it it's also an opportunity
here in the Silicon Valley we basically
we distributed the work between the
German colleagues and us so we have all
the sense of stuff done in Germany all
the vehicle integration actuators and so
on and we are here focusing on things
like sensor fusion localization
prediction maneuver planning and so on
you got the intelligence stuff and the
Germans get the dull and boring stuff
that is my I wouldn't say so because if
you look for example at the camera
system what's going on there I mean we
have seen the videos before that's
amazing what's going on with deep
learning there and there is a whole new
world actually it's not just so the
Germans may integrate the camera into
the car and you make it smart no that's
very cool yeah so in any piece of advice
you might have for a thirsty set of
amazing students to to get into the
field mistakes to avoid no I think you
have to make mistakes so that's
important in the end so you have to to
work hard on the stuff think about it
make your mistakes but learn from that
so that's basically the important thing
it's crazy we have a microphone for
questions from the audience but using
with much more interest in my questions
so there's a hand up there and hand up
here if you could somehow pass those
around
I'll line up behind the microphones I
see there's two microphones one over
there what are there hi well people
people are gathering here in your
microphone I'll ask the question so you
had a card 20 years ago that was capable
of driving itself it's a type of system
but still it's a lot it's a technology
that you had before and people were
thinking autonomous driving cars in
1950s
why now so why water is we have today or
what what's changed since then so that
now it's gonna happen or is it gonna
happen actually lots of things have
changed so the dealing with big data for
example is a huge change you have the
computation power in the car when I
worked on my first camera system I had
this little computer it has the ability
of a calculator also you have to count
every single bit in there and that is
one of the major changes you see right
now that is it will be available in the
car in production huge computational
power memory and some sensors have
forgotten much better obviously I mean
when I was a grad student digital
cameras were super expensive and
extremely repaired they first work by
documents was barely able to find cars
usually on the black bar and I need the
car and the use of what's called
transputer system which was like
high-end multiprocessor many hundreds of
thousand dollars of computers they fit
into a truck a trunk that's all part of
it and then our ability to store data as
exercise and do data processing it's
fundamentally transformed yeah yeah
thank you both for being here when I was
in middle school I remember reading an
article about self-driving cars in a
special lane on the highway where they
could communicate in a networked fashion
and drive all at the same speed you know
much faster than we could our selves and
I think we can get very far with sort of
individual agents the self-driving cars
you know acting in their own best
interest but and maybe this is a
question the scope is that you know the
end of the century
what are the limitations for cars that
self-driving cars that communicate
together
what can we achieve with networks of
cars as opposed to individual agents and
and what do you think the scope in terms
of the time span is for for those
problems I I mean you can you can make
things much much better if you can
communicate with each other that's clear
the problem is you will still have to
cope with mixed traffic so probably if
you have an old old timer a nice old car
you wanted you do not want to give that
away and that is the least car that will
go away at least so you cannot say ok
sell your old Porsche II or whatsoever
Corvette just because you're not allowed
to drive it anymore so you have to deal
with mixed traffic that means you have
to cope with all the situations without
communication - yeah and me if you look
at this the spectrum if you can
communicate you can be to block creative
but what you build for example you could
have a truck driver that drives a truck
manually and three other trucks Lenna
behind it in a following the first truck
right which means now we can drive this
convoy around the clock to be a huge
impact on the trucking industry if you
could just do that okay and still you
have a human driver in charge so you
make a train is a there's projects in
the US military projects in Europe
pursue this I I mean I did the Google
stuff I never want to do this because I
was wanted to make the first car useful
right so the first customer happy and
then the second customer happy in the
chain first two customers are driving
together at zero so this is a
chicken-egg problem that's been in the
air for quite a while and it's gonna be
staying with us for why because
customers won't pay for the added
benefit of heavy communication unless
there's a benefit question yeah what is
the single biggest challenge to getting
a self-driving car by the end of the
decade is it
infrastructure is it you know if if you
guys all work out then technology is not
among them
there's certainly I mean as different
business model says the the owner
operated business model way oh yeah I'm
still have a leg up and you're subject
to the manufacturing and testing cycles
and release cycles of volumes it truly
takes about seven years to build a car
roughly plus plus or minus and then
there's the somewhat more aggressive
business model of the ubers and it is in
the world they wanna make simulations
more as a service and they've aim in
this direction their technologies to the
big issue because you can't drive a
hundred percent reliable yet and even
ninety nine percent is not good enough
when I never nine nine percent is not
good enough but I would say I mean if
you look at Google as an example which
is still a leading city driving at this
point if the large is almost there it's
still expensive
there's still an issue about center
costs so Google car is way too expensive
compared to what it should cost so one
of the pushes here is to go away from
very expensive laser equipment and to
camera equipment but the things are
coming together honestly I mean I see
them I mean I'm an optimist I think
we're gonna see pilots in the space for
public views long before the decade is
over I would add one thing is the
validation so how to make sure that you
at least reach the same level as a human
driver or the expectations to better get
even better at least thank you guys for
organizing this so there's obviously a
lot of hype surrounding autonomous cars
I'm curious what you guys think are some
industries that will benefit from from
self-driving car technology that are
perhaps a little bit less obvious so
things like autonomous equipment in
agriculture or BOTS and warehouses what
are some less obvious application set
where you guys think there's lots of
opportunity self-driving car engineers
the benefit
I mean in the warehouse is unlikely
cultural industry it so you can already
see that that change I would say the
real estate industry will benefit
because now we are going to live further
outside if you can sleep during your
commute then even into the foot outside
so if you want to be a good speculator
by land at the outskirt of big cities
it's cheap and you can create nice areas
with trees and so on instead of building
ya parking garages the parking crash
industry will not be happy
the tort lawyers will not be happy the
trauma surgeons will not be happy the
insurance company not be happy we see
we're very unhappy indeed a confluent -
so most insurance company most proper
insurance and I know it's a it's a
consumer product but if you make a day
if a company like like Diddy owns the
cars or uber or lyft then it becomes a
insurance for company and in the margins
we go down massively we're on looking
into the future you can imagine that
most people are honest they drive you
know follow the rules and stuff but
let's assume there's some bad guys out
there who want to steal a car so you
could imagine they could put four people
in around the car the car would be stuck
because you realize that the objects
around them there's no way to turn going
back so how would you ambition to solve
or anticipate that problem oh I love the
creativity all students it's amazing
what a great project yeah there's
actually lots of Google self-driving
cars here just do it it's taking this
more into serious territory it's been a
very broad discussion about
cybersecurity for cars and there's been
some data research left UCLA and others
who've shown that you can actually hack
into existing cars and with very my
tricks like make the brake not
functional and and take away braking
powers
power it's actually even worse if you're
not just remotely hack into a car but if
you are repairmen next to your car by
the cars been serviced it seems almost
impossible to protect the car from the
kind of breach so as we develop I think
there's going to be a an increasing
interest in in cybersecurity for those
cars the last thing you want is at some
foreign country and then specific day
makes all the cars turn left and there
could be verses today by 11 but it
doesn't solve your problem I think you
can steal it I have a question for
Sebastian so choosing this sour driving
car this is only for big company where
they have a lot of resources and big
data so what did the opportunity for
start-up what a potential idea for
start-up where they don't have lot of
resources to buy a lot of car I what a
what a potentially paying that the
static can do besides selling a thousand
all the device and get ban book a banned
by the National Highway
boy it's a phenomenally great question
and there's one I also puzzled about
because many of my students want to
start companies and have like Dukes for
example or auto or others right now the
hottest thing is of course building up
teams that can do this because of such a
shortage of competent teams and the most
recent acquisitions in this space for
all talent acquisitions for engineering
talent which I think this is a tiny
thing to do self in cars what you guys
are doing yet cos this ecosystem unfolds
there be new kinds of services that
don't exist today for example fleet
management of a company change in South
Africa range the way you prepare them
and service them will change I would
argue data services there will probably
an aft ak-47 cars at some point who
acquires Street data and those companies
might use different models for data
acquisition so enough tech has its own
fleet of vehicles it drives around and
gets map data but the future might end
linked to cell phones and use cell phone
data as a way to keep your map data up
to date
just have a bit google maps and then I
don't know what what's beyond there's
maybe maybe there's cleaning services
there can be different from the past
because after in cars now have to be
clean differently because no one's going
to clean them and so on and so on
they'll be monitoring services for
people that users have different cars a
taxi to behave well and so on we'll see
I mean there'll be a ecosystem my
warning for people building companies
timing is of course of essence right so
if you for example build a company that
has this hypothetical I've seen for some
companies building for drone spaces
building the the middleware for
management but no one quite makes money
with drones yet then timing might be too
early and you might want to have cash
give us five more years I mean in
general it's a huge invest into that
field and you have to have that and it
takes a long time until you get a rich
one yeah that is pretty difficult I mean
I have a hunch that many of the server
and card companies the service Commons
we build is electric as a propulsion and
actually electric is in many ways nicer
for self-driving cars and is for
owner/operator cars because if you
really run out of your tune of my range
or fifty mile range you can just fish
the car and take a different car and the
service model wears in an owner
operating model it's harder
so maybe businesses will spin up around
the idea of installing electric charges
in your private home and make your
driveway that's not not use anymore
it charged my frame I'm kind of coming
up with random ideas here but to believe
anything's happened there's many new
businesses that form okay so
Udacity decided to use a fourth car
instead of Mercedes to start this and
I'm not gonna ask what I couldn't afford
when they great cars may take yeah so if
I ever become a self-driving car
engineer and I kind of for a Mercedes
which is the model that I should buy to
fix that problem to actually put your
software well I downloaded open pilot
and I'm making it work with my Ford
Fusion but if I was gonna do the same
thing with a Mercedes I don't know which
model to target which ones easiest for
hack
good good question
so thank you I mean you have an electric
power steering in every car we have a
brake assist in every car so tippy
actually you can the cheapest please
that is basically the CLA or so
nevertheless I mean we do not allow that
for security reasons and we talked about
the security stuff before so that's why
we do not allow that so you need to
develop some kind of vehicle interface
module for you that you can run your
software on it
yes so yeah if you if you happen to hack
a Mercedes
we are open sourcing the software you
will never ever get Mercedes enforcement
it would be crazy when we chose Toyota's
back in the day to it I had no clue
about it and they happen to be the
easiest to him he could just cut the
wires and they had no boat security so
you could just have a scope running and
figure out what the signals were and in
the fourth case is very similar right
now that's very used to Ford I can I can
tell you our team would love the cinema
sales every day Amy it's gonna have
maybe some other serious hears about
this and gives us a mysterious gentleman
before me just ask exactly the question
I wanted to ask gonna okay burden that a
question for Sebastian if you can
comment which mapping company did you
buy maps from for Udacity and do you see
mapping as a valid business model to
build a start upon which become did that
by map injuries i mapping like somebody
from Udacity mentioned that so I I'm not
sure we didn't I didn't buy anything up
let's see I worked at Google and before
the gue legs I went a protocol GT very
built into digital map set for the world
so every time we pull the phone and he's
grew in apps we did that data and there
was a competitor to enough take until at
last the two duopolists at the time and
in empower Google to run terma turn
directions and phones which was new by
Android at the time
I think there's there is valid business
models for mapping in there and it's
anyone's guess who's gonna win this
mapping game and the reason is just
economically every car company building
an old map set it's just not very
economical it's much smarter for car
companies to license from somebody else
so so it's something else but end up
being able to do this across many many
car companies and as a result offer
these services cheaper I don't know I
mean how close car companies I use
licensing self-driving today that my
feeling is not not that close yet
because the data formers are still being
studied right yeah but no I mean as one
step in that game strategically we
acquired here which formerly was enough
tech together with BMW and an Ori
to get into that field and to basically
get the maps we need for also for safe
driving cars yeah tell me what happens
in space is actually funny that the the
well-established companies are often
outmaneuvered by the small companies and
the reason is develop service companies
have very selfish personnel and way of
doing things like in mapping you can get
a PhD called geo information systems and
they have ways of doing this and when we
looked at Google and wonder bit on maps
we realized that the processes are
really archaic so we fired all the DS
people on our team and when two computer
scientists in it a much better job as a
result the same happens in many many
cases I mean I think that in the
self-driving car space I think small
teams have a real chance to make
significant progress and we should you
should try in and being acquired by
companies like Mercedes or Google quick
question for axel I've been a huge fan
of car2go
which is a Mercedes owned car sharing
car rental service I haven't seen much
developed on that and BMW seems to be
stepping up with reach now and it just
went to Portland it was amazing
experience I'm wondering if you're doing
anything with car to go and this seems
like a great way to deploy vehicles as
way as well plus I'd love to drive a
Mercedes in Bay Area without owning one
so
every every time I see Marsalis is
standing in the dealership's it hurts me
because like people can be driving them
just requesting by the phone and
nobody's doing that I mean two things
first of all yes we are introducing also
Mercedes cars so two car will go right
now as far as I know I'm not in the
business nevertheless you can change the
business model for this car sharing
dramatically when you have self-driving
cars because you can bring the cars to
the customer and you reduce to be with
them and so on and that's actually one
of the use cases we're working on how to
drive a Mercedes without owning one I
can think of a couple of ways none of
them illegal we can expect fully
autonomous cars at the end of a decade
or so currently we have a lot of
autonomous functions in the cars such as
parallel parking emergency braking
cruise control what is Mercedes
currently working on for autonomous
functions because we can do a lot of
autonomous things for a car that aren't
fully autonomous know what's coming up
in the next couple of years exactly that
when you're talking about the SAE an ohm
clade sure we have currently level two
automation which is I don't know how you
call it partially in a combined
automation so you combine it to some
kind of lane keeping and distance
control and so on but nevertheless the
driver has to take over responsibility
at short notice and that is a key to
change when you're coming from level two
to level three that you allow the driver
to do different things while driving
saying reading emails and they had unit
or whatsoever so you cannot hand over
responsibility at short notice within a
second or so you you have to allow the
driver to understand the traffic
situation and enact accordingly and that
is level three automation at least so in
the step is from level two to level
three okay so that means even in case of
failure
the little must be able to cope with the
situation for a certain amount of time
and that means if you break it down you
need redundant systems and so on so the
five levels are worldwide because I know
NASA national highway safety they issued
a document on the five yeah yeah there's
a lot of confusion there was from a
German version there is a the Nitsa
version they say II but I think it all
breaks down now to the knee to the SAE
and also the mid-size adopting that so
and typically for the a set for the cars
we are selling to customers we're going
from level two to level three years yes
next set okay and thank you for coming
here to see us so thank you for doing
this so I had two part question so one
was come June when I finished my course
I'm going to hack my Prius so it would
be good if you open-source what you did
on Prius or on cord because that's not
available that could be really useful
and and the second one was Tesla is
talking about all cars are going to come
with the hardware in it obviously I
don't have one but is mercedes planning
on any models which will actually have
the hardware built in and come 2018 you
will start pushing in software in it or
something like that
I mean over-the-air update is a big
thing and yeah we are working on that
definitely to get also over-the-air
updates I think we have time for one
final question before Shahnaz cuts us
off so please over here and apologize
for those who can can ask thank you
I was hoping to get your thoughts on the
ethical implications involved in
creating a collision avoidance system
for instance a hypothetical where a car
could either hit a pedestrian but save
the lives of the occupants or hit a wall
and save the pedestrian but kill the
occupants on that's one ethical issue
that's been kind of thrown around on the
internet the past few years and I was
hoping to get your take on it
no it's a it's a very serious question
it's a it's a great question actually we
do not have a solution yet actually I
mean would you buy a car that will kill
you in case of such an emergency I don't
know so but probably it's from a society
point of view the best solution right
and I mean everybody is talking about
the trolley problem that is a very very
rare case at least so but I think on the
other we are working on that and it's a
difference between a human driver coming
to that situation
he's just able to react in a split of a
second right and on the other side you
have the developer of such a system
who's sitting in front of this monitor
or thinking about it from for hours how
to solve it
so so we have to give them the tools in
the hand to come to a solution and
that's why we're working together and we
have to come to a a general solution to
that problem it's not I think it's not
the right approach to say okay we have
this mercy this code of ethics and the
BMW is doing it differently to your eyes
doing it differently so it's a it's a
global discussion we have to go yeah I
mean I've been asked this question so
many times for journalists and I'm
somewhat tired of it and when my best
answer is the cars gonna pick one of the
choices and it doesn't really matter and
the reason why I think this is because
we have 1.2 million traffic deaths every
year in the world and suppose we build a
car that would get rid of two-thirds of
those deaths and we're going down to
three and a thousand three deaths I
think it'd be phenomenally great
ethically to do this okay and I don't
want to stop that progress because
there's a philosophical question about
this extremely rare case where someone
could kind of even take a position but
the right answer is if you can't take a
position where the right answer is and
let's pull over at answer or maybe both

difficult yeah put it please give us an
answer guys and move on well I want to
