directory but surely there's more to
this computer than just that right oh
yeah there is a lot more so let's start
exploring some of the other areas of the
Linux operating system will do this by
seating to the top level root folder
with CD / if we LS dash al this
directory will see that there's a lot of
content here we're definitely not going
to cover all of these but we'll discuss
the most important folders we're already
familiar with home but there are two
other important directories where you'll
be making lots of changes and editing
files et Cie is where configuration
files live as we start setting up our
web and database server will be
modifying some files within this
directory waar is for variable files
which is kind of an odd name variable
files are simply files that you expect
to grow or change in size over time
you'll typically find system and
application logs within this directory
there are a few other directories that
are important for you to know but you
probably won't be modifying or directly
interacting with them bin is where
executable binaries are stored that are
accessible by all users these are
applications you run like the LS command
we've used a few times already if you
were to list the contents of this
directory you would actually see there's
a file called LS within it s bin is very
similar to bin except that these
binaries are to only be used by the root
user for system administration and
maintenance purposes we'll discuss some
of the applications within this
directory a bit later Lib is for
libraries that support the binaries that
are located around the system finally us
r is for user programs this could seem
to be confusing compared to the bin
directory the difference isn't that
important the only difference really is
that the binaries within bin are
required for boot up and system
maintenance processes and the binaries
in u.s. are necessarily aren't required
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
