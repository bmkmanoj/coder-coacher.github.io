months old he said ba for water well why
is that well he learned bottle of water
and so he said Bob now he would even
extend this to anything water so for
instance a lake or a pool or a bathtub
now my wife and I of course knew this we
had to translate though for his
babysitter's or other people because he
developed his own unique way of saying
things which is pretty common when
children are first learning language so
in fact perhaps you have examples of a
sibling or a cousin who's at the similar
age right now and says things their own
way so why don't you go to the forum and
talk about this maybe give some examples
that you know about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
