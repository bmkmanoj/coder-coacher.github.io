search algorithm you have some kind of
list and you're just checking out each
element however in a sorting algorithm
you're changing the order of elements in
an array let's say you wanted to sort
these guys by height you have some
decisions to make first should I put the
shortest element on this end or on this
end and what algorithm should I use to
sort you could just compare every
element to every other element until you
have everything in order this is called
the naive approach since there's no real
trick or cool algorithm involved there
the naive approach is normally the first
thing your mind skips to when you see a
new problem it makes you think I know I
could do it this way and everything's
going to be right but there's probably a
smarter way to do this sorting is kind
of a weird topic you'll rarely be given
a problem that can't be solved with one
of the classic sorting algorithms we go
through here as far as interviews are
concerned it's important to understand
how sorting algorithms work and have
their runtimes memorized so you can
answer complexity problems really fast
lastly you should make sure you've
considered whether your sorting
algorithm is in place or not an in-place
sorting algorithm just rearranges the
elements in the data structure they're
already in without needing to copy
everything to a new data structure these
algorithms have low space complexity
because you don't need to recreate the
data structure often you'll have that
classic trade-off when you use less
space or use less time it doesn't really
matter for arrays with ten numbers but
if you have millions or billions of data
points it makes a huge difference it'll
never hurt to mention that in an
interview you can pick one way over the
other but say while you're doing so the
more reasons you can provide for your
choices the smarter you seem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
