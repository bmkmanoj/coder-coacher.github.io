that in case this code did not work for
you ask us questions on the discussion
forum we are here to help now you may be
curious about this file called fresh
tomatoes so let's talk about it next now
I want you to recall that this file
fresh tomatoes dot pie had a function
inside it called open movies page now
this function receives a list of movies
and then creates and opens an HTML file
out of that page that showcases those
movies by the way it stores this HTML
file in the exact same folder as all of
your other movie Program Files so let me
go to that folder now and here is my
movies folder with all of my Python
movie files right here notice that this
is the HTML file that we just created by
running our program this is the file
that actually showed us all of our
movies and played the trailer and here
is the fresh tomatoes Python file that
you downloaded from our website let me
open it alright here is the code for our
Python file fresh tomatoes py now while
I won't go through this entire code in
detail I encourage you to read through
this program I want you to understand
how it takes in a list of movies and
creates a website to show those movies
now we've added comments to this file
that will make this code readable all
right the next thing we want to do is we
want you to share the movie website that
you've created thus far so here is your
task we want you to create your very own
movie website with your favorite movies
once you've done that we want you to
share any one of the following two
things with us on the forum you can take
a screenshot or an image of your movie
website and share that with us on the
forum or if you have access to a
smartphone we want you to record and
share a YouTube video of you showing
your movie website to a friend once
you've submitted your responses on the
forum make sure to check this box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
