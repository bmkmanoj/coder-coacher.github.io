peach activism I project we were told
how to make the map here essentially you
have to add this line to your resume to
resume dr. yes and load up to us and
file to make the residential and you
also have to come into a bunch of lives
in your help
GS so essentially all the lines here you
have to implement that those lines and
you know if you do this that the map on
the reservation up the magic or not
we're going to talk a little bit about
how how this actually happens on how
what the code is showing your resident
was is like an essential most of the
code is in the helper is the following
along it
um and there's one thing from channel
that sort of makes everything happen
makes all this happened called
initialize map and this function is
essentially cold when when your peach
loads initially map initialize max
called isn't really want to incoming
this go to overhear this is exactly what
happens like what's called it and in
fact i have actually been commented in
here so you can see you know here are
initialized map is is called download
the other side over here i have the
lines that you had one comment briefly
what happens when this when like this
watching this cold is that your script
collect all the locations from the
objects and having resume so this
happens in a helper function that's what
location finder and essentially what
this function does is it loops over your
work and your places where you were
working in education in nearby object i
need collect all the location data from
from those object and then it uses a
google play services to translate those
three addresses into feeling like you
and then places that as pins on the map
so we can just go
upwards to this function because we
really inside this function inside
Michelle's Mac that's where everything
happens and so essentially we define
several helper functions inside this
function and then call them in order to
collect information and to presented as
depends on the map
so first the first interesting line that
we have here is this line over here so
mad equals new google new google maps
map document and so what happens is that
in here we create and you map object and
we are passing two arguments to create
this map this argument over here the
document format that's just it inside
that's just a division inside your
infection i'll file that I'm action
capture that that's where the mattress
and the mass actions is something that
we defined over here and it just tells
Google Apps how which certain type of
marijuana use and how we want to display
it and we can actually go to see the
documentation so this is just the
general you know Google Maps page and
then has a lot of information and here
you can see about different types that
it has and now there's an example and in
here for example there's an example code
you know how to create a new map so as
you can see we're calling your google
maps map and then you know catching you
to a certain element in our index HTML
file and then giving it the map options
right so we just like creating our your
lap here but we're not doing anything
with it now first we need to collect all
the locations from our resident and this
happens in this function over here
location under so what this is it's a
really actually very simple functions
and there's nothing happened that you
haven't seen are basically create an NPR
a-and
and we entered the locations from the
contacts here as the first item and then
loop over education section and the work
section and each location that we find
we enter it in in those locations are
going to be probably street addresses or
you know some sort of string and would
essentially want to translate those
locations into longest in line to get
into the relevant objects so that we can
push them so I can you know make them
independent into the map and so this as
you can see over here so at the end all
right we call locations equals location
finder right so we create this is like
new this is all happening inside enjoys
map so we create this new locations
around it has all of our locations and
we call an poster with this location
sorry
so let's go into pin poster that's so
poster has it actually uses an
additional service the place of service
which is not simply a part of google
maps but it is related to mr.
sorrentinos week will max and oh so
essentially this is the service is going
to translate those locations into our
options that we can add into the map the
first step that I need to do to do that
would be to create create the service
conditionally this service so this
happens in this line over here if we
want to see how the information on the
places library here is and so this
essentially enables the application to
search for places and this is you know
to make it work in addition to apply
next Romeo you have to add this line
over here in your index.html file and in
fact if you remember instructions were
told to uncomment one line in your index
dot HTML 5 and this is the line at your
current so essentially this is the line
that loads this additional library as
you can see there are several different
types of searches that you can perform
using
every you can join your by surgical tech
search and a bunch of other things this
sort of were using in our helper and
helpful dr. yes is a text search so this
is essentially essentially returns a
list of nearby places based on a string
and this is exactly what we needed
because in our resume builder doctor is
we represented you know different
locations
you know the different schools in
different places that you worked as
string so this is this is the
appropriate thing to use and so here's
you know a little more information of
what you need you know the different
type of things that you need to provide
in order to make us work but essentially
the basic things that you need is you
need a request and you need a callback
function so basically to do a search if
you're going to type service stop text
search and then you need to give to the
grounders question call back there was
contain a lot of things but the basic
thing that it has to contain would be a
word and the quarry items just supposed
to be a string location that you're
going to be searching for so as you can
see you
we have four look a little over all the
locations that reflect before and make
anyone else for each one of those and
you know with that location string and
then with this callback function of the
callback function is essentially the
function is going to handle whatever
text search of returns to put that in
that function as an input input to text
search and so we have actually defined
this callback function over here so this
is a function that takes two arguments
resultant status both arguments are
returned by text search services tells
you other service was able to return
something meaningful and then what
results continues is an area of
essentially longitude and latitude
languages while area because sometimes
there's more than one match so what
we're going to use the first one
essentially what this like that
who does its it tests whether you know
the status was which was returned was ok
whether we got like a valid results and
so it calls another function that we
have United but we have to find create
Macker with the first I am all this rain
and so essentially create my Park market
takes my location that was returning
from our text search and it composed it
converts it into a pen on the map
let's go look at it marker and so this
is our great American function any texts
an argument please data and so
essentially as you can you cancel that
guess how the place data object looks
like I'm because we can add this
latitude and longitude you I'm it also
has a four-minute dressed so we can get
all this from our place data and then
what we do is we create a new Google
Maps marker so this is the markers or
something that box provides so we can go
again looking to our markers function so
here we have all the markers so
essentially very straightforward
marketing find a location on the map and
there's a lot of heat that you can do in
terms of changing how the market appears
i'm so you can change the icon that
you're going to see I mean it has a
people i can but you can change that you
can attach an info window to it to
display additional information that you
were actually asked to do this in one of
the exercises in the transcript basics
class there's there's a lot you can do
but essentially so this is how you make
a move on you
marker essentially called google maps
are it has a position it has that it
needs to relax you and you know the text
that's going to be part of the market
property so as you can see here we are
this marker using our map this is the
location that we are taking place data
and the title is just essentially the
formula dressed
placed our return so and as you can see
over here we are also attaching an info
window we are creating a new info window
that is going to open when you click the
marker you can look a little bit about
you can see what about being focused
well yes let's take a step back a little
business there's been a lot of stuff
that we're talking about so basically
like I won't ask me what you were trying
to figure this out yourself your your
process was you were just stepping
through each function one at a time
right
yes right so basically you think about
like what did get guys like just if you
think it's that bad
she's already like just your expansion
don't have imagined that strategy
framework of how to look things up and
that's actually what you want to keep
things that I like to point out that
this is how you will develop your
strengths as a developer has most of the
time most developers have to know you
don't know all the function calls and
sometimes you have to work with like
pieces of good you're givin me no
previous project or just things that
somebody worked on you can have to
figure out what they did
if they're nice they're going to have
and you know you can have some comments
that have been helpful right arms are
you're not going to have comments or
even have comes that are less helpful so
you're going to have to kind of figure
out stuff
yeah so like that that's thing like what
the this is a common strategy like a lot
of developers use i personally use this
too is like if I I really nice tan color
as soon as I look at me I look at things
peace peace more piecewise function wise
and why a couple lines at a time and
make sure that I'm stepping through
understanding the logic and the flow of
how this develops this person not get
and then if I recognize the code that we
want to get deep into I needed and go in
and do a search and look at the
documentation and
usually there it is a popular library
such as little Google Maps there will be
a ton of documentation and there will be
a ton of discussions of people trying to
figure out what this does not take this
up you doing how does this word you then
do a lot of research and piece together
how things get done and Google abscess
I mean they they have a really good
documentation and that they also have
examples of how to use things like how
to build these things so it's really
helpful for example if you're trying to
build something from scratch it's really
helpful and if you're just trying to
figure out why this piece of cardboard
box then you can sort of like look at a
different objects that are created that
are using my feet up on those and see it
ok that's why they're calling this with
this you know as an argument and that's
why I have this is a callback function
ok now i got it oh right yeah so again
this is this is the most memorable this
will not magic it's just really knowing
how to approach the right truck doing
your research
yeah if it's something that routine
you've done this before use this before
them you know probably last but yeah
o ne futures wanna I think you just want
to understand like a piece of code that
somebody gave you that works and this
happens a lot like for example you're
going to be searching on stackoverflow
have to do something and you're going to
find this piece of code and you know
that somebody posted inside hey you want
to do this and use this code you can
just buy a copy and paste it is going to
work but it's always a good idea to kind
of take the time to understand my words
as well you know I mean obviously the
goal is to make it where some meat boy
but i think a greater goal would be to
understand why it works so that next
time you can commit yourself it's
actually really good
no dice to thank you thank you know in
the window
yeah and in folio was something that you
know you
we're actually asked to investigate a
little bit I in one of Pete quizzes you
maximize you okay yeah and so
essentially the way the way works with
Windows is that beyond a pop-up window
to this market is going to show up in
can display file and then essentially
i'm actually going to minimize this back
so that i can show you guys the
documentation on info windows over here
alright so you can see essentially 12
info window is really space that extra
damage and a pop-up window up on the mac
and given location
it has so basically it's just like a
little window to add a window to open i
went on an infowindow you essentially
want me to make anyone by calling your
google maps info me up i'm going to
concentrate and then you need to attach
it to your marker so essentially over
here we see I'm have to attach it to a
marker using a click event so to what
happens is that there's a listen her
that listens for whatever the
mark-to-market clicked this Inferno it
happened so this is essentially how you
add an info window and this can also
help you with the solution to the words
that's great well thank you that's hey
thanks for showing us that all
walkthrough for you know just
understanding google mass works in a
track resume this is actually we hope
this will be useful for you because in
its what project five you will have to
implement your own google maps from
scratch from here yet so you're gonna
have to be looking at that documentation
a lot more
yeah so it's good to start me start
thinking about how these work behind the
scenes so it's going to help you later
on in your project by because the
process is your neighborhood a project
and this is actually the project that we
do not give you any code for you
um yeah you're on your own here you
basically start
with Asia black slate so like for you
people who are at this stage at on
project you don't worry we will build
you up so don't be scared we're not
talking to you or anything we just
wanted to let you know to do a nice
picture like what's going to happen and
complete so good actually takes your
giving man you want this gets surprised</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
