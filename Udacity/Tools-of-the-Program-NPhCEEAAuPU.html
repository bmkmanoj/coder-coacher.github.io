you spend most of your time in
classrooms online we use a variety of
tools to mimic the classroom experience
we'll spend the bulk of this orientation
covering the tools that you'll use
during your time in the master's program
we'll talk about tools you'll use for
registering for classes we'll talk about
the learning management system you'll
use for submitting assignments
retrieving syllabi and accessing class
resources we'll talk about tools you'll
use to interact with your classmates
professors and teaching assistants we'll
talk about tools you'll use to access
lecture materials and course notes and
we'll talk about tools you'll use to
attend office hours retrieve grades tick
exams and manage your Georgia Tech
account we know that all this
information with the overwhelming right
now you don't need to worry about
completely understanding every tool we
talked about today we have just two
goals one to give you some initial
experience with the tools you'll be
using and two to make you aware of the
options and resources available to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
