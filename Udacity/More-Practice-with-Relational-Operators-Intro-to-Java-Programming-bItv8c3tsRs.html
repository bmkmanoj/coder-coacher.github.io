than or equal to sara is Chi plus 1 is
greater than Sara the opposite of Chi
plus one is greater than or equal to
Sara is Chi plus 1 is less than Sara and
the opposite of Chi plus 1 is not equal
to Sara is Chi plus 1 equals equals Sara
you may have thought that the opposite
of Chi plus 1 is less than or equal to
Sara should be cos 1 is greater than or
equal to Sara but the opposite has to
disagree for every possible value of Chi
and Sara let's look at a representative
set of examples our original expression
was k plus 1 is less than or equal to
Sara we found that when Chi has 3
Twitter followers and Sara has 4 Twitter
followers that's the boundary so I'm
using that case and two cases one on
each side of that boundary to compare
these three conditions to see which ones
are opposites when Chi has 3 and Sara
has 3 it's not true that Chi plus 1 is
less than or equal to Sara
when Chi has 3 and I have 4 this
condition is true when Chi has 3 and I
have 5 the condition is still true now
for the next condition we find that they
disagree on conditions that are not
right on the boundary but right on the
boundary they agree so these conditions
are not opposites but this last
condition is true for the first case
false for the boundary case and false
for the last case so it differs in every
case from the original condition
you could write out similar tables for
the other two original equations but I
think this is enough writing tables for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
