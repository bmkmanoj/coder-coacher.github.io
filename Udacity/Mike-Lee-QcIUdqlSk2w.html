course developer at Udacity and on the
iOS nanodegree and we're here at all
comp 2016 this week to talk with some of
the speakers get to know a little bit
about them their interest talk about
maybe some WWDC see stuff and it's
different things and I'm here with
Michael E thanks so much for for
chatting with us they really appreciate
it so we've gotten a chance to get to
know each other a little bit but for
everyone out there that doesn't know
Michael E could you give them a little
bit of an introduction all right sure
I'm an American engineer who lives in
the Netherlands I used to work for Apple
I had some Silicon Valley startups I've
done a lot of different things these
days I'm focusing on meta engineering so
what is meta engineering that sounds
like a really cool topic so many
engineering is basically engineering
engineers right you know I started life
as a pretty classical technologist you
know I was really into computers and
robots and space and science and all
that kind of stuff but I quickly came to
realize that the biggest problem that we
have is not the technical aspects of it
the biggest problem that we have are
more structural so for example if you
have two parts of a system say two
features of an application that don't
seem to communicate well with each other
it's probably because it was two
different teams that didn't communicate
well with each other right so I'm mostly
concerned like I don't really need to
teach you to be a better programmer I
need to teach you to be an ethical
programmer right I need to teach you how
to think about privacy in a real way my
my background is not in engineering my
background is actually in journalism and
medicine and so and by background I mean
my like schooling right and so when I
was in college I I didn't take a single
programming class but I did take ethics
classes right I had to study privacy and
so these are things that we're not
typically taught in technology because
because they're humanities but without
understanding ethics without
understanding how people are meant to
interact with each other I mean the way
I feel about it is this if you want to
be evil go be evil but most of us think
that we're doing good and then all this
evil happens by accident we don't know
why and a system has been developed over
millennia for avoiding doing evil by
accident and that is the system of
ethics and so it is much more it is much
better for the future of the stability
of the system to teach engineers about
ethics than it is to make engineers
better at programming there's all kinds
of great stuff wrapped up in that and
one of them that stands out to me is
kind of the soft skills and that's
something that we're working to teach
engineers what's something maybe like
one piece of advice you would give to a
budding engineer about like a soft skill
that could focus on to work better with
other engineers to create greater
products from a technical standpoint I
tend to have my entire workflow of be
automated and the automation uses the
accessibility system so it kind of like
automatically it gives you a view of the
system like if you can use a computer
that's one thing if the computer can use
a computer then it really is accessible
but it's more than that right it for
example how many of us have actually
closed our eyes and used the the phone
with voiceover on oh wow I never thought
of doing that you gotta yeah right how
can you have that experience otherwise
you know we tend to think of
accessibility as like like look I'm not
I'm not blind I'm a little hard of
hearing but i'm certainly not deaf you
know i have both of my hands now right
but what happens if i break an arm you
know what happens if I'm in the dark
right what happens if it's noisy where I
am so so I can't hear right like we we
all need accessibility sometimes and God
forbid what happens if something happens
to me in the future right so like most
of the work that I do on accessibility
is because it's kind of selfish it's
kind of for myself right because I want
to make sure that I can still use this
machine in all the ways that the machine
can be used for me yeah and you
definitely you can have blind spots if
you're not i mean i guess we sometimes
we forget we're designing these apps or
software for users who is that end user
so now that you're kind of meta
engineering
you're looking at engineers and trying
to figure out the best ways to make them
work is there a hey exercise that you
make them go through or lie help what
does your management look like a other
engineers are you working one-on-one and
doing your own mentorship it's a lot of
listening to be honest it's just a lot
of listening because people you can give
someone information but they have to be
able to sort of digest it and if you
just sort of present people with things
it's very hard for them to to learn that
stuff necessarily really people need to
people need to get there on their own
but they need to be led and so what
needs to happen is as their brains raise
objections you need to know to
understand those objections so that you
can you know sort of answer them and put
them in the right direction so it really
is it's kind of a case-by-case thing and
a lot of times I mean I've been a part
of this for a long time and there are
more people who have sat down and had a
conversation with me about what's going
on with themselves then I could ever
even attempt to remember and a lot of
those conversations I don't even
remember the conversations because it's
not like i sat down with a thing that I
wanted to tell them it's that i sat down
i listen to what they had to say it went
through the neurons that you know make
me me and that is the collection of all
of the stuff that I've learned and then
I sort of return that information to
them in that processing and and work
with them to to help them understand it
and often to gain a better understanding
myself powerful stuff man it's great
that you're talking about this how did
you move I guess how is your developer
journey kind of led you to where you are
now it sounds like you just have such a
great world perspective on different
things from being a lot of different
places so I'm I am a person who has
never belonged anywhere right I'm a
person who has always been in between i
I'm a mixed-race person I know that
because I've been living in Northern
Europe for 45 years I'd look pretty
white but like it's really weird for me
to pass his way because that's very
recent right so you know my father was
from Japan white as a race is a very
racist race right because white is a is
a one drop race right one drop away from
white and you're no longer white
japanese as a race a culture whatever
ana paula is equally xenophobic right
and so I i am the combination of two
ethnic groups that will not accept me as
their own right like I was very I grew
up in Hawaii which is full of Asians and
so I was very kind of like nationalistic
Lee Japanese which is a stupid thing
because it's not like Japanese people
will accept me either right and so I'm
just sort of like stuck between the two
but it's not just that it's like did I
grew up in Hawaii which is both the
United States and also nothing like the
United States right I grew up speaking a
pidgin English which is which is which
is not exactly English and not exactly a
foreign language right I i'm an engineer
but i didn't go to school for
engineering there is no place there is
no people right where where I can be
there I could be like this is my place
and these are my people the only place
where I can be that's like that is a
place where everyone is welcome how do
we get there what's your you know it's
really funny because I I grew up very
just naive right just like a kid is
right and and I've sort of like had
these things you know taught to me right
like one day I'm told oh yeah by the way
there's a thing called white and you're
not yet and then as I got older I
started to get really interested in
these things I started to really sort of
notice these things and I started to try
to talk about them but they made people
extremely uncomfortable right and my
friends were always arguing with me and
telling me to shut up and so as I
traveled around the world and and look
for a place to be I found Amsterdam you
know which is which is a very incredibly
diverse place much like Hawaii why grubs
a very incredibly diverse place and that
was how in a very literal sense I found
that that that place where I can be but
that place is not necessarily a physical
place that place is really a it's like a
state of being for us right and so it
really comes down to doing the hard
mental exercise of thinking about these
things of trying to understand people of
trying to understand concepts that are
scarier offensive and then trying to
trying to share that information I mean
one of the reasons why I talk about this
stuff is because it helps me to
understand this stuff better and so I
guess the short answer to be long
unnecessarily long
r Anthony's Ron is is just like this
right by talking to other people right
by going places by meeting people by
doing things by having experiences by
being open-minded that's how we get
there well so you've been at this for
how long have you been coding I mean I
got my first computer when I was a
senior in high school so that would have
been right at the dawn of 1994 but we
didn't have the internet yet not in
Hawaii and so like there was one person
who had a computer that had five modems
and he he paid money for five phone
lines and you could pay like five bucks
a month in order to like have an account
on this thing so you could call in like
chat it was real time you hit a you know
T on your keyboard it was a group t like
there was no like anything because it
was like so slow and you know we we had
a massive bot war you know and a secure
like robots it's like yeah man we're
having bought words 20 years ago was
that programming I mean I sort of i Jes
you know it was just kind of like a fun
hobby and it really wasn't until into
the 2000s when I actually started doing
it professionally what was the first app
that you built so you know you start for
this airline we built a simple online
training system and the the airline ran
basically a test like we'll pick the
smallest group in the airline and we'll
try using this online training system
instead of our current system and that
test saved them like a hundred thousand
dollars and it was an annual recurrent
training and so that was that was the
thing that that got me that job start of
the career oh so was it both a web app
and like also a mobile experience or was
this kind of web leading you into so
back then mobile experience met like you
could pick up your computer and carry it
over here and plug it in so it wasn't
really a concern though it was a it was
it was a standards-compliant XHTML one
point 0 site using javascript hosted on
asp but was really funny is that the so
we were not employed by the airline for
the purpose of writing code because
there's it there's a department for that
but that department was not very good at
their jobs or not very eager to do the
work that was being asked him though
they're on IT department they're not
really in the job of making
apps anyway right so there weren't
really into it but at the same time they
really didn't want anybody else to be
into it either because it's their
territory and so they put all these
bizarre restrictions on us and so I
ended up having to do a lot of really
strange things normally if you have a
database of information you store that
in a database but we were not allowed to
use a database for whatever reason and
so I ended up writing a database
management system using the XML
spreadsheet transformation language or
xslt so basically every time you would
change something in the database you
would transform the existing database
into the the next state which i think is
probably the most ludicrous piece of
software I've ever heard of to this very
day but it did the job so Mike for
everyone that's watching that that may
want to be getting into development into
either iOS developer II any kind of
development what is your what's your tip
what's your kind of guiding light your
advice she would give to them I think
that a lot of us tend to be loners I'm
very introverted myself I think a lot of
us are we like computers because they're
simple but it's a real risk to kind of
lock yourself in a room and try to do it
on your own I think that I if I look at
my own career I kind of went from from
from starting out to really becoming
good at what i was doing to really
getting to the point where i am now and
the difference has always been expanding
the number of people that that i know
you know at first i'm trying to do it on
my own and i only get so far and then i
start working with a mentor and and that
really accelerated me but the best piece
of advice I ever got was there's a great
community full of people out there you
need to go and start meeting people in
the community and the more people I've
met the more I've learned and the better
person but also the better engineer I've
become is there anything on the horizon
stuff that's been discussed rumors
around WWDC things that you're excited
about that you're ready to see or hoping
to see you know I've started referring
to Apple as the least evil of giant evil
tech corporations and that really I
think continues to be true and we see
that with I think a lot of the privacy
implications of the stuff that Apple
talked about for example it seems like
every other large tech company is
is like privacy to them is a thing that
they need to overcome in order for their
business model to work and Apple seems
to be the only technology company that
continues to not see their users as the
product itself Apple seems to be the
only large company that remains focused
on actually providing the best
experience for their users and the best
experience for the user is always going
to be an experience that respects their
privacy and has their informed consent
yeah they definitely take a how do we
empower make the lives of our customers
better it's something that I talk about
a lot we really have to balance and
stuff you know and it's increasingly
dangerous I think especially with the
Snowden revelations it really our worst
fears were kind of realized which is
that a lot of the technology that we
thought was really cool every tool is
also a weapon like it's great that we
have little cameras it's great that we
have awesomeeee microphones it's great
that we have GPS trackers but it also
means that now there's cameras and
microphones with GPS trackers anywhere
right like I understand that people are
really excited about being able to talk
to the computer but as we do that we're
also teaching computers how to
understand humans we really need to be
more focused on teaching humans to
understand computers and not the other
way around but the fact is most of the
world's technology is driven from the
United States and most of the United
States innovation is driven by one way
or the other military funding and that
seems to be largely interested in tools
of surveillance and control so we need
to really be careful in how we think of
these things and where we decide to to
bring areas of innovation so from
somebody that has this global
perspective and we have a lot of
students all around the world that
aren't around Silicon Valley even though
that seems to be a birthplace of a lot
of ideas howdy or what's the advice you
give to them about you know either
whether it's finding jobs or whether
it's just like being informed about it
or making an impact about it I think
that one of the most important things
that people need to understand is that
you you don't you shouldn't fetishize
Silicon Valley too much people seem to
think that it's a magical place where
everything happens and it's the only
magical place where everything happens
but the reality is that's not true there
are great technical communities all over
the world and even if there aren't great
technical communities you can build a
great technical community when I first
arrived in Amsterdam as a city it was
fantastic
but as a technical community it wasn't
really there wasn't really one there are
a lot of technologists there but
everyone seemed to complain about the
same thing which is that seems like I'm
the only person here doing technology
there's not really a community and so
you know we actually started the
organization to to bring those people
together and to build that community and
now we see Amsterdam really having a
technology output profile that's just
it's just growing I mean they're calling
it the third Golden Age so everybody
anywhere in the world looking at Silicon
Valley and thinking one day I'll get
there and then this thing will really
take off now the thing that's preventing
you from getting this thing done
tomorrow is you right anywhere in the
world anywhere you are you can be doing
the stuff that you're trying to do you
don't need the valley to make innovation
and in fact it's better for the world if
innovation is made all over the world
and not in just one place very cool so
whether it's murder lands whether it's
all comp just these types of community
events why should a new student or
somebody that's new to mobile
development why should they go to these
you know you you you meet people who
know things you don't know who
experience things the way you don't
experience them honestly everything I've
everything I've gotten every every all
the power behind me has been the people
that I've met the people I've worked
with you find people who know the things
you want to know you find people who
work at the companies that you want to
work with you you find kind of
everything you need honestly I mean I
think that community is the most
powerful tool that humans have have ever
developed and I think that as as
developers community is is also our most
powerful tool so just wrapping up here
what if you could condense it to one
sentence all the things we've talked
about the things you're speaking about
this week what is the one piece of
advice that for somebody entering into
this field that you would give them if
you think that you don't have the power
to change the things that are making the
world terrible in your eyes then you're
wrong you have the power you have the
power thanks so much Mike it's been a
pleasure talking with you we really
preciate taking the time
