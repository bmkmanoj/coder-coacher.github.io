see this from a different perspective
let me ask you a question that's
actually a personal interest in
curiosity to me I'm teaching in this
class a number of elements of functional
programming list comprehensions in
python filtering a list to retain only
some required elements and i noticed
that in javascript you included the
ability to create an anonymous function
with the function keyword for students
initially that might be a little bit
confusing because declaring a function
at the top level also uses the function
key word but we can get past that with
the grammar I'm curious why did you
think it was important to include the
ability to have anonymous functions so
JavaScript had to live in the shadow of
Java but it was its own language and the
original pitch the sort of fraudulent
pretense for getting the Netscape was to
do scheme now I didn't have time to do
scheme and I didn't do anything as
prettiest scheme but javascript is a
language with first-class functions and
functions are the main building blocks
so it's important not simply to have
function declarations and require you to
name them and put them at a certain
level in nesting but to allow you to
express them freely as anonymous
functions or even named function
expressions and this is incredibly
popular today this is used in lieu of
modules and to make sort of super
constructors and class systems in
JavaScript today using functions and
function expressions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
