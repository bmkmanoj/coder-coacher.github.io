the first step miles driven is 50,000
the first miles per gallon is ten so
that's 5,000 the price per gallon is
four five thousand times four is twenty
thousand now moving on to the next step
the purchase price for the first car is
fifteen thousand plus the twenty
thousand from over here gets me a total
cost of thirty five thousand over the
lifetime of the car with a second car
again we drive 50 thousand miles
now the miles per gallon is fifty fifty
thousand over fifty is a thousand times
four as we have four dollars per gallon
is four thousand for the gas cost the
purchase price was thirty thousand plus
the gas cost four thousand gets me to
thirty four thousand now let's go on
with the algorithm is total cost one
less than total cost - no it's not
thirty five thousand is bigger than
thirty four thousand so the algorithm
tells us to buy car - what a relief I
never wanted to buy that one in the
first place but now I have a procedure
that is unambiguous executable and
terminating that tells me what car to
buy so this is a great example of an
algorithm it is a recipe of steps each
of which is so simple that a computer or
a human can execute them and it reaches
an answer now you will notice that this
algorithm here was written up in some
mixture of plain English and math not in
Java code or not in any other computer
language this is called pseudo code and
pseudo code is really important when you
want to develop an algorithm before you
get to code it up in Java or another
programming language what most
programmers do when they need to solve a
complex problem is they first get out a
sheet of paper and describe the problem
in pseudocode and then they write it in
Java pseudocode doesn't have anywhere
near as many rules as Java does but so
it's a good idea to restrict oneself to
simple constructs in pseudocode let me
show you what those would be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
