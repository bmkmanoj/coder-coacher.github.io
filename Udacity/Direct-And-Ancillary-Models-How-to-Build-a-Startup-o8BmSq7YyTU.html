set direct sale
this is sale of ownership of the right
to a physical product and in a physical
channel some best examples are you know
buying cars Ford or General Motors or
Nissan or going into a Walmart buying
products in their massive stores or
going to your local hardware store and
buying some thermometers or as we said
earlier there could be a usage fee
strategy and the fee is proportional to
how much of the service you used what's
an example of companies that do usage
fees well every time you use your cell
phone either for voice or data you're
paying a fee proportional to the
services or if you're a web developer
Amazon's and web service has been the
kind of the reason why the web is
exploded because you no longer need to
buy hardware but you're paying per
computing or per database size or
anything else or FedEx you're now paying
for every envelope or package you ship
or what's really interesting is electric
power always used to be metered and
proportional to the service but now new
solar companies have decided that
instead of selling solar panels their
business model is will install the
panels for free but will also become a
utility these are you should see revenue
strategies subscription fee instead of
paying per use why don't we pay kind of
a flat fee every month for continuous
access to a service what's an example of
that
well salesforce.com we pay literally for
a continued use of the product or maybe
a better example is Netflix with all you
could eat downloads for videos want to
watch infinite number of movies you pay
just a flat subscription fee there are
other revenue models like renting we
rent houses but the best example for me
is a check in the book business now all
of a sudden I could temporarily rent
books or borrow lenses which says listen
instead of buying expensive camera gear
which you might just use intermittently
for photo shoots like a
pencil Hasselblad's or expensive lenses
why don't you just go in and rent them
for a temporary amount of time and of
course in the US and overseas car
rentals are the exact example for
transportation instead of buying a car
in every city when you get off a plane
it's very easy and we just kind of take
for granted that you could have
temporary access to automobiles drive
them for hours or days and return them
another type of revenue model is a
licensing it's a fee for use for
intellectual property IP what's an
example of using somebody's IP I can't
think of one well if you ever used any
software from any computer manufacturer
congratulations if you ever read the
fine print from Microsoft or Electronic
Arts or even Apple you don't own your
software you're actually using it under
a license surprise that means you can't
duplicate it and make a million copies
and give it away to your friends you
have agreed with Microsoft or Electronic
Arts that you're just a licensing it for
use on one computer or if they're
feeling generous this year maybe you're
a laptop and your phone and one desktop
machine but you do not have infinite
rights to their intellectual property
another type of revenue strategy could
be an intermediary now sometimes we find
this in marketplaces and it's a fee for
bringing two parties together involved
in a transaction what's an example well
the most popular one right now is Airbnb
they don't own all those places they're
renting but what they do is essentially
a dating service between you and someone
who wants to make money in renting their
apartment for a night or a couple nights
so you the traveler who need a place to
stay but don't want to stay in an
expensive hotel use their site as an
intermediary or Etsy or even better Cafe
Press or e-trade all these are kind of
brokers and by the way in the physical
world the classic is real estate brokers
and they don't own the house and they
don't own you but there are matchmaking
service for between you and the property
you want to buy another strategy
a revenue stream could be advertising so
again if you remember our conversation
about Google Google strategy and
Facebook and spice and mint it's all
about creating massive numbers of users
so I could monetize fancy name for make
money from all those users not from
making them pay because last time I
looked at Google search didn't cost me
anything directly but Google is actually
using me to sell to advertisers they're
saying hey you want to get in front of
people like Steve all you have to do is
pay us for access to these groups of
individuals and in fact if we're very
sophisticated we could segment them by
specific keywords or interests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
