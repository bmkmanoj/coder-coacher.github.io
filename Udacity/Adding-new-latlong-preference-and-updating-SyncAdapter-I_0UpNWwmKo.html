result will be returned by the place
picker if we get a place we know that it
will have an address but that address
could be anything from a city name to a
business name or even an empty string so
we can reliably form a request to the
weather service off of this string alone
however a place object also contains a
latitude and longitude and open weather
map supports queries by lat long so what
we need to do is to store the address as
our location string but store the lat
long as our location query to do this
let's begin with the simple things first
we need to declare to new preference
keys one for latitude and one for
longitude then we can create new utility
methods to help us out one each to get
the value of the latitude and longitude
out of their preferences and then a
third method to check for the existence
of these preferences these preferences
will be our indicator that we are using
a place picker location instead of a
user interred string location if the
user decides to replace their location
with a string later on will wipe these
preferences as a signal to stop forming
the query with the lat/long in sync
adapter instead of always building the
query based off of the location string
we want to potentially build a query
using a lat long value so first we need
to check if we have a lot long to work
with and if we do we're going to build
the request using lat and lon however if
we don't we're going to build it the way
we were before using our location string
the rest of the URI builder remains
unchanged however since we are dependent
on the existence of a lat long
preference as a signal that we are using
a place picker location we need to wipe
those preferences when the user enters a
location string manually so in settings
activity in on shared preference changed
you'll need to do this whenever the
location is updated this method is an
automatic call back that is invoked by
the dialog preference class because our
place picker was an intent launched by
settings activity it won't ever trigger
this callback and so this is a safe
place to reliably wipe the place bicker
lat long whenever we have a manual entry
because we don't trigger the call back
when returning from the place picker
will need to tell
sync adapter that something has changed
in on activity result first we'll update
the preference summary string in our
settings UI and then we will ask our
sync adapter to fetch new weather data
this should all happen after the new
preferences are written and that is why
we use commit instead of apply when
we're writing to our shared preferences
commit ensures that the preferences are
ready in time for our sync adapter
update whereas apply is asynchronous and
can't make the same guarantee now as for
actually writing the lat/long
preferences I'm leaving that to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
