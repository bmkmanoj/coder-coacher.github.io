known as blind signatures this gives us
a way that associate a unique ID with a
bill to be able to detect double
spending but doesn't allow the bank to
associate the unique IDs on the bills
with the person who acquires that bill
so here's the idea Alice will deposit
her hundred dollars in the bank and
along with the bill shall generate a
message that says bill number are a sum
unique ID generated by Alice indivisible
Prime's bank owns the bearer a hundred
dollars and she'll go to the bank give
the banker the hundred dollar bill and
ask the bank to sign the message in to
make it a blind signature though she'll
insist that a banker wear a blindfold
before bringing up the message m and the
banker will have to sign it without
being able to see this message and the
bank will give that signed message back
to Alice this protocol has an obvious
flaw in it the bank doesn't know what
it's signing so Alice could deposit $100
and ask the bank to sign a message for a
hundred gazillion dollars when someone
deposits that bill the banker will no
longer be smiling the solution to this
is a technique known as cut and choose
this is somewhat similar to what we saw
in auditing for mixed nets and it has
lots of applications to other
cryptographic problems as well the way
we would do that with this game is
instead of just generating one message
like this Alice would generate a larger
number of messages let's say a hundred
of them send them all to the bank the
banker who's no longer blindfolded or
phony will randomly pick one of these
messages let's say he picks message 38
we'll look at the other ones each one of
those should have a message like this
but with a different random value check
that they're all okay if they're all
okay then without looking at message 38
then the banker will be blindfolded and
signed message 38 the point of this is
that Alice generates all the messages
transfers into the bank but the bank
doesn't see them until the bank randomly
picks one since the bank is picking the
one to sign randomly and inspecting all
the others the probability of Alice
being able to cheat without getting
caught is 1 in the number of messages so
that could work with blindfolds we'd
have to be careful how we deliver the
messages to the bank and then let the
banker pick one and
and see them without the mindful but
that could work not very convenient
though so what we want to do is figure
out a way to do this using cryptography
instead of blindfolds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
