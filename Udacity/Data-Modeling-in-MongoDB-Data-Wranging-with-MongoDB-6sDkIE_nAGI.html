automobile info box in particular for
the Tesla Model S in this lesson we're
going to use info box data throughout
our examples involving MongoDB so let's
take a look at the data that's
represented in this info box
manufacturer we have production years
model years several different assembly
plants a designer class body style with
two elements five door and liftback
and a number of other fields so what I'd
like to do here is talk about how we
might model this data in MongoDB as
documents using the JSON like syntax I
mentioned earlier so in modeling this
data let's start with some of the scalar
valued fields that are here
here we can see scalar fields for
manufacturer class and body style we can
also model a couple of array fields here
for production model years and layout so
here in our JSON like syntax for MongoDB
we've modeled that same data using array
valued fields now we could model the
designer field as just a single string
but to show an alternative we might also
model it as a simple person document as
follows and here we have a document with
a designer field that has a nested
document within it for the designer and
last putting the idea of array fields
and embedded documents together who
might represent the assembly data in
this example like this with an assembly
field that has an array containing
embedded documents for each of the
assembly plans so a MongoDB
our entire document for the Tesla Model
S might look something like this with a
mixture of fields that are scalars array
valued and embedded documents one of the
many cool things about this is that
MongoDB natively supports a very common
big data format that being JSON and by
support I mean that we can store data
items structured this way in our
database and do queries that would say
for example identify all documents where
the city of assembly is Fremont driving
down the hierarchy to actually pull out
matches for this piece of data even
though it's nested several layers deep
within an individual document</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
