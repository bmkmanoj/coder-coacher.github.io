extends to the end of the line by
pressing it with the number sign or the
pound sign or the hash sign javascript
has the same idea but instead the
comments start with two slashes and then
continue to the end of the line this
time I'll write the rule for you here's
a rule corresponding to comments that go
to the end of the line in JavaScript
they start with a slash and then another
slash and then you can have anything
that's not our special newline character
as many of those as you want and the
maximal munch rule means we're going to
eat up all of those characters that we
possibly can and then rather than
returning that as a token we throw it
away because it's a comment
documentation for the user so let's test
our knowledge of this rule with a quiz
I've written out four sequences of input
and I'd like you to indicate which of
these four sequences would yield
identifier identifier number given the
rules we've been talking about for
JavaScript you've seen how we define
identifiers how we define numbers and
what starts an end-of-line comment here
are four different lines which ones give
us identifiers identifiers number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
