different stakeholders towards the same
goals first everyone needs to have a
shared view on what the current
situation is what are the goals what are
the current practices and flows all of
the stakeholders should participate and
work together to formulate the end goals
shared input generally creates shared
responsibility and ownership people are
willing to work together if their
thoughts and opinions are being heard
it's important to have a shared view on
problems and identify and eliminate
bottlenecks the bottlenecks can be
inside departments or between them it's
not really important as long as they're
being addressed and it's also important
to have shared benefits amongst the team
you want to make sure that you have all
the involved stakeholders to get the
benefit of a new product release to
achieve that you need to define and
measure key performance indicators for
the whole cross-functional team you
cannot improve what you cannot measure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
