templating capabilities to add custom
data to our app we'll be going through a
lot of detail here and I highly suggest
that you follow along with your dev
tools open navigating through the source
code yourself digging into a framework
source code is the best way to really
see how it works under the hood as we're
going through this don't get bogged down
with all the code focus on how the
template gets converted from HTML to a
function that's right a function a
function that waits to get called with
data here's the app we'll be using as we
work through this material and this is
the HTML file for the app let's look at
how these rows end up like this when the
template starts out like this there are
a couple of things we need to pay
attention to with the template first is
the ID here it will be used to select
the script tag and its contents the
second thing are these characters here
and here these are called delimiter x' a
delimiter is just a fancy name for a
sequence of one or more characters used
to form a boundary we need these
delimiter x' to separate the HTML from
what will become JavaScript variables
these delimiters are broken into
starting delimiter x' here and ending
ones here this specific sequence of
characters is the default for underscore
if i open underscores is in a new pane
we can see them here see how interpolate
has the angle bracket % an equal sign
and the closing delimiters here this
middle section captures anything between
the starting and ending delimiters
evaluate interpolate and escape all have
different starting delimiter x' we'll
see why this is important and how these
will be used later so we have this
template and it's filled with these
special delimiter x' but how does it get
converted to what's seen in the browser
in at j/s on this line the template is
fetched from the DOM and is HTML content
is returned as a string this string
version of the template is then passed
into underscores template function this
template function is where all the magic
happens let's take a sneak peek at what
the template function does by copying
this code and pasting it into the
console we can look at the
result of the template function by
checking the source property the
template function returns a function
itself functions are extremely powerful
and the template function makes use of a
JavaScript constructor function let's
look at how a constructor function works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
