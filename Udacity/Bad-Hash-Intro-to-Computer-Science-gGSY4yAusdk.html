know about modulo we're ready to define
a hash function so let's remember what
our hash function should do so the hash
function takes two inputs it takes the
keyword and it takes the number of
buckets and it's outputting a number
between 0 and buckets minus 1 that gives
us the position where that string
belongs and we see in the function Ord
that takes a 1 letter string and maps
that to a number and we've seen the
modulus operator that takes a number and
a modulus and produces as a result a
remainder that we'd get when we divide
that number by the modulus so now we can
use those to define a hash function I'm
going to start by giving you a really
bad hash function so let's define a
procedure and we'll call it bad hash
string to make sure we remember that
it's really bad and it takes as inputs
the keyword and the number of buckets
and we're going to output the bucket
based on the first letter in the keyword
so we'll use Ord on the first letter and
we'll use modulo the number of buckets
and that's our simple hash function for
the quiz I want you to answer all the
reasons why that's bad and remember what
bad hash string does is take the first
letter in the keyword turn it into a
number using Ord and then find that
value modulo the number of buckets here
are the possible reasons check all of
the reasons that apply the first is it
takes too long to compute the second is
there's at least one input keyword for
which bad hash string will produce an
error the third is if the keywords are
distributed like words in English then
some of the buckets will get too many
words others will get too few and the
fourth choice if the number of buckets
is large then there's some buckets that
will never get any keywords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
