that you need to know about splay trees
and the first is that it's a
self-balancing tree which means that if
we insert nodes in sorted order normally
in a binary search tree that would cause
us to build a tree that looks something
like this as soon as you can see this is
a very bad kind of a binary search tree
because here to do a lookup we're going
to have to walk all of the nodes in a
tree and we've lost this nice
logarithmic property that made lookups
inserts and deletes extremely fast the
way I'm self-balancing binary search
tree works is as you add elements to the
tree it has some sort of a balancing
procedure that keeps the thing
approximately balanced so the tree
operations remain very fast and if you
look at the literature if it turns out
there are tons and tons of different
data structures but offer self-balancing
binary search trees and the fast ones of
these end up being somewhat complicated
and display tree is really one of the
simplest examples of a self-balancing
binary search tree and the
implementation that we're going to look
at in a minute contains something like
100 lines of code so the other thing you
need to know about splay trees before
you didn't get into the code is it has
the really cool property that when we
access a node so let's say we do a
lookup of this node here which contains
seven what's going to happen is as a
side effect of the lookup that node is
going to get migrated up to the root and
then whatever was previously if the root
is going to be pushed down and possibly
some sort of a balancing operation is it
happen but the point is is that
frequently accessed elements end up
being pushed towards the root of the
tree and therefore future accesses to
those elements become even faster so
this is sort of a really nifty feature
of the splay tree so we're going to do
now is look at an open source Python
splay tree it's basically a random data
structure that I found on the web and it
happens to implement a splay tree it
comes with its own test suite and we're
going to look at what kind of code
coverage that this test suite gets on
display tree</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
