partitioning is the kernighan-lin
algorithm by the way the G and Qurna hen
is silent that's new as in the
wildebeest not the free-software thing
which has a hard G as in goo so it's new
not good new got it the idea behind the
KL algorithm is simple give it a graph
divide the vertices into two subsets of
equal or nearly equal size yes any split
will do I'm serious
anyone you want it's okay go ahead oh
for goodness sake just pick a partition
already let's define the cost of this
partitioning to be the number of edges
that go between v1 and v2
now imagine that a magic beam hands you
two equal sized subsets of v1 and v2
let's call these subsets x1 and x2
imagine that you were to swap these two
subsets naturally you would expect the
cut size to change but by how much
to answer this question in a formal way
let's start with some definitions
consider one vertex let's call it a
which lives on one side of a partition
define its external cost as the number
of edges that land in the other
partition in this cartoon a's external
cost denoted a one of a is equal to
three edges define a similar external
cost e two of B for any vertex B that
lives in v2 next define the notion of an
internal cost the internal cost will
count the number of edges from a vertex
to other vertices that live in the same
partition from these definitions you can
write down the cost of a partition as
follows it's the cost of the partition
ignoring a and B plus the external cost
of a the external cost of B and minus
some constant so what's this constant
you need that constant to account for a
possible edge between a and B the
constant is 1 if there's an edge there
and 0 otherwise
but why subtracted ah that is a terrific
question and you should take a moment to
ponder it now suppose you swap a and B
what's the new cost well any edge that
was incident on a that was previously
external is now internal same thing goes
for B so
to get the new cost let's start with the
old cost ignoring a and B and then add
some adjustments the adjustments
involved the internal costs of a and B
plus the constant again hey what's with
the plus constant now now let's look at
the change in cost that's the old cost
minus the new cost after some algebra
you get this the larger this changed the
better because it means a larger
decrease in the cost let's call this
cost the gain from swapping a and B by
the way do you see that it's possible
that gain of a B could actually be
negative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
