and how it's pretty normal to have
around forty percent player retention
after just one day uncle what do you
think so many players leave after just
the first day of playing a game well
it's very hard to make a game that's
engaging for everybody so people might
leave after trying it out and finding
it's not a great fit for example kids
tend to have a lot more time on their
hands than adults so they prefer longer
games with more fun storylines that
makes sense everyone plays games a
little differently so what can game
developers do to keep players interested
most successful games have a target
audience they know they can't appeal to
everyone and so they focus on a specific
age group or a type of gamer and try to
design a game that is targeted to that
audience I think I have a great idea for
a game that appeals to people around my
age check it out what do you think it
seems fairly simple maybe you can make
it harder by adding some goals or
obstacles good idea how about I bounce
the ball through a ring of fire and into
a goal that's more like it when you're
thinking about your game and deciding
what it looks like and how difficult it
is to play you should always put
yourself in the players shoes and think
about what will be most exciting for
them ask yourself are they younger or
older hardcore gamers are more casual
exactly it's important to make your game
pace fit your player skill level like
adding a ring of fire and goals makes
bouncing ball a lot more challenging and
fun let's look at some examples of game
apps that do this well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
