about the this is like a bad history of
reinforcement learning so not that it's
a bad history it's just badly told so
but the basic idea is this once upon a
time and we're gonna call it say the
1930s people observed that if you put an
animal this is supposed to be a rat in
in a you know box say and give it
choices of looking in place B and place
a and say one of them has cheese in it
the other one doesn't but it can't see
which because you know the doors are
closed and let's say that we
consistently do something like this we
turn on a red light
whenever the cheese is in the a place
and we turn on a blue light whenever the
cheese is in the B place and what you
observe is if you do this consistently
then what you find is that if the animal
sees a stimulus like the red light going
on and it takes an action like peeking
inside that or sticking its head inside
the box a and it gets a reward which in
this case would be getting to eat some
cheese that that setup strengthens its
response to this stimulus in other words
in the future when it sees the red light
it's going to be more likely to go in
and look in box a and this notion of
strengthening you can think of it as
reinforcing the connection reinforcing
just means strengthening mmm
so this was studied for a long time and
there's there's a tremendous amount of
interesting research about this but if
you start to you know think about it as
a computer scientist a natural way of of
kind of thinking about what this problem
is is that you know a stimulus is kind
of like a state and an action is kind of
like an action and a reward well I kind
of stole these words but it's kind of
like a reward and it leads you to this
idea that really what you want to do is
figure out how to choose actions to
maximize reward as a function of the
state and so we started to take this
concept and we called it reinforcement
learning because that's what the
psychologists we're calling it but for
us it just means reward maximization
this notion of strengthening is really
not part of the story for us at all so
we're really taking this word and using
it you know Rob hmm well that all makes
sense except for one thing which is the
idea that this happened in the 1930s
because we all know that rat dinosaurs
did not exist in the 1930s yeah they
well they went extinct in the 40s hmm
there's this one little epilogue to this
story which I find really kind of
amusing and that is the computer
scientist did pretty well at figuring
out algorithms for solving problems like
this and the psychologist really do care
about how stimuli and and and motor
actions and reward all interact with
each other and they've turned to the
computer scientists to say how might the
brain be doing this what what is the
problem that the brain actually might be
solving and so guess what word they
borrowed back when they started to think
about these things
reinforcements so now they talk about
reinforcement learning and they don't
mean reinforcement either they mean
reward maximization so we won I don't
think that was really our plan but but
it is it's nice to know that we had some
you know impact oh that's very good you
brought planning back into it and so
they learned because of our plan that's
pretty good Michael all right so that's
the end of this aside okay let's go
let's go back to learning things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
