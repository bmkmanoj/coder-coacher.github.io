developer here at Udacity and we're
joined by James lumer for our fireside
chats thanks for being with us glad to
be here oh so we just met would you mind
telling the students a little bit about
yourself give them a quick introduction
so primarily I'm an iOS developer mobile
development I'm an independent
consultants which means I work for
myself I've set up my own company that
does development for other companies
that needs a little extra help or higher
level guidance on the app's they want to
rights or someone just handle the dirty
stuff they don't really have the budget
diet to hire full-time mobile developers
because they're expensive so I work with
other companies and help them build
software was there a certain moment a
defining moment that kind of brought you
to iOS development well before that I
was doing enterprise work dotnet that
type of thing and I was independent so I
was consulting and I was working you
know staff augmentation staff fog type
of work where you go to a office 40
hours a week and they pay by the hour
i'll do it for three to six months at a
time so i was doing work like that and
was doing fine and one of the gigs i
found one of the projects i found was
going to have a mobile app an iphone app
and this was i OS for had just come out
and i raised my hand with people that
brought me on the project's done like
look I'll buy a mac if you let me work
on the iphone app and they're like okay
so i bought the mac and jumped in that
was with bow no touch now it's called
xamarin so the sea sharka so that was my
first project doing mobile so i already
knew c sharp as a language pretty well
but the iphone part was very different
but i just got I got the chance to learn
on the job which most people don't but
if you volunteer you know sometimes you
can be put in the right positions right
so you started with samer and then for
iOS develop my first project was yeah
xamarin are you still doing work in
c-sharp or like other kind of methods
other than say objective-c or Swift no
that was the last time I did any real
development with xamarin okay so it
since then it's been all native
objective-c
and I've been writing mostly Swift for
the past year and half are mostly apps
that you're working on or maintaining
are they a mix of both languages are you
interrupting between are you just going
straight Swift for all the new stuff
you're right so for new code definitely
with new project I would go Swift so I
worked on a project about a year and a
half kind of half time that was all
Swift okay so a new project I would
generally start with Swift some of the
classic apps I I maintain for apps for
other companies or do like different
ings where there's some code re-written
if it's already in objective-c I'll
usually leave it you started xamarin and
now you're with sharp five software and
Minneapolis yep sharp five software is
my company okay it's mainly me I do most
the development I do have other
colleagues that are also independent
that I bring on different projects if I
need some more expertise already a
little bit of help but mainly its
immediate just a front for the
development work i do now for newcomers
would you recommend learning Swift they
need to know objective-c and where do
you draw the line it's it's tough i
would say learn Swift do that you're
gonna need to know at least I'm not a
read objective-c study the things that
are going to benefit you two to three
years down the line right no don't don't
concentrate what's on going on right now
go figure out what's going to happen be
important three and three years down the
line you know and Swift is way faster
than I thought it would it's two years
old I thought it would be a very slow
process adoption and it's going very
fast you're getting need to know about
to see you need to know how to read it
most example code that exists people of
solutions is an objective C so you need
to at least understand the differences
but I would start with Swift it's
definitely a lot easier to look at oh
it's a than objective-c Jeff to see is
tough for a lot of developers even
experienced developers I call it fear of
brackets yeah you know it's it's a mind
meld just to look at it and know how to
make sense starting a line with three
brackets just because you know you have
to it took a while for me to get used to
it but once you get into like the flow
and the reason behind objective c you
really like it is language i love
I think it's a great language i still
like writing in objective-c we got a
roundabout picture now about you and I
kind of what has led you to where you
are now in iOS development and mobile
development is there any kind of stand
out subjects that you would recommend to
somebody that's trying to get entry
level position as an iOS developer what
they should know yet i mean the bread
butter stuff is the UI kit how to do new
controllers have things presenting in
navigation trawlers understand the basic
concepts where you can make yourself
stand out from most of the people that
do iphone development is to learn UI
patterns like design patterns learn MVC
learn how to keep your code clean learn
the different patterns and BVM different
ways you do it that's one thing that I
really recommend cuz that's something
that most the iOS community falls short
on we don't have a lot of people that
really understand how to keep software
running for a long period of time and
how to set up the patterns that allow
you to keep developing for a year two
years five years and still have a code
base that's viable so that's one way can
you can set yourself apart very cool now
what's the biggest I guess piece of
advice you'd give to a beginner that's
getting into development where would you
advise them to start always be learning
like in this industry you're you're
going to feel done a lot frequently no
matter how long you've been doing it
there's always me there's new things
coming out every day you're always going
to feel dumb and when someone talks
about some you don't know ask them about
it if you don't feel comfortable asking
about it go home and google it the
paradigms changed i had to work in and I
didn't know what other who were talking
about and I went when I heard sector I
didn't know I went home and I googled it
what is this and
as like that came back and I could at
least understand what the context was
the conversation and a lot of people get
here something that they don't know and
they think I don't belong here I don't
know everything you know that voice that
voice is a liar no one knows everything
the person who acts like he knows
everything is usually full of it so
always be learning if someone says
something you don't know that doesn't
mean you're you're dumb or you don't
belong here it just means you can learn
some more it's an opportunity to learn
now is the smart music app that you've
worked on is that part of sharp 5
software that was a separate client that
was something they brought me in and I
was on the on site for about a year full
time could you talk a little bit about
that what it does kind of what what it's
about smart music is an application for
band students violin students kids
taking private lessons and their teacher
can assign music and it will show them
the music on their iPad it'll listen to
what the students are playing if they're
playing the right notes and show that on
the screen so they can submit their
assignment to it features the teachers
sell them oh you got these rights yet
these was wrong so a teacher doesn't
have to sit and listen to every person
bring every student in true to listen to
play this piece and grade them they can
do it at their house everything's like
that so smart music as an application
has been around 20 years it's from a mid
90s though it's an education company had
them had a mac and windows components
but they were they wanted to be on the
iPad so good word of advice would be to
kind of whatever your your app is
whatever market is starting to try to
kind of get into that that mindset would
that be advice you would give it's
always good to have a understand
understanding of the people you're
writing software for have empathy so if
you understand the domain or like a type
of app or a type of industry that helps
but at the end of the day software
software that's true and
you know you were going to music camp
you might be working and music app and
being bored like we were kind of
something boring and have interesting
problems and you're solving them so
don't think that you have to build apps
for something that you really love
software it's a challenge regardless
what you're building so you got sharp
five software going and you also do a
weekly podcast with I freak they do that
hi freaks podcast and that's I get
together with three or four people and
will bring on a guest and let's ask
questions so we bring ons you know the
smartest people in the industry people
doing really cool things for iOS
development and it's asking questions
it's great to sit down with someone as
far as people industry and just asking
questions so I get a ton out of it just
by showing up and being person asked
questions now so and yeah our audience
just really they really respond to it so
it's so this week at all comp you're
talking about testing yep i'm talking
about unit testing okay so for somebody
that Maeby's never heard of unit testing
or never used it before why should they
use it yeah unit testing is a way to
verify that your code does what you want
to do and a lot of people think that's
kind of weird because you wrote the code
it obviously does what you want to do
but you test is a small piece of code
that verifies a different piece of code
does what is desires and people might
say now you have two pieces of code that
you have to maintain but it's a way to
verify that you didn't break something
so you have a feature working now and
you know in a month or two a week or two
you're going to add more functionality
but this is way to run something that's
automated that verifies that the new
changes didn't break something else so
it's a way of
setting up your app where you're
constantly verifying that you're not
breaking things and if you run a test
quickly if I know oh I broke something
we can fix it right away if you let it
sit for a couple weeks Senate to QA it
comes back then you're all sudden you're
out of the mindsets and it takes longer
to fix we tend to be more expensive so
it's a way to keep full quality high and
make sure your code is doing what you
want to do now at what point and the
development cycle should you start
working with unit testing should you do
it right from the get-go are just
towards the end what would your advice
be it depends if it's going to be a long
term project then definitely start from
the beginning start from the start and
they're going to see like place small
simple cases that you're testing but
after you add a bunch of new
functionality your app those become more
complex and you had more thing as you
change things get to do things around
about make sure that the basic stuff is
covered now for testing you I that's a
little you know soon as you start
talking testing that's a question that
comes up what would your advice be for
testing you I so I've had success with
teams that have used the UI automation
tools that have been around for a number
of years okay and there you write
JavaScript tests to actually click on
buttons and verify things showed and
there on the screen where you want to do
I've had success with that if you have
someone who wants to learn the UI UI
automation framework so that that works
and that's more higher level thinking on
buttons and verifying things you tested
just code so you're calling a function
on something verifying that the other
function did would it want to do
apple introduced the UI testing and I've
had very little luck getting anything
useful out of it hi don't to say it is
useless because I talked to one of the
speakers he's had good luck with it now
we had a student Leo who asked and
wanted me to ask you specifically how
would you go about testing local
notifications on a unit test level
that's just code that goes through the
app delegate and if you go to my talk
I'm going to talk a little bit about how
you can create an extension off that
delegates it's one of the tricks you can
do with Swift you can reimplement it and
verify that you're calling the code
correctly you're not going to verify
that the notation happened we can verify
that the code was called friendly can't
really unit test what the framework is
supposed to do that's kind of odd the
bounds can't test what you your code
does now I guess one thing they talked
about in the state of union that's a
little bit related to testing is the new
debugging features that have been in ad
added into Xcode or any of those did you
enjoy seeing any of that stuff I did
I've spent enough time debugging with
Swift I just want them to fix the stuff
that they already have debugging with
Swift is rough especially if you have a
large app that's objective c n swift so
people got really excited because it's
really cool functionality like the graph
of the object so you can find your
memory leaks to get a visual
representation of that I have no
confidence that it's gonna work for into
large apps I work on it work on for the
small things I hope they can help it if
once they get it working it's not gonna
be awesome thanks so much for being with
us here today Jamie I really appreciate
you sitting down talking with us yeah
that's great did a lot of fun you sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
