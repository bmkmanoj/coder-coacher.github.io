primitive that is very popular in
multi-threaded parallel programs and
extremely useful in developing
applications especially in the
scientific domain is what is called a
barrier synchronization the idea here is
that there are multiple threads and
they're doing some computation and they
want to get to a point where they want
to know where everybody else is at that
point of time and they won that assuring
that everybody has reached a particular
point in the respective computations so
that then they can all go forward from
from this barrier to the next phase of
the computation now I'm sure that you've
gone to dinners with your friends and
one of the experiences that you may have
had is that and you may have a party of
four or five people that are going for
dinner two or three of you are showing
up at the dinner restaurant and the
usher says wait you know do you have
their entire members of your party here
if they're not here wait till the other
members of the party show up so that I
can seat you all at the same time that's
the sort of same thing that's happening
with barrier synchronization it is
possible that you know threat t1 and t2
arrive at the barrier meaning that
they've completed their portion of the
work they've gotten to this barrier but
there are other threads that are lagging
behind and those shirkers are going to
eventually show up but they're not here
yet and until everybody shows up
nobody can advance to the next phase of
the computation so that's the idea
behind barrier synchronization exactly
similar to this analogy that I mentioned
to you so we looked at two types of
synchronization primitives one is the
lock and the other is the barrier
synchronization now these are concepts I
am expecting that you know already if
you find that these two concepts are
either new to you or you would like some
refresher for that I strongly advise you
to go and and take a look at the review
lesson that we have on multi-threaded
programming now that we understand the
basic synchronization primitives that
are needed for developing multi-threaded
applications on a shared memory machine
it's time now to look at how to
implement them but before we do that
let's do
a quiz to get you in the right frame of
mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
