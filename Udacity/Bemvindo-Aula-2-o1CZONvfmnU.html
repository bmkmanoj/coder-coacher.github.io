introduction to data science in the
first lesson we discussed data science
at a high level so we talked about the
skills that a data scientist usually has
and also some of the problems that you
can solve using data science one of the
most important skills that a data
scientist can have is the ability to
extract and clean data this is usually
referred to as data wrangling or data
munging believe it or not some data
scientists say that they can spend up to
70% of their time data wrangling this
might sound crazy to you but it's not
hard to imagine this happening let's say
you have some really cool analysis
project you want to do say look at a
variety of factors and figure out why
the life expectancy and City a is higher
than city B well okay let's say that all
this data lives on a website so you
write some scripts to go and pull this
data from the website great but then you
need somewhere to store the data so
you're going to need a database so oK
we've we use a database we store all the
data there and then you look at the data
and you realize oh wait there are a
bunch of missing values or a bunch of
this data looks weird so you need to
develop some some method to take all
this data and clean it up this is data
munging and all of this is necessary if
we want to answer our original really
cool question why is the life expectancy
in city a higher than the life
expectancy in City B in this lesson
we'll discuss data munging basics using
three data sets one containing
information on a bunch of baseball
players called the llama in baseball
database another containing information
on enrollments in an indian
identification program called Aadhaar
and also data from The Last FM API using
these three data sets we're going to
discuss the formats that data can come
in how you can acquire data from these
various data sources and also how to
inspect the data and see if it might
have any missing or erroneous values
alright well let's get started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
