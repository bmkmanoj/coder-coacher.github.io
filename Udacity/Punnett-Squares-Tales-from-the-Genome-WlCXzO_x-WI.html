segregate and all their possible
combinations for all the chromosomes and
then recombine in the offspring at
fertilization to produce all the
different genotypes and phenotypes we
can get is one of the most complicated
parts of genetics we're only scratching
the surface here at really understanding
what's going on in meiosis so there's a
handy way of thinking about how these
allele pairs separate using a tool
called a punnett square now some of you
may have heard of this before we're
going to take a quick look at how we can
use punnett squares to help us
understand this segregating alleles
problem a little better let's imagine
for a second that we have two parents a
mom and a dad these are two individuals
here and we're going to focus only on
chromosome 2 which has the lactase gene
controlling lactose intolerance dad is
homozygous recessive for lactase non
persistence this means the dad is going
to be lactose intolerant because he's
not going to make enough lactase as an
adult to be able to metabolize lactose
mom on the other hand is homozygous
dominant for lactase persistence this
means mom is going to be lactose
tolerant she's going to keep expressing
lactase into adulthood now the question
is if they have a child what are the
possible genotypes and phenotypes of
their children this is when our punnett
squares are going to come in handy let's
take the possible segregated allele
combinations we can have for the dad if
his pair of homozygous recessive allele
segregate we can get one gamete with a
recessive allele and another gamete with
a recessive allele now we can do the
same thing for the mom here she can
either pass on a dominant allele or
another dominant allele so if we want to
figure out what their offspring could be
Gina typically or what genotype they
will be all we have to do is fill in
this punnett square look at this box
combine the column in the road we can
have a plus and a minus here we can have
a plus and a minus here we can have a
plus and a minus here I mean have a plus
and a minus here it turns out that all
the possible combinations appear to be
the same so based on these results what
percentage of the children will be
lactose intolerant like the dad go ahead
and
put your answer in percentage form here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
