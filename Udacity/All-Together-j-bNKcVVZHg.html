condition for the permutation function
okay we'll say that X is a permutation
of Y if and only if one of the three any
any one of the three cases hold the
first case was that the the vector was
empty then it's a permutation or the
second case was if it's if it's not
empty and the first elements are the
same then it's a permutation if the
tails are the same and the third case
was it's not empty the first elements
don't match and there is some place in
the output vector Y where the first
element does occur we're going to call
that position J and it's then the case
that there's a permutation between the
tail of X and the results of pale ink
pasting together the segment before the
JT position with a segment that comes
after the J position please make sure
you understand this example is the
toughest bit of specification will we'll
see in these lessons and it's important
for you if you're going to be able to
express things precisely that you
understand how we approach this
particular problem I think that second
case was you said the first elements in
both x and y hold and then the remaining
tales of both x and y are permutations
of each other they're not the same as
each other like is okay so you got me
there and but one of the points we're
making with this is that same elements
as is the same thing as permutation okay
okay so I did state it incorrectly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
