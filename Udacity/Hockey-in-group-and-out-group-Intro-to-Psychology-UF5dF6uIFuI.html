don't like hockey well I'm here to be
that exception to the rule for your
stereotype because I love hockey
wait let me clarify that I am a Detroit
Red Wings fan that's right I have only
one team that I'm a favor of and that's
the Detroit Red Wings now when I was
living in Michigan in the Detroit area I
would run into other writings fans all
the time everywhere we went
somebody had on t-shirt they had on
their hats they had on their jerseys and
it was awesome but now that we're
talking about the Red Wings that's gonna
bring us to our next topic let me set
the scene throughout the years as a Red
Wings fan I've had the great opportunity
to watch my team when multiple Stanley
Cup championships and it's been awesome
and throughout those years we were also
seeing a few pesky teams that prevented
my team from moving forward in the
playoffs one of those teams was a San
Jose Sharks now I really had no opinion
of them other than that they were a team
that sometimes got in the way fast
forward a few years and I find myself
living in enemy territory with the San
Jose Sharks and their fans it turns out
unfortunately
that a lot of the fans don't like the
Red Wings or Red Wings fans now how do I
know that I know because I've
experienced firsthand what it's like to
be treated as an outsider I'll never
forget the time when I finished teaching
my general psychology course ran down to
my office and put on my wings gear and
went down to catch the bus to watch the
game I got on the bus and I realized I
was in a sea of teal all sharks fans and
immediately they all started booing me
some people had some off-color remarks
about my team and they were yelling me
go back to Detroit well I can tell you
from that experience it was obvious that
I was a part of the out-group and not a
part of the in-group as you can imagine
the bus ride was a little uncomfortable
there were a few people who were kind of
nice to me I think they felt badly
because I was getting picked on but for
the majority of the ride people were
booing me here's the interesting part
when I got to the arena I saw a lot of
Detroit Redwings fans they are wearing
their jerseys had their hats on and we
smiled at each other we high-five
wheeled go wings and here I had total
strangers but I felt a part of that
in-group and I did not feel a part of
the San Jose Sharks that would be the
out-group</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
