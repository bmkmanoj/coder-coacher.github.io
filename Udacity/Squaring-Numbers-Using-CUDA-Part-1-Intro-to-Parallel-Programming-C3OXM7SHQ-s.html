we're showing this in the class IDE
we're going to walk through it very
quickly and then run it in a shell
window and then we'll come back and look
at specific bits of the code so you're
sure you know what all of these calls do
then when we're done with that we're
going to ask you to make some changes
and run it yourself so this is the
actual class IDE I'm scrolling up and
down here is our main routine that's
we're going to run let me briefly go
through what we're looking at and then
I'll switch over to a show window and
show you how it actually runs so we're
going to start off by running code here
that's going to generate the input array
on the host then we will declare the GPU
memory pointers allocate the memory for
those pointers copy our host array over
to the device here's where the magic
happens this is where we actually launch
the kernel we then take the results here
and copy them back to the CPU and then
we print out the resulting array free
the memory and return 0 and if we go way
back up to the top here here's the
actual kernel that we're going to run
notice it's very simple
recall that we write a serial program
here and we know that all that program
is going to do it's square its input and
return it in the output now let's
actually run this code what we see here
is me connected to a CUDA capable
computer actually in our lab at UC Davis
we're going to first look at the code
itself just so you know I'm compiling
the real thing ok here's our program now
we're going to compile it and here's the
command to compile it the if you don't
have to worry about this in the class
IDE but I'm just showing you what this
looks like if you're running things on
your own computer what we see here is
instead of running the regular C
compiler we're running nvcc the Nvidia C
compiler yep what is going to go an
executable called Square and our input
file is squared Cu dot Cu is the
convention for how we name CUDA files
when we're saving them in a file system
ok so it completes pretty quickly and
then I'm going to run the program square
so what's square done it's taken our 64
element input array of the numbers 0 to
63 and it's squared each one of those
and printed out the output so we see 0 1
4 9 16 and so on all the way up to 63
squared now again you'll do this in the
class IDE and some
the later examples that we do in this
class will show how you do it in the
class IDE but just for now I'm showing
you the results of this program done in
a shell window so let's go back to our
code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
