mainly because as one person you can
fall sick you can become frail you can
run out of energy or steam or something
can get in your way as an obstacle and a
co-founder can help you overcome that
obstacle so where one is strong two are
powerful we're too or powerful three are
ultimate it also helps keep things
balanced it's good to have other
opinions that are not just your own i'm
not saying sole proprietorship doesn't
work it just requires that much more out
of you and sustainability can be a
challenge so having a co-founder is a
very good way to have somebody like
minded support the business in a similar
manner to you while bringing their own
strengths to the table so for me the key
advantage to having a co-founder is that
you get to share the load you both bring
your strengths to the table and you're
trading your strengths against the other
person's weaknesses and that makes for
very strong cohesive thing effectively
you're marrying this other person for
some period of time because you're both
very committed to what it is you're
trying to build</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
