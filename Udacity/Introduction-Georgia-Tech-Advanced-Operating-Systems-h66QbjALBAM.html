to remove an important pain point for
system developers namely system crashes
we know that system crashes can come
from software errors as well as from
power failure that brings up an
interesting thought experiment which is
what we're going to discuss next so how
does l rvm do it well it does it by
providing transactional semantics for
persistent data structures it calls
itself lightweight since it eliminates
all the usual heavyweight properties
associated with transactions which are
usually called acid properties and lr vm
makes transactions lightweight for use
precisely for the intended purpose which
is recovery management in lr vm changes
to virtual memory are written as redo
logs at the end of a transaction and
these zero logs are forced to the disk
at the end of the transaction as commit
records of changes made to virtual
memory and this log force that happens
at commit point is what is called a
synchronous i/o because the application
has to wait for the i/o to complete
before proceeding with further execution
so implementation a precise
implementation of the transactional
semantics of lr vm requires a log force
to the disk to make sure that the redo
log that represents all of the changes
made to virtual memory within that
critical section bound by a begin
transaction end transaction is actually
committed and persisted on the disk it
is precisely for this reason namely
synchronous i/o that transactions are
considered heavy weight even though the
semantics of transactions have been
considerably reduced and made simpler in
the design of lr p.m. in other words for
a precise implementation of lr vm at the
commit point it requires at least one
synchronous disk i/o system design tend
to avoid transaction despite the precise
semantics of transaction due to the time
penalty associated with this cayo if
this guy yo can be
eliminated then transactions would be
cheap and if transactions become cheap
and everyone will use it and life is
good Rio Vista the lesson that you're
going to review now asks the question
how can we eliminate synchronous disk
i/o so in other words Rio Vista is going
towards a performance conscious design
and implementation of persistent memory
starting from where L rvm left off</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
