is responsible for the open-source
Firefox web browser and it's also where
we'll find Brendan Eich the designer of
JavaScript let's go in and learn more
about that language so in this class we
handle only a very restricted subset of
JavaScript for example we don't pay very
much attention any attention to the
document object model one question
students might have is how useful it
really is to focus on a subset of
JavaScript or HTML can the skills that
will learn in making a lexer a parser
and interpreter for a smaller language
carry over to important tasks in the
real world Brendan yeah the answer is
yes in in Mozilla
working in other browsers and on the web
you often are dealing with a subset of
JavaScript there's even though not quite
subset let's say it's a subset called
JSON which is quite popular this way of
describing trees and data and it turns
out that you want to parse JSON very
quickly even when it's loaded as if it
were JavaScript you don't want it is
eval pass to the eval built-in in
JavaScript and so in our implementation
we actually do a very quick subset parse
if the stars in the moon are aligned for
JSON because that is such a common case
and if we can parse it as JSON which is
subset of JavaScript that's much more
efficient I also observed a lot of
JavaScript libraries almost all of them
with query in their name are doing sort
of compiled generated functions that are
optimized to match a certain query
against a document object model and so
there's cogeneration going on there's
some amount of partial evaluation going
on there's a subset of the language
being used to construct simple matches
and rules for matching trees</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
