quickly review the components of a
Markov decision process or mdp and see
how they are implemented using the
burlap library the first component of an
MDP is a set of states s that the system
can be in associated to each state s in
s is a set of actions a of s that can be
taken at the state little s additionally
there is a transition function t of SAS
prime that gives the probability that if
we are in state s and take action a that
we end up in state s Prime finally there
is a reward function R of s a s prime
which gives the reward we attained by
taking action a at state s and ending up
in state s Prime recall that it is
sometimes more natural to express the
reward as a function of just SNA or even
as a function of just the initial state
s we will use the most general form our
of SAS prime in this tutorial since
reward functions are implemented in
burlap in this manner a terminal state
is a state in which no further agent
action is possible after entering the
terminal state an agent receives no more
reward for the rest of time in lecture
we did not define terminal States as a
component of an MDP because they can be
considered states without any associated
actions however in burlap we will have
the capability to specially denote
terminal States so it is good to keep
this concept in mind as we build our mdp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
