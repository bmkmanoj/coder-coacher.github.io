if you've struggled the expression we
want is the quantity B divided by 2
squared for this first example our B was
equal to 6 so if we do 6 divided by 2
and square it we would get 9 and the
second case B was equal to 12 so 12
divided by 2 squared would be 6 squared
which is 36 the amount that we should
add and the third case we had be was
negative 4 so negative 4 divided by 2
equals negative 2 and then we square it
to get positive for notice that in each
case we always added a certain amount
this is because even if B is negative we
end up squaring this value so that way
it turns out positive to complete the
square will always add a positive amount
no matter if the B term is negative and
this also works for our last example the
D was negative 10 so we write that here
then we divide it by 2 which gives us
negative 5 and we square it to get
positive 25 this is the powerful of
expression that we need in order to
complete the square if you found the
expression and that's pretty amazing
again this is a really hard pattern to
find and generate on your own let's see
how we can use this to solve some
quadratic equations by completing the
square</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
