you how to use variables and constants
in a playground I've gone ahead and
opened this empty playground and we'll
get started by declaring some variables
we know to create a variable that we
need to use something like the following
syntax we have the keyword var then some
name for the variable and its value for
example I'll create this variable called
my jersey number with the value of 5
this creates or declares a variable with
the name my jersey number and when we
write this code swift works behind the
scenes and infers that my jersey numbers
type is an integer because 5 is an
integer and we can check this if we hold
down the option key and go up to the
variable name and we click it we can see
that it's been declared as an int value
when swift automatically infers the type
of the variable in this case to nth we
call this inferred typing so let's do
another example so we will create this
variable called my cool variable and
give it a value of a and double quotes
so if you've created a variable like
this before where you use the double
quotes you may already know what Swift
may infer this to be but we can check
and it looks like Swift has interpreted
this as a string variable so Michael
variable contains a string and that
makes sense that's what this is double
quotes main that means a string but this
string is just one character what if we
wanted the variable to be of character
type because it represents a single
character instead of a string type which
can represent multiple characters is
there a way that we can help Swift do
this actually there is and here's how
we'll modify our variable declaration
and add a colon after the name and then
specify the type that we won't so this
is a slightly different syntax than we
saw before but it removes the need for
swift to guess the variables type
because we're explicitly stating it in
this case we want it to be a character
and when we take the guesswork out of
typing for swift we call this explicit
typing and if I use the option click we
can see that this is now a character and
no longer a string in general Swift
a great job at inferring the types of
our variables so explicit typing is
usually not necessary however in some
cases like this one you want to use
explicit typing so that the compiler
knows exactly what type you intend for
the variable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
