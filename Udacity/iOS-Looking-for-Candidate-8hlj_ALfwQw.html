or just about any junior developer there
are basically two things that I'm
looking for i'm looking for a solid
foundation and also passion with a solid
foundation I mean that I'm not looking
for quantity of knowledge but quality I
will never ask questions about a very
specific detail on some framework that
doesn't give me the information that I'm
looking for I want to make sure that any
code that he brings to our existing a
code base will work will be reusable by
the team and won't break anything so I
will try to Center on questions that
show if he has a solid foundation on the
basics of iOS development for example I
will always ask the candidate if she
understands the Model View and
controller how they relate to each other
and what are the main responsibilities
of each of these teams a common mistake
that many beginners make is not using
the right method to send information
from one object to the other I'm talking
about things like the delegate
notifications and target action for
example so that's something that I
always ask if he has an understanding of
notifications when you should use
notifications and when you should use a
delegate instead that's a common mistake
so this is a sort of a quality of
knowledge that I'm looking for another
question that I will try to ask is try
to find out if he's passionate about
what he's doing it's a vital that this
is not just a job it must be your hobby
too so a few years ago there was a
accident in New York where the pilot of
the plane managed to do unpowered
landing on the Hudson River and a few
days later his resume became
public and it was very obvious why this
pilot was a great hire for US Airways
his job was piloting an Airbus and his
hobby was piloting a Cessna so he was a
total nerd about flying this is the kind
of people that you need to find if the
the candidate shows that her hobby is
also programming that's a higher so I'll
try to find that by asking if she has
any github profile that's a must any
side projects that he or she is working
on by himself and contributions to open
source software that sort of thing that
shows that he's really really passionate
about coding so that's what I'm really
looking for in a junior iOS developer or
just about any junior developer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
