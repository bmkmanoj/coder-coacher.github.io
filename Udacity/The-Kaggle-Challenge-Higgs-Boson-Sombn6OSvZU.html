separate data sets sound overly
complicated let's look at this in action
in the real world cattle is a
computation platform for machine
learning people compete on
classification tasks and whoever gets
the highest performance wins here I'm
showing the example of a scientific
competition on data that relates to the
Higgs boson Kaggle also has three data
sets the training data the public
validation data sets and a private test
set that is not revealed to the
competitors here Kaggle shows you the
performance of the top competitors when
measured on the private test sets the
green and red arrows show how different
their ranking was compared to the
ranking on the public sets let's look at
the rankings the top competitors were
doing well on the public validation data
and they remained at the top once the
private data was revealed if you go
further down the leaderboard however
it's a real blood shell many competitors
who thought they were doing well we're
not doing well at all on the private
data set as a result their ranks went
down dramatically once the private data
set was revealed why is that maybe they
had a good model that did well in
validation just by chance what's more
likely however is that by evaluating
themselves over and over dozens of time
on the validation set they ended up
overfitting to the validation set and
failing to generalize the few top
competitors however at good experimental
design there were not misled into
thinking that they were doing well they
probably took out some of the training
set to validate their algorithm or use
more sophisticated methods like
cross-validation and didn't make many
decisions based on the public data set
