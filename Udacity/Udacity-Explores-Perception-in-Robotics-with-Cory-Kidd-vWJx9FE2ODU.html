human robot interaction and why it's
important in robotics sure so I mean
human robot interaction as a field is
pretty broadly defined you know you've
got robots and people interacting with
one another in terms of like academic
tradition it comes down the field mostly
of human-computer interaction which in
turn comes from psychology so for me and
a lot of the work I've done over the
last 15 16 years in human robot
interaction a lot of that comes back to
how do we as people interact with one
another and what of that can we apply in
the world of technology this particular
technology typically takes a form that
can look at us maybe talk to us maybe
roam around in our spaces so why do you
feel that that's important that we have
a technology that can kind of interact
with us and kind of work closely with us
and building that bond between that
technology I think it really depends on
the application right obviously you know
as humans we've built technology for a
very long time right it's something that
that we do and you've got a lot of
technology now that is getting more and
more complex and doing things in the
same physical spaces as us right so part
of that name stuffs moving around around
us many of these take the form of robots
or some other automation right so the
word robot robot is not necessarily very
clearly defined and so we could think
about a lot of things that we interact
with today or that we imagine that we're
going to be interacting in the next few
years they're going to share space with
us and we need to know what that means
right when this stuff is you know in our
environment and our offices in our homes
in other places where we're going to
interact with it understanding how
that's going to work so this technology
is to our benefit and not our detriment
it's very important right so that's a
very broad thing very deliberately in
terms of you know how we think about
this the kinds of things that we're
building but I think that's a lot of
what human robot interaction as a field
of study is about right understanding
how do we solve these problems in a way
that benefit us as humans in terms of
using this technology what kind of
studies are you aware of that have kind
of taken place in this area that really
kind of started to drive this movement
but we're kind of like a focal point
that people started saying hey we really
need to kind of you know focus a lot
more on this aspect of how people
interface with machines and not
necessarily just that the machine is
here and it's going to do a job and we
really don't
care about how I been socially right so
I mean there are thousands of studies in
human robot interaction that have been
done over the last two decades and that
really builds on the field of
human-computer interaction where you've
got many many more studies going back
for about a half a century now probably
even longer so you know it's a field
that people have thought about for a
long time and it has a lot of different
aspects to these studies some of them
are are you know very broad and trying
to understand you know you put robots
into a particular environment how do
people interact or react some of them
are very specific alright so getting
down to some of the details you know we
have a mobile robot say that can move
around how close can it come to you and
you're still comfortable right so very
similar to you know interpersonal space
we're a few feet apart right now all
right this would be a bit different if
we were going right up close the next to
one another right new you so you start
to feel awkward when I didn't give in to
your face same kind of thing with robot
check is it the same as with us right is
you know six inches too close with a
robot definitely as if you know we were
talking six inches apart three feet so
this feels about right is it the same
with the robot so you've got a whole
range of things and you can imagine all
different aspects of interpersonal
interaction right with other people how
do we apply those in the world of
technology specifically in the world of
robotics so there's this whole body of
literature again looking at the very
broad things right robots in particular
situations or how do they help us in
education or healthcare or entertainment
do the very specific you know if a robot
does this particular action or says this
thing or you know makes this sound or
write these very specific pieces there
are a lot of studies around that as well
now doesn't mean that the field is done
right there's so much more that we have
to understand for a couple of reasons
one is there are perhaps an infinite
number of those types of questions that
we can answer right we can keep thinking
of new one but also the technology is
evolving if we look at what an
interactive robot or social robot is
today versus what it was five years ago
or ten years ago or 20 years ago the
technology is very different its
capabilities of different as we continue
to develop new things whether that be
the technology or the use cases for it
then we need to keep exploring these
interactions and again going back to how
do we make this technology in a way that
benefits
as people and the users of it so looking
at some of the studies that have been
done right from a psychological
standpoint how would you conduct one of
those types of studies like what would
you find that would be useful
information so for instance I know you
got close to my face a few seconds
together like this is make you a great
way to do it right and you know for some
people it does for me personally I have
a very small bubble I thought it looked
so but in those situations though right
there's generally a distance that people
typically like to hold a lot of its
cultural some of its social right well
it's just personal but how would you go
about setting up one of these studies
what kind of studies like these are
typically conducted when you're trying
to do some sort of research for human
robot interaction were you trying to say
well a robot four feet away is okay
robot two feet away
not so much or robot it's two feet away
that's six feet all I really don't like
but if it's only half a foot tall it
doesn't really bother me a whole lot
sure so I mean some of those questions
are very specific right you could
imagine how to design a study and you
know any particular study needs a design
that's appropriate for it but as a rule
of thumb again I'd go back to psychology
so when I was starting off doing my
master's degree at the MIT Media Lab 16
years ago one of my mentors was the late
cliff Nath of Stanford and cliff semi
jokingly would talk about his research
methodology as this he'd say so cliff
was an expert in human-computer
interaction right later went on to do
some work in robotics but he would say
you know go into the psychology section
of the library and find a paper with a
great study about two people interacting
with one another and I would take one of
those people cross it out put computer
and stealing
and so he ended up publishing as a
problem possibly hundreds of studies
right a lot of different studies of
human-computer interaction now he was
very clever than about how he translated
those into the world with people
interacting with technology but in
general that's a great technique so some
of those early studies that I was doing
you know more than a decade a half ago
cliff and I designed together right
really using that kind of methodology
okay if there's this kind of a problem
that you want to solve or this kind of a
thing you want to learn again it's a
great precedent and how do we as people
interact with one another
let's go borrow from that right let's
learn what
we've already used in you know academic
or research settings to understand how
people are interacting with one another
and understand how we apply that with
technology and so it's a great way to
think about that right again what we're
building in terms of the technology is
very new what we're creating in terms of
the interactions of not all right we
really want to leverage what we as
people already innately or naturally
know what to do and how to do with other
people but understand where the
technology fits into that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
