that are in the form y equals MX plus B
and we've talked about how m here
represents the slope of this line and B
is the y coordinate of the y-intercept
the place where the graph intersects the
y-axis when we write an equation in this
form we say that it is written in
slope-intercept form since as we've seen
this lets us just read off the values of
the slope and the y-intercept understand
the rule that each of these constants
play in this equation in its graph can
help us get to the stage of graphing a
lot quicker let's see if we can figure
out how to graph the equation y equals
negative 2x Plus 10 without creating an
XY table first let's just move straight
to the graph of course we have to start
by setting up our x and y axes notice
here that the scale on either axis is
different horizontally we're counting by
ones with each grid but vertically we're
counting by fours I just want to make
sure we have enough room to show as much
of this line as I want to one pretty
easy way for us to start out would be by
filling in a point that we can find out
super easily so please begin by telling
me where the y intercept of this
equation is please don't forget that the
y intercept is actually a point a set of
coordinates not just one number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
