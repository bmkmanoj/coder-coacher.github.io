three ways to build up the chart one is
by calling the closure or predicting the
next is by shifting and the third is by
performing reductions I'm going to have
you do all three and this is the second
one shifting let's say we're currently
looking at charts uh by and there's a
state in there X goes to a B dot CD from
Jay and this time we're going to look at
the input tokens and they're in a list
call just tokens so I'm going to have
the following code in our parser
framework we're going to figure out if
there's a candidate next state by
calling a special procedure shift and
shift gets to see the tokens the entire
input which token we're on also which
chart state we're on X ABCD and J the
current state we're considering and
based on that there may either be a
possible shift or there might not be so
shift will either return won't none at
which point there's nothing to do or it
will return a single new parsing state
that presumably involved shifting over
the c if c matched up with the I token
so then we'd add that to the chart in
position I plus 1 the correct place and
we'll keep track of whether there have
been any changes you should write shift</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
