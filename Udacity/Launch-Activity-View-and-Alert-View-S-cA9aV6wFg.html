activity view in order to enable users
to share memes let's go back into our
experiment app and see about presenting
the activity view controller well start
out with just an empty image object we
can then use that image to instantiate a
UI activity view controller and then we
just present it let's see how that
worked and there's our activity view one
can make an alert view in a similar way
here we're just constructing our alert
view controller and presenting it and
then we'll try and run it and then we'll
try and present our alert view
controller oh okay so let's scroll up to
the top of the console to see what's
going on you i alert controller must
have a title and message or an action to
display okay so if we add one of those
this should fix the air so we'll try
that let's close the console up and then
we'll return to our view controller and
close that too so here we're adding a
title and a message to our alert view
controller so let's see if that fixes
the problem alright show me an alert
view a sweet ok now we're successfully
presenting our alert view controller but
right now there's no way to make it go
away remember that anytime you present
of you you also need to provide the user
with a way to dismiss it the first two
view controllers we presented had their
own cancel buttons built-in but alert
view doesn't have that so we have to
solve the problem ourselves we could
just try adding this dismiss view
controller method right after present
view controller let's see what that does
ok show me an alert view up well it
showed me an alert view but then the
alert view immediately left which is not
that surprising since we called dismiss
view controller immediately after we
called present view controller what we
really want is for the alert view to be
dismissed after the user has taken some
action like clicking an ok button alert
view has an interesting way to do this
with closures as you know closures like
this one enable us to pass methods
around as arguments so let's see how
that looks
okay our alert view appears i click OK
and it goes away perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
