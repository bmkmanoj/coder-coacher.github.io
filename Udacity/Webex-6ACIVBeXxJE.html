hours and teleconferences in the OMS
program some classes use hangouts
hangouts on air and other tools but
WebEx comes most highly recommended
because it supports both one-to-one and
one-to-many meetings and because it
supports client-side recording of
meetings to access WebEx go-to-guy tech
web XCOM click on the top right to log
in to host a teleconference click this
button then send your guests this link
the first time you use the tool you'll
go through some initial setup based on
your operating system then once you're
in you'll need to click connect to audio
over here to enable audio after that you
can click on your microphone to mute or
unmute yourself you can click this icon
to turn on your webcam you can also
invite people and get the meeting URL
using these buttons or you can enable
screen sharing with this button lastly
you can use the record button to record
the meeting as the presenter you have a
number of options for how to control the
room more commonly though you'll be
joining rooms run by your instructors
and TAS so let's see what that's like
I'm going to join David's room I'd click
the link to his meeting that he sent me
then I click into room the same way I
did before after joining I would need to
enable my audio by either clicking yes
when prompted or by clicking connect to
audio if these options don't appear the
presenter hasn't yet enable audio after
that I'll be in the same type of room
but since I'm not the presenter most of
the options will be disabled but I'll
still mute and unmute myself or turn on
and off my webcam the same way these
WebEx rooms are only open if the
presenter is in them but if you join
them before the presenter arrives you'll
be automatically put in the conference
once they're there typically your
instructors and TAS will schedule office
hours and when office hours roll around
you can just click the link to enter
their room and wait for them to arrive
WebEx also supports a waiting room of
sorts in case the instructor or TA wants
to have private one-on-one office
hours with a series of people if that's
the case you'll automatically be put
into the conference once the instructor
or TA is ready for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
