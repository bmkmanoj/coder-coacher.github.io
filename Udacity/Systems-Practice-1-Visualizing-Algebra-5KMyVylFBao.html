going to let d equal the number of Dimes
and Q equal the number of quarters the
question indicates the variables that we
need to use in this case we need to know
how many of each coin we have so we need
two variables D and Q we need to set up
two equations one will involve the
number of coins and the other will
involve the value of the coins we know
the number of Dimes plus the number of
quarters has to equal our total number
of coins our register only contains
dimes and quarters and it has a total
number of 21 coins so if we add the
number of Dimes d to the number of
quarters Q we get 21 here the variables
are taking the place of the numbers we
don't know the number of Dimes so we use
D and we don't know the number of
quarters so we use Q we know the total
value of the coins is two dollars and
seventy cents a dime is worth ten cents
so to get the value of dimes we multiply
ten cents by the number of Dimes we have
a quarter on the other hand is worth 25
cents so to get the value of the
quarters we multiply 25 cents times our
number of quarters q and if we add these
two values together we should get two
dollars and seventy cents I've rewritten
the two equations down here and now we
can use either substitution or
elimination to solve this problem i'm
going to use substitution since i can
easily solve for one of the variables in
this first equation if we subtract cue
from both sides of this equation will
get d is equal to 21 minus q now that we
have d salt for we can perform
substitution and plug in 21 minus Q and
4d in our second equation next I'd it
should be one-tenth to 21 and negative Q
I combine like terms next I subtract two
and one tenth from both sides and
finally i divide both sides by 1500s and
we get q is equal to 4 q stood for the
number of quarters so we have four
quarters but I still need to find the
number of Dimes I can use my first
equation and plug in 4 for Q to find the
number of Dimes d solving for d i get d
is equal to 17 so we have four quarters
in a register and 17 dimes let's go back
to our original problem and make sure
that this makes sense we said we had 17
dimes and four quarters well the total
number of corn should be 21 and yes
those two add up to 21 so we know this
first equation
is true one dime is worth ten cents so
17 dimes would be worth a dollar and
seventy cents one quarter is worth
twenty-five cents so four quarters would
be worth one dollar and with simple
addition we know that a dollar seventy
and one dollar add up to two dollars and
seventy cents so the second equation is
true as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
