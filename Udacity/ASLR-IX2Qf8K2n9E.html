next one we're going to talk about is
widely used a number of operating
systems now and so one thing that's
going to be different about the next two
techniques we talked about is that
they're going to use support from the
operating systems less hardware that we
have to deal with buffer overflow to
thwart buffer overflow attacks so the
first one as which I said many operating
systems use is what is called address
space layout randomization
aslr so remember in an address space you
know some place stack is space for stack
is allocated so stack start certain
place somewhere the library code goes
another place where the heap goes and so
on what if we randomize the places where
these areas of memory start remember
that hacker had to actually guess where
key information is so if I wanted rule
Lib C return to Lib C attack I had to
know where the library is where a
certain function may be so I I know the
address of that function and I can use
that as I overflow the return address
field in the stack frame so I need to
know these addresses and what SLR does
it makes hard because of the
randomization that we do it makes hard
for that hacker to find these important
locations where the address that that
hacker is interested in is going to or
where the information address of the
information that that hacker is
interested in is not known so as I said
number of operating systems these days
actually do that to protect programs of
processes from these buffer overflow
kind of attacks so this is just make it
harder for that hacker to successfully
craft an attack where can return or can
manage or direct control of the program
to a certain known place that could be
used to let the attacker execute
arbitrary code there's one other defense
against stack buffer overflows when the
shell code itself is stored on the stack
so remember if I don't do return to Lib
C then my return address has to point me
to some place where the shell code lives
or is stored and
you could write that shellcode and do
some area of the stack itself and then
you can execute off the stack there is
no legitimate reason for us to execute
instructions that are stored on the
stack so one thing we can do is we can
make the stack non-executable basically
says the system is not going to allow
you to fetch instructions from the stack
area or the stack segment if you do that
then you can't execute on the stack so
your shellcode cannot be on the stack
you are to find some other place to put
your shellcode and maybe that's why you
have to try tricks like return to Lib C
and things like that and use a library
function to transfer control to the code
that hacker wants executed so here I
guess we talked about sort of security
is increasing assurance making the
attackers job more difficult and making
the legitimate in this case here we're
talking programmers their tasks somewhat
easier so SLR obviously is making that
hackers job more difficult because key
addresses that they need to know they
don't know exactly where they are in the
address space and they can't put code on
the stack and hope to get it executed
because we have the hardware operating
system says not supposed to fetch
instructions from the stack area of the
address space so these are techniques
for actually dealing with buffer
overflows as we said one makes it harder
for that hacker by make it difficult for
them to find the right addresses or be
able to use the stack for shellcode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
