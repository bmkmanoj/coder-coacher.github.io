is cool enough but it's pretty useless
if you don't know how to access the
application and make requests to that
server it's running it's waiting for
someone anyone to reach out and start
talking to it the most common way of
making a request to a server is through
the web browser so let's try that so
what's the URL that I need to type in to
access our Sinatra app what address do
we visit did you notice this line in the
terminal output we got when we started
up our server Sinatra V one point four
point seven has taken the stage on four
five six seven for development what is
this four five six seven it's referring
to well before we go any further there
are two key terms we need to define
local host and port our Sinatra app is
running on localhost which put simply
means that the app is running on this
computer my computer I can access it
from this computer but it's not
accessible to any other machine right
now and most development work is done
locally on developers own computers
before apps are deployed to production
servers where everyone else can access
them so that's the local host part what
about port well put simply ports are
specific entry points into a host like
local host on our local host we can have
multiple web apps running at the same
time each on a different port in our
case the Sinatra app is running on port
4 5 6 7 as the terminal output told us
but we could also have another app
running at the same time on port 3000 or
maybe port 8080 so we've made it through
the tedious term defining section it's
time to put those two ideas together
local host and port so to browse an app
running on localhost all you need to do
is visit this URL localhost colon and a
port number in our case we want to visit
local host 4 5 6 7 make sure your server
is still running in your terminal and if
it's not just restart it with Ruby app
dot RB and then switch over to your
brows
and visit localhost colon four five six
seven and that's it you made your first
request to our Sinatra app you should
see the application home page and you
can now click around and view the
different pages of the app so we have
our home page here but there's also a
lovely about page that you can peruse it
says this is the about page and yes it
has a different icon here it's not much
functionality wise but that's not the
point what's important is that you're
making a request and viewing your first
Sinatra app running on localhost
remember that this app is only
accessible on your computer for now
because it's running on localhost if you
revisit your terminal you'll see some
new output that's actually triggered by
the request that we made to localhost
four five six seven every time a new
request is made we get some new terminal
output detailing the information about
that request also remember that this app
is only accessible on your own computer
for now because it's running on
localhost and if you try shutting off
your server with ctrl C or ctrl D and
then you try and request localhost four
five six seven again oh no the app is
gone the site can no longer be reached
because our server is no longer running
there's nothing to requests anymore but
don't worry you can restart the server
and resume making requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
