mitochondrial chromosome the snv's we
can trace my maternal line exactly you
got your mitochondrial DNA from your
mother she got it from her mother and
she got it from her mother and so on and
so let's go take a look at your
mitochondrial DNA okay all right and
what I'd like to do now is focus on the
maternal lines so let's go back up to
the menu my results under ancestry
overview we see maternal line which is
what we've been talking about and then
oh wow so I have my maternal line from J
to a1a and what does that mean exactly
so if you remember when we looked at the
rest of your chromosomes they indicated
a lot of ancestry from Britain and
Ireland and j2 is a lineage it's also
very common in Europe different parts of
Europe and it's a lineage that arrived
in Europe maybe 45 thousand years ago so
that's something that you inherited from
your mother so if you were to trace back
you know and get to know who your
relatives were through your maternal
line you'd find that they all they
probably were living in Europe different
parts of Europe and maybe if you went
far enough back if you went back 45,000
years you'd probably find that they were
on the Arabian Peninsula in the near
East and if you went to went even
further back you'd find that they were
in Africa because if we all of us when
we trace our ancestry a single lineage
of our necessity far enough back will
find that it traces to Africa now
interestingly I actually have my own
father is um I'm the 23 me uh-huh okay
group 2 and I notice it he and I have
the same mitochondrial subgroup now does
that mean we're related that means that
you have a common maternal ancestor and
it could be back in thousands of years I
see yeah but that's kind of cool you
know to share that maternal ancestry
it's not but you did not inherit it from
him but both of you have a maternal
ancestor if you go back far enough the
same maternal ancestor know what about
Roy king who we looked about earlier
okay um let's find so Roy has
a lineage called el to see and that
lineage is very common in western Africa
and if we recall Roy's overall ancestry
from chromosomes 12 22 about half of it
traced back to Africa but what we see by
looking at his maternal line is that
specifically if he goes back the mothers
you know his mother's mother's mother's
mother's mother came from Africa and I'd
like to do is compare that with his
paternal line when we want to get a
chance okay okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
