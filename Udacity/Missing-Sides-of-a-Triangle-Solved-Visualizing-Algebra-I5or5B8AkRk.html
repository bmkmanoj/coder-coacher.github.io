20 and the shorter leg is 15 units great
work for finding those three numbers for
a squared will have X minus 5 squared
for B squared will have x squared and 4c
squared we'll have the quantity X plus 5
squared keep in mind a and B are the
legs and see is a hypotenuse now we have
one equation with one variable which
means we can solve squaring the quantity
X minus 5 we get x squared minus 10x
plus 25 and squaring the quantity X plus
5 squared we get x squared plus 10x plus
25 this x squared it just comes straight
down here next we'll add like terms on
the left-hand side of our equation to
get 2x squared minus 10x plus 25 the
right hand side of our equation stays
the same and since we have a quadratic
equation we want to move all of these
terms to the left hand side so we get a
quadratic expression set equal to 0 we
move each of these terms to the other
side of the equation by subtracting the
appropriate amount will subtract x
squared subtract 10 X and subtract 25
from both sides of the equation we do
this so that way the x squared term
remains positive and then we can factor
this leaves us with x squared minus 20 x
equals 0 we can factor an ex from these
two terms since it's the greatest common
factor so all of x times the quantity X
minus 20 we set each factor equal to 0
and then we solve for x x can equal 0 or
X can equal positive 20 since we know
we're talking about the side length the
longer leg must be 20 the 0 doesn't
really make sense in this case so our
longer leg will be 20 alright potenuse
will be five more which is 25 and our
shorter leg will be five less which is
15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
