wise you should probably be able to
guess this even if you don't understand
why the answer is this but let me
explain why so what we'd like to show is
that if we're given a function f of n
that is in big theta of G of n that we
can turn that around and also infer that
that means G of n is in big theta of F
of n so the way we're going to show this
is to go back to the definition of big
theta so here's the definition that
there's some constant C 1 and C 2 bigger
than 0 and an N 0 threshold and 0 such
that F of n lies between C 1 of G of N
and C 2 of G of n for all and bigger
than the threshold and 0 we can infer
from this that by dividing through this
equation dividing through by C 1 which
is a positive number we get a new set of
inequalities like so where G of n is now
sandwiched between 1 over C 1 of F of N
and 0 we can do that same trick again
dividing through this equation by C 2
and we see that 1 over C 2 of F of n is
less than equal to G of n so we can
combine these two facts to show that G
of n is sandwiched between 1 over C 2 of
F of N and 1 over C 1 of FN like so now
notice that this 1 over C 2 and 1 over C
1 those are just constants so it's
equivalent to say that this 1 over C 2
is just a constant we can rename at C 1
and this 1 over C 1 is just a constant
we can rename it C 2 and this is exactly
the definition of big data so we can
infer from this that G of n is in big
data of F event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
