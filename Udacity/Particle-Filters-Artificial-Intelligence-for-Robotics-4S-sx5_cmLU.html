the subject of today's class and it's
really interesting to see the answers
for particle filters first the state
space of particle filters is usually
continuous so we can deal them with a
more interesting version of state spaces
but we not confined to unimodal
distributions we can actually represent
arbitrarily multimodal distributions
they are also approximate just like the
other two filters and in terms of
efficiency the word is still out there
in certain incarnations they're clearly
scale exponentially and is a mistake to
represent the particle filters of
anything more than say four dimensions
but in other domains mostly in tracking
domains they tend to scare much much
better and I've not seen a good
treatment yet of the complexity in
practice for particle filters however
the key advantage of particle filters is
actually none of those things over here
the key advantage at least in my life
has been they're really easy to program
as you hopefully see today riding a
particle filter is really really easy in
fact you will write your own particle
filter for a continuous valued
localization problem which is in many
ways more difficult than any of the
problems we talked about before so let's
dive in and see a particle filter in
action so here is a floor plan of an
environment where robot is located and
it has to perform what's called global
localization which is it has no clue
where is and has to find out where it is
just based on sensor measurements this
robot has range sensors as indicated by
the blue stripes those use sonar sensors
which means sound to arrange the
distance of nearby obstacles and it has
to use these range sensors to determine
a good posterior distribution as to
where it is but the moment doesn't know
it's it's starting in the middle of the
corridor in fact it is completely
uncertain as to where it is now the
particle filter represents us using
particles each of these red dots of
which there are several thousand here is
a discrete guess whether what might be
it struck
as an x-coordinate Y coordinates and
also a heading direction and these three
values together comprise a single guess
but a single guess is not a filter it is
the set of several thousands of such
guesses that together comprise an
approximate representation for the
posterior of the robot so let's start
the video in the beginning the particles
are all uniformly spread but the
particle filter makes them survive in
proportion of how consists in running
these particles is with the sensor
measurement verily the robot has figure
outs in the corridor
but two clouds survive because of the
symmetry of the corridor as the robot
then enters one of the officers the
symmetry is broken and the correct set
of particles survive let me play this
again the essence of particle filters is
to have these particles guess where the
robot might be moving but also have them
survive using effectively survival of
the fittest
so that particles that are more
consistent with the measurements are
more likely to survive and as a result
places of high probability will collect
more particles and therefore be more
representative of the robots procedure
belief those particles together those
thousands of particles are no cluster at
a single location
those comprise the approximate belief of
the robot as it localizes itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
