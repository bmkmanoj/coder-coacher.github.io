the inverse function first we switch the
values of X&amp;amp;Y and then we solve for y
and replace that with F inverse of X now
there is a quicker way to find the
inverse of a linear function I could
just list out what I did to X first I
multiply X by 2 and then I took that
result and I added 3 so to undo these
operations I will want to start with the
result and do the inverse of this step
so I start with the result which is x
and i'm going to subtract 3 first then
i'll take that result and divide it by 2
notice that to find the inverse function
we first undo the last step that we
performed for f of x then we work
backwards and undo each of the steps
before we can see this for an input like
x equals 1 will multiply the input by 2
which equals 2 and then we'll add 3 to
that result which equals positive 5 so
if this is a true inverse function if i
put in positive 5 i should get out the
original input which was one so notice
will take five use that for the input of
our inverse function and first we'll
subtract 3 which equals 2 next we'll
divide that result by 2 so 2 divided by
2 equals 1 so notice how our inverse
function undoes the operations that was
performed on one our original function
with an input at one gave us an output
of 5 and then our inverse function with
an input of 5 gave us our original input
which was one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
