exponents so we have 3 to the 2 minus 4
or 3 to the negative 2 this negative
exponent moves the base of 3 to the
denominator with a power of 2 so we'll
have 1 over 3 squared or 1 9th here i'll
subtract the exponents again f to the
5-8 or at to the negative 3 we know this
F will be move to the denominator with a
positive power so 1 over F cubed in both
this first example and the second
example you want to think where did you
have the higher exponent it was in the
denominator the 3 to the 4th have the
higher exponent than 3 squared and after
the 8th had a larger exponent than after
the fifth if we look at expanded form we
can see that the 3s will simplify and
we're left with three of the twos in the
denominator or one ninth the same is
true with the f's five of the f's
simplify to 1 and then we're left with F
cubed in the denominator this should
make sense I have more f's in the
denominator than I do in the numerator
we use a similar reasoning to figure out
the last one we should have five more
double use in the denominator than the
numerator so I know a w-2 the fifth is
in my denominator now I need to figure
out the other two numbers aight divides
into 16 and 40 so i'd be left with two
fifths so i have 2/5 times w to the
fifth there's my last fraction I hope
you found a lot of different ways to
make sense of these exponents there's no
one way or wrong way to figure them out
you can apply the properties of power or
look at the expanded forms to get your
answers just be sure that it's making
sense along the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
