same thing as 4 and one-third rooms to
solve this i first found a rate which is
the rate that Taylor and grant can paint
a room which is two rooms in three hours
and I set that equivalent to another
rate which is X rooms in seven hours X
because we don't know how many rooms
they can paint in seven hours again
notice that the numerators have the same
units they're both the number of rooms
and the denominators have the same units
as well they both are a number of hours
next we cross multiply so i'll multiply
two rooms by seven hours and I'll set
that equivalent to three hours times X
rooms 2 times 7 is 14 and that's
equivalent to three times x divide both
sides by 3 cross out the 3 in the
numerator and the denominator here and
we're left with x equals 14 thirds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
