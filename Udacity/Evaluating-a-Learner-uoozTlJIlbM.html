one last thing I want to talk about we
just talked about evaluating a policy
but remember in the reinforcement
learning setting the policy is what gets
output as a result of the learning
process so what if we want to actually
evaluate the learner how good is this
learner do you can you think of some
ways that we might be able to decide how
good a learner is sure it's as good as
its policy so that seems like a good
idea that a good learner is one that
returns a good policy sure what if we
have two learners that return the same
policy say the optimal policy oh okay
well I can think of two responses that
one is who cares they're both the same
and the only thing that matters is how
could the policy is that you come up
with or I can come up with another
answer which would be I will take the
one that does it more quickly quickly in
terms of what let's say time I think
that I think that's what quickly means
yes but like time of what there's lots
of different kinds of time that matter
so one is one in particular is
computation time yeah wall clock time
and that seems like an important one
right we want one that's going to be
more efficient in terms of the
computations that it does in the process
of learning the policy but there's
another kind of time that actually
matters a lot in the reinforcement
learning setting so I think it's worth
mentioning okay so the other kind of
complexity that turns out to be really
important in this learning setting is
experience complexity do you have a
sense of what that might mean how
complex your experiences are no okay
well okay again it's a computational
complexity sort of how much
computational energy you have to put
into it so this would be how much
experience you have to have in order to
learn so it's a like the amount of data
that you need so if two different
learners can learn the same optimal
policy but one only requires a couple
interactions with the environment to do
it and the other one requires a billion
you know the one that has the lower
experience complexity should be
preferred though of course there's
trade-offs I mean if it to do that it
actually has to compute for two billion
years then that seems maybe not so good
either so there's there can be the
little trade-offs between how much time
that the learner takes in terms of
interactions with the environment and
how much time that it takes in terms of
the computations that it does between
interactions hmm so you know what this
reminds me of it reminds me of two
things it reminds me of mimic
because that was the exact trade-off
that we were making then uh yeah okay
sure and the other thing is it reminds
me of the theory lecture that we did in
the intro to machine learning class when
we talked about sample complexity yes
this is that's that's good that probably
is a better name than experience
complexity let's call it sample
complexity yeah because it really is
about the data that's necessary to be
able to achieve the learning ends all
right all right so this kind of sets the
stage for what reinforcement learning is
and how we compare different learners to
each other and how we compare the
outputs of those learners to each other
what we're gonna dive into next is
actual algorithms for doing this kind of
learning that's what can ask you a
question sure
so why are we talking about space
so space complexity so that's a good
question in computer science usually
computation time and computation space
are the two dimensions along which we
evaluate algorithms here I guess we
could do that too you could talk about
the space that an algorithm uses of
learning algorithm uses but it's
generally not that interesting
generally we don't we're not limited by
the space complexity we usually run into
issues more quickly on the computational
or the sample complexity side</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
