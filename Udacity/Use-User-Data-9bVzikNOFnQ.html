to clean up now that we actually have
user data to use and users log again
first I'd like you to remove all mention
of anonymous owner we know who the
logged-in users are now so we shouldn't
need to fall back on this instead you
should serve the email address of the
current user I'd also like you to finish
the goal we had on all of this which was
to change the main activity screen to
show the user's name and then list like
this we're also using the encoded
version of their email as the key to
their user data entry and because of
this if we simply have the encoded email
everywhere in the app we can easily load
up any associated data with the user
when the user logs in in the login
activity we have access to their email
through the auth data object and at that
point we can encode it which I'd like
you to do in step 3 then the fourth
thing that I'd like you to do is store
the encoded email as the current user in
shared preferences you should also store
the provider that's being used there as
well this will be helpful because it'll
allow you to basically easily grab this
information anywhere from the app it
also makes this information available to
us on load if the user happens to close
the app okay the full spec is on its way
let me transfer it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
