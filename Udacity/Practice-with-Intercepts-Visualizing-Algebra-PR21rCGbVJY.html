equation and I set y equal to 0 I know
any number times zero is zero so i have
negative two x equals 8 dividing both
sides by negative 2 i get x is equal to
negative 4 so our x intercept occurs at
x equals negative 4 and the point is
negative 4 comma 0 for the y intercept i
set x equal to 0 negative 2 times 0 is 0
and i'm left with 4 y is equal to 8 we
divide both sides by 4 to get y is equal
to 2 so our y intercept occurs at y
equals 2 but the point is 0 comma 2 for
the second equation we can find the
x-intercept in the same way we set y
equal to 0 so this term drops out and i
get 3x is equal to 6 then we divide both
sides by 3 and x equals 2 so our x
intercept occurs at x equals 2 and we
have the point 2 comma 0 this
y-intercept is a little bit harder we do
the same process for y intercepts we set
x equal to 0 so x is 0 so i'm left with
9 y is equal to 6 we want to solve for y
so we need to divide by 9 so i have y is
equal to 69 if we remember back from
fractions we know that a 3 goes into
both the numerator and the denominator
so i can simplify this fraction 6/3
makes two and 9/3 makes three so i'm
left with two thirds 0 comma two thirds
is our y intercept here for this last
equation we can find the x-intercept
again by setting y equal to 0 then to
solve for x we divide both sides by 4 0
/ 4 makes 0 so our x intercept occurs at
the point 0 0 to find the y-intercept we
let X equal 0 so i get y is equal to 0
whoa this is the same point and they're
both the origin so something's going on
with this line will learn about this
equation in the upcoming lessons but if
you're interested try graphing this and
see if you can figure out what's going
on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
