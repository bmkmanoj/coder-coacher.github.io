you're going to solve the problem of how
to round numbers and this is going to
require using a new Python function we
haven't introduced yet in lecture but
you'll be able to figure it out as part
of this homework problem but it's a
pretty tough question so that's why it
has two gold stars the new function that
you'll use is the STR function the STR
function takes as input any number and
it turns that number into a string so
the output of STR applied to a number is
a string that represents the number that
was passed in so if we evaluated STR on
the number 89 what that evaluates to is
the string containing the characters 8
and 9 so it's a string that looks like
the number that was passed in but
instead of being a number now it's a
string if you understand STR you'll be
able to solve this question so your goal
for this question is given a variable X
so at the beginning of your code X has
been initialized to store the value of
any decimal number what your coach to do
is print out the nearest whole number to
X so here's a few examples so if the
value of x is 3.14159 what your code
should print out is 3 if the value of x
is 27.6 3 your code should print out 28
and to keep this a little simpler you
can assume that the value of x is not
negative so this is going to require you
to combine several things that you've
seen in unit 1 the only new thing that
you need to solve this is the STR
function that we've just explained
everything else that you need to solve
this is something that you already know
from unit 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
