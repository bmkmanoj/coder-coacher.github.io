going to choose two other points we can
see that to go from this point to the
second point we need to rise three units
up and run six units to the right
because we went up vertically three
units we know that this is a positive 3
and since we traveled six units to the
right we know that the run is really a
positive six in the positive direction
when we find the slope are the M we're
really finding the ratio of the rise /
the run where do you know that 36 is
really the same thing as one-half this
is great we got the same slope as from
before we can see that the slope of 36
is the same thing as one-half it always
puts us on our line but remember we can
also read slope in other directions I
don't have to start from this point and
go to this point I could go in the
reverse direction if I started from this
point 66 I would travel down three units
and then left six units so here the
vertical distance is really a drop it's
a three unit distance down so the rise
would be negative 3 we move three units
down in a negative direction and six
units left in a negative direction since
both of these directions are negative we
know the rise is really negative 3 and
the run is really negative 6 a negative
divided by a negative makes a positive
so we're left with 36 or one-half that's
pretty cool anyway we've try and find
the slope we always get the same ratio
we just need to be careful about our
directions and our negative signs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
