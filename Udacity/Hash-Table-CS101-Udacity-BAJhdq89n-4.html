you understand the goal of a hash table
so the question is if we have B buckets
in our hash table and we have K key
words and we should assume that K is
much greater than B that they're more
keywords then we have buckets the
question is which the properties should
the hash function have and remember what
the hash function is is it's a function
that takes in a keyword produces a
number and what that number does is
gives us the position in the hash table
which is the bucket where that key would
would appear the first choice is output
a unique number between 0 and K minus 1
so each keyword maps to its own output
number the second choice is output a
number between 0 and B minus 1 the
number of buckets that we have the third
choice is it should map approximately K
divided by B of the keywords to bucket 0
that means for that number of keywords
the output of the hash should be 0 and
it should map to the first bucket so the
fourth choice is map approximately K
divided B of the keywords to bucket B
minus 1 that's the last bucket and the
final choices it should map more of the
keywords to bucket 0 then it maps to
bucket 1 so check all of the properties
that we would like the hash function to
have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
