subtract vectors and we have seen how to
multiply vectors by scalars this might
lead you to ask can we multiply two
vectors it turns out that there are
several different notions of vector
multiplication perhaps the first one we
might think of just multiplying
corresponding coordinates doesn't turn
out to be useful in many applications
however there are other notions of
multiplication which are very useful one
of the most important operations we can
perform on vectors is the inner product
also called the dot product since we
often represent it by placing a dot
between the vectors being multiplied
it's important stems from its geometric
interpretation it lets us find the angle
between two different vectors more
precisely the inner product of the
vectors V and W in Euclidean space
satisfies the following identity V dot W
equals the magnitude of V times the
magnitude of W times the cosine of theta
or theta is the angle between the
vectors V and W if we were to draw them
emanating from the same point
technically there are two angles between
the vectors a shorter one and a longer
one we always use the shorter one by
convention note that the inner product
of two vectors is a number not a vector
using the inverse of the cosine function
also called the arc cosine we can solve
for this angle it equals the arc cosine
of the dot product of V and W divided by
the product of the magnitudes of V and W
another way we can think of this formula
is as the following the arc cosine of
the normalization of V dotted with the
normalization of W of course unless we
have a nicer way of computing the dot
product of two vectors this formula
doesn't do us much good it turns out
that there is a nicer way to compute the
inner product and it is similar to our
first candidate notion for multiplying
vectors to compute V W we can multiply
the corresponding components of V and W
and then we can add those products
together so for example
the dot product of the vectors 1 2 - 1 &amp;amp;
3 1 0 is 1 times 3 plus 2 times 1 plus
negative 1 times 0 which equals 5 this
means that the angle between these two
vectors is the dot product of V NW which
is 5 divided by the magnitude of V which
is the square root of 6 and the
magnitude of W which is the square root
of 10
this gives about 0.87 radians which is
about 50 degrees there are some
interesting consequences of this
connection between the inner product of
two vectors and their angle first recall
that the cosine of X is always bounded
below by negative 1 and above by 1 no
matter what X is using the earlier
equation that the dot product of V and W
is the product of the magnitudes times
cosine of theta we see that the dot
product is bounded below by negative
magnitude of V times magnitude of W and
above by magnitude of V times magnitude
of W we can express this inequality more
succinctly as the absolute value of V W
is less than or equal to the product of
the magnitudes of V and W this is a
famous inequality called the Koshi
Schwarz inequality and you will see this
inequality pop up all over linear
algebra and mathematics in general let's
assume for the moment that neither V nor
W is the zero vector which would mean
that the dot product is automatically 0
what does it mean if V dot W actually
equals the magnitude of V times the
magnitude of W from our earlier equation
it means that the cosine of theta equals
1 and this tells us that theta must
equal 0 in both degrees and in radians
in other words the vectors V and W are
pointing in the same direction similarly
if V dot W equals the negative of the
product of the magnitudes we can
conclude that cosine of theta equals
negative 1 which means that theta equals
pi radians
or 180 degrees and that in turn means
that V and W are pointing in opposite
directions
finally if V dot W equals zero then
since we assumed that neither he nor W
was the zero vector this means that
cosine of theta must equal zero this
means that theta equals PI over two
radians or 90 degrees so V and W are at
a right angle to each other one last
thing to consider is what happens when
you take the dot product of a vector
with itself in this case the angle
between the two vectors is 0 both
radians and degrees so cosine of theta
will equal 1 so our formula reduces to V
dot V equals the magnitude of V squared
after a little rearrangement we can see
that the magnitude of V equals the
square root of V dot V this gives us
another interpretation of the magnitude
of a vector this time in terms of its
dot product</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
