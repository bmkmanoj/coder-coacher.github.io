can't stop playing it's plagued does any
points so this is Basin so scaring the
Internet mean the the Doge dog and this
is just one of you know a ton of
different modifications to this game
that are out here and you will have one
yourself how long do you think it took
the guys who made this to do this
honestly for experienced programmers
probably like 10 minutes that's so cool
how long do you think it'll take our
students to have their own version
working yeah maybe a little more than 10
minutes maybe like an hour okay
but to even just make some little
changes how long I could be doing that
in that's yeah okay so literally this
stuff isn't that hard that was what was
the most mind-blowing to me when I
started going over how this all works
and you'll have your own version in ten
minutes so keep watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
