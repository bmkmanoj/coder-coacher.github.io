a Cartesian coordinate system in this
system we have an origin and three
Direction vectors called x y and z the
origin is some fixed point spaced whose
the location everyone agrees on this
point can be anything I could build a
world based on a location of a surveyors
marker a dot drawn on a tablet or a
reference point I simply imagine for
example if I'm designing a great new
teapot I don't really care where the
rest of the world is located so I could
state that my origin is just a point in
empty space I might then build up the
teapots model so that this origin point
is in the center of the bottom of the
teapot here's a prettier view since I
want you to see the 3d coordinates
better the three Direction vectors
define the axes of the coordinate system
they are normally each perpendicular to
the other that is the angles here here
and here are all each 90 degrees it's
possible to define a coordinate system
with axes that are not perpendicular but
this is rarely done in practice for
example finding the distance between two
points becomes a tricky concept when the
axes are not mutually perpendicular
given an origin and three vectors we can
then define the location of any point in
space with a triplet of numbers for
example this point has a triplet of two
three and four as it's two units along
the x three along the Y and four along
the Z 3d vectors are described by a
similar coordinate reference system
except that the origin is not needed a
vector describes a motion which again
can be described by three numbers that
is it describes how far to move to get
from one point to another
however this movement is not fixed in
any particular location in space to
understand the difference think about
time a specific time is like a point an
amount of time is like a vector it
specifies a duration but no starting
time is given</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
