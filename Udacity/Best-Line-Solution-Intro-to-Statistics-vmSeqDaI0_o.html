because it seems to describe the data
almost perfectly where's the red one a
substantial error is does the green
curve even more so let's look at more
data which line would you pick the one
in the middle the red one the blue one
or perhaps any of those perhaps it was
all equally good terms of green is the
right answer let's just look at this the
blue one suffers no loss for the three
points over here but a fairly
substantial loss for the other three
data points let's call this loss see so
the blue curve would have an error of
three times C squared if this distance
here is called see the reason why it's
squared is because you have three of
those and we're using the quadratic
distance similarly the red one is the
same problem three C squared for the red
one now how about the green one for the
green one we have arrows for all six
points but now the amount of the error
itself is half as big as C so you're
going to write C over two to the square
and when you work this out you'll find
that this is 6 over 4 C square which is
the same as 3 over 2 C square so the
total error for the green one the
quadratic error is half as big as it is
for the blue one and that's a surprise
there's to do that with effect that in a
quadratic version of the error large
errors count much much more than small
errors so green is the best regression
line we can find for this data over here
among the choices I've given you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
