function for writing JSON is called
dumps and just like we had loads this
stands for dump string if we just use
dump in Python that would expect a file
arguments we're writing it directly to a
file but we'll be just just be using
dumps and you can pass in two dumps a
Python object in this case let's just
say 1 2 3 a list and dumps will convert
that to JSON for us let's go ahead and
see that in the terminal you can see I
didn't put quotes around this because
this is the actual list object we're
converting to JSON it outputs a string
that's what these quotes are of the JSON
representation which looks almost
identical that's pretty cool huh and if
we were to make this object a little bit
more complicated map the string 1 to the
number 1 and 2 to the number 2 we get
our JSON now the order changed because
order is not defined in dictionaries but
we get our JSON now let's see where
escaping comes into play if I were to
instead print the string to alright to
make this string man said pool what
would dumps do so what I did is I
changed the value for the the 2 key to a
string
remember these single quotes are
delineating the string and then the
string has an internal section with
double quotes in it our JSON library
will escape that for us and you can see
here that it is printing out a Python
string that is valid JSON and the Python
version of the string has double quotes
in it
I mean double slashes in it you need to
be careful because this is not in itself
valid JSON this is valid Python
representing valid JSON that's why you
have these double slashes so you need to
be careful when you are copying and
pasting code you know or copying pasting
JSON and it's in and out of Python that
you get the escaping right if I were to
take this and instead print it so we can
see the actual value we just have the
single back slashes which is the actual
valid JSON so time for a quick little
quiz ok what is the valid JSON
representation for this Python data
structure so this is Python code will
include text version of this so you can
copy and paste it into your editor and
I'd like you to put in this text box
what the eval and JSON version of this
is basically I'm testing the your
ability to use the JSON module and have
it escape properly now remember I don't
want to see the Python version of the
JSON string I want to see the actual
JSON string that if you were sending
this over to wire to somebody that would
be interpreted properly by the JSON
Reeder good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
