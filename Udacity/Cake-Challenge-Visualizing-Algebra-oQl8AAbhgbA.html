we know when half of it was eaten so i
need to subtract off half of my cake i
also know that three tenths of the
remaining half of the cake was also
eaten so i have three tenths of a half I
remember of means multiply so I need to
take three tenths and multiply it by
half and this three tenths of a half was
eaten so i need to subtract it off as
well so i have one whole cake minus half
a cake minus three tenths of one half of
cake i'm going to clean this up and take
out the words so I have one for one
whole cake minus a half and then minus 3
20's I got three 20s by doing the
multiplication here i have 3 over 20 or
three 20s to subtract fractions i know i
need to find a common denominator I
don't have to worry about the one when
finding a common denominator I can
change one to two halves three thirds or
four fourths I can change it into
anything pretty easily for two and
twenty I know the least common multiple
or the least common denominator is 20
it's the smallest number that both two
and twenty go into I can also do this
using my factor tree I know the common
factor for two and twenty is to the
other factor of 2 is one and the other
factor of 20 is 10 1 x 2 x 10 makes 20
so to change one half to twentieths i
know i need to multiply by 10 / 10 so
one-half is the same thing as 10
twentieths for 320th I don't need to
multiply by anything i already have
twentieths so I just keep the numerator
but I need to change this one to change
the 1 i'm going to multiply by 20 / 20 I
know 20 20th is still one hole so 20 20
s minus 10 20th is 10 twentieths this
should make sense because I know if I
start with one whole cake and subtract
top half of it I should still have half
of it left 10 20th is really the same as
one half now I still need to subtract
off my 3 20 s so 10 20 s minus 3 20 s is
720 s if you said seven twentieths
excellent work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
