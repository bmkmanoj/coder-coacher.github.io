correct answers amazing work if you got
this one correct when we start solving
this problem we want to multiply by the
LCD which is x times X plus one it's the
product of these two denominators we
cancel the factors that reduce to one
and then we distribute the remaining
factors to get our next terms so we'll
have five x times X plus 1 plus 6 times
X which equals 14 times X plus 1 next we
distribute the 5x and the 14 take it our
new equation I have a quadratic term
here so I know I need a factor I'm going
to move these terms to the left side so
that way I can set this equation or this
left-hand side of my equation equal to
zero will combine like terms first by
adding five x + 6 X to get 11 X next
we'll subtract these two terms from both
sides of our equation the 14 doesn't
have a like term on this side of the
equation so I put it last this gives us
5x squared minus 3x minus 14 which
equals 0 next we want to factor this
quadratic by finding the factors of
negative 70 that sum to negative 3 these
factors are negative 10 and positive 7
we use these two factors to rewrite our
middle term and factor by grouping so
this quadratic can be factored as 5x
plus 7 times X minus 2 we want to make
sure that we set it equal to 0 so we can
set each factor equal to 0 and solve for
x we set this first factor equal to 0
and the second factor equal to 0 doing
so we can solve and we get X is equal to
negative seven fifths and X is equal to
positive 2 but we're not done yet we
want to make sure we check the excluded
values to see if either of these are not
part of the solution well the only
excluded values are x equals 0 and x
equals negative 1 if x 40 this fraction
would be undefined and if X was equal to
negative 1 this fraction would be
undefined so r 2 values of negative
seven fifths and positive two are
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
