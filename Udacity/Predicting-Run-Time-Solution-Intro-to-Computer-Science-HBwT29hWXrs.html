what we get and while it's running let's
think about what we should get so we can
look at the examples that we did so far
and try to make some predictions so we
saw when the value passed in was 10 to
the 5 that the time it took to execute
was 0.005 when the time passed in was
ten to the six so 1 million we saw that
the time to execute was 0.05 and now
we're trying to predict 10 to the 9 if
we look at the pattern here every time
we increase n by a factor of 10 the time
also multiplies by a factor of 10 and
that's not surprising because the loop
is going around 10 more times the x
number of times we go through the loop
scales as a factor of the input value n
so if we increase n by a factor of 10
the time will also increase by a factor
of 10 and we see we have got our result
now so if we increase by another factor
of 10 we would expect that this would
also increase that it would take about
half a second to do 10 million if we
increased by another factor of 10 we
would expect the running time would also
multiply by 10 so it would be up to
about 5 seconds and if we increased by
another factor of 10 which is the
billion that we tried we had to expect
it to also increase by another factor of
10 getting to be something around 50
seconds so it's not exactly a thousand
times what we had when we did spin loop
passing in a million but it's pretty
close to that now it's taking almost a
minute a thousand times this would be 54
seconds so it's a little bit off from
that but very close and if we tried it a
few more times we might get a slightly
different result let's try it one more
time so we tried it again and this time
we got fifty five point eight nine
seconds pretty close to what we got the
previous time the important point here
is that the running time depends on the
value of the input to spin loop and it
depends on in in a linear way as we
increase the magnitude of n the higher
number of times through the loop the
running time scales linearly with that
value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
