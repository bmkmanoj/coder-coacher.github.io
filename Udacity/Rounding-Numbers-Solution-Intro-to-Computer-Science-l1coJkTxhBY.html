wasn't only a single gold star problem
it was a two gold star problem it
involves combining a lot of things that
you already knew including something new
completely new but that's part of being
a programmer is combining things that
you know and don't know together to
solve new problems so this is difficult
problem you may not know how to do every
step but we can start by working
backwards from our output
sometimes he's easier to solve hard
problems this way but breaking them down
and even starting from the result so we
know what a result should be as
described before 3.14 so on should
result in printing three in twenty six
seven point six three should result in
printing twenty eight to get this we
printed everything before the decimal
point so we did this by printing
everything out and from a string let's
say we found it and called it s before
the location of the decimal point let's
say that location is specified by an
integer point so here s needed to be
three point something we don't really
know what it is right now in the second
example with 27 as the initial starting
point s equalled 28 and so on now
remember these had to be strings so that
was what s should have been now we need
point point represents the location of
the decimal point in each string well we
can see that from looking at our string
so given s we know how to find point its
using the find command so in order to
get s we probably had it as some form of
number and we turn it into string using
STR now the question is what did num
equal to figure out what we want num to
be all we have to do is look at s since
s is just the stream form of num here s
is the string 3 with some change so num
is going to be the same thing but as a
number instead of a string and in our
second example we have the same
situation in step number is some decimal
remainder now the question is how did we
turn our initial value X into num we
want this method to work for any number
X not just the two we have listed here
so if the tenth place is 0.5 or greater
we want increase the entire number X to
the next nearest whole number one way
they do this is by simply adding 0.5 and
we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
