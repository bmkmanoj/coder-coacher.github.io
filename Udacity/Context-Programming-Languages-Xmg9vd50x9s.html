arithmetic expressions like 1+1
evaluates to 2 but we can also consider
more complicated expressions like 1 plus
2 is equal to 3 we can imagine
evaluating this part recursively and
getting the answer 3 and then deciding
that 3 is equal to 3 so this whole thing
evaluates to true and these may not seem
like very complicated or powerful
expressions yet but these are really the
building blocks that we're going to use
to make a working web browser however
what if I give you an expression like
this we want to check and see if X plus
2 is equal to 3 what should this return
actually we're not certain if X is
currently equal to 1 then it should
definitely return 3 but if X is
something else like negative 300 then
this won't work out quite as well we
need to know the value of x to figure
this out and in fact we need to know the
current value of X because a lot of
variables change in fact we can see the
same sort of thing in natural language
here I've written out a sentence the
King of France is bald that is
syntactically entirely valid and we can
imagine trying to figure out if this
sentence is true or false but knowing
what it means whether it represents the
world correctly or not depends on
knowing the current state of the world
for example as of the time of this
recording there is no King of France
France is not a monarchy so it's not
clear what it means to talk about the
hair of the King of France when there is
no King of France similarly if you're
writing a Python program when you write
x plus 1 equals equals 2 and you haven't
yet defined x if there is no King of
France it's not clear what this means
and the Python interpreter is going to
give you a runtime error a runtime error
if X is not yet defined that's not the
only kind of runtime error there are
many ways things can go wrong but it's
one of the most common well let's just
briefly review evaluating expressions in
context in the form of a quiz try it out
I've written a six line Python program
and I would really like it to print out
true three times so each of these print
statements should have its argument
evaluate to true what I'd like you to do
is fill in each blank so that that
happens but you can only fill in blanks
with X Y or Z this is kind of a puzzle
can you solve constraints or do
backwards reasoning to figure out how
things would have to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
