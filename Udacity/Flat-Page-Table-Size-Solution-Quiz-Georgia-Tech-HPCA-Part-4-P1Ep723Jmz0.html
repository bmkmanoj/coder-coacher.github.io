page table size quiz we are asked what
the total size of the page tables in the
system is there are two processes in the
system so there will be two page tables
may need to add up their sizes the page
size is 4 kilobytes the applications
have a 32-bit virtual address space so
we have two processes times 2 to the
32nd bytes of address space divided by 2
to the 12 bytes in a page this is how
many pages we have times the size of an
entry is 8 bytes which gives us 2 times
8 is 16 times 2 2 xx - 2 xx bytes is a
megabyte so we have 16 megabytes note
that it didn't matter how much memory
the processes are actually using the
flat page table needs to have an entry
for every possible page in the virtual
address space not only for the pages we
are actually using also it doesn't
matter how much physical memory we
actually have what matters is what the
size of the entry is so for example this
entry was designed to accommodate up to
a 64 bit physical address even though
the system actually has much less memory
why would you do this well because you
want to build a system such that it can
expand its memory if necessary for
example by adding more memory modules</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
