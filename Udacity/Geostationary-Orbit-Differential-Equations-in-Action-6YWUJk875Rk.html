spaceships so I am very excited now
similar to what we saw in units one and
two we want our spaceship in this case
or it's actually a satellite to get into
orbit
however this is a very special type of
orbit it's a geostationary orbit what
this means is that once the satellite is
in space at a certain distance away from
the earth it will orbit the Earth at
exactly the same rate as that at which
the Earth rotates so two people on earth
it's going to look like this satellite
isn't moving at all which is pretty cool
to show you how this happens we have
this lovely diagram right here which I
warn you is not to scale in the center
we have the earth and initially the
satellite is orbiting at just 200
kilometers away from the Earth's surface
now at a certain moment in fact at the
moment when the rocket first crosses the
x-axis on this diagram the rocket is
going to spit the satellite out and this
is going to propel the satellite away
from its original orbit and eventually
out to the radius that it needs to be at
for geostationary orbit so this red line
right here then it's going to stay along
this red path for as long as it needs to
now the radius of geostationary orbit is
40 2164 kilometers also just an
interesting tidbit this transition orbit
this green curve right here is exactly
half of an ellipse that's tangent to
both of these circular orbits the pink
one and the red one also these orbits
are both perfectly circular even though
my drawing doesn't really show that so
there are three tasks that we would like
you to complete for this problem the
first of these is to find out what the
speed and radius of that initial smaller
orbit is remember like I said this is a
circular orbit so that should make
things a little bit simpler you'll
probably have to use pencil and paper
for this part of the problem
now when the rocket in the satellite
attached to it cross the negative part
of the x-axis for the first time the
rocket fires its engine to increase the
speed of the satellite by the amount
given in the variable called boost this
should remind you a lot of the last
problem of unit 2 so for your second
task we want you to figure out how to
make this boost happen and of course how
to make it happen at the appropriate
time let's go back
fit in the code to look at your last
task this is going to be to figure out
as you've done before what the correct
magnitude of the boost velocity is we
filled in a dummy value of 42 just to
start out with and we've given you
several different options to choose from
one of these is the correct answer once
you've completed the first two tasks
plug in each of these values for boost
and compare the plots to see which one
helps the satellite enter geostationary
orbit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
