tens of thousands of letters away and
even though she's that far away from the
start of the gene it's okay because DNA
can fold as we saw just a second ago and
now her sequence is actually really
close to the beginning of the gene or
the Tata box region here so if I'm a
protein that promotes transcription what
am I called well a sequence that
promotes transcription here this site
would be called an enhancer now not all
sequences have to promote transcription
some of them inhibit transcription and
we call those sequences silencers now if
we know that the effect of an enhancer
or a silencer is because of whether or
not the protein is bound or not I want
you to look at the following scenarios
and tell me which scenario matches with
which level of transcription this could
be a little tricky so focus on each
picture and see if you can match which
ones belong to each other
match the scenario on the left with the
amount of transcription expected on the
right there are three scenarios here on
the left three scenarios on the right
the ones on the right are lettered a B
and C just put the letter in the box
that corresponds to the situation on the
left where you'd expect that situation
to be a match</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
