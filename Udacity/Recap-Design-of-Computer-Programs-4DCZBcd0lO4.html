in this unit first we talked about some
Python features that were maybe new to
you we use complex list comprehensions
and that's something like x squared 4x
in blah blah blah if something we showed
generator expressions and that similar
but with parentheses we talked about
generator functions or just generators
and recognize those with the yield
statement we talked about the idea of
handling different types and this has
the fancy name of polymorphism meaning
different forms and we saw an example of
that in timed calls where we said that
the input n along then there are other
inputs there and could be either an
integer in which case we would do one
thing we're afloat in which case we
would do something else and we check
which is which by using his instance we
talked about the eval function and how
we can use that to map from a string to
a Python object which is the result of
evaluating the string and in particular
the case of evaluating to a function and
a val is a way of making that
computation be done once and getting all
that work over with so that we can then
use that work repeatedly we also talked
about instrumentation and we did timing
with the time clock method that's built
in and then we built up timed call and
time calls routine and we talked about
counting number of implications of
functions or assignment statements or
whatever and there we came up with our
own routine that we called see now I
guess I should say a little bit about
variable naming conventions why did I
use a short name like see here whereas
other places I had longer more
expressive names and I guess the reason
is he was used only for debugging
purposes it wasn't intended to be part
of the final part of the
program and so I felt justified in
having that be short because I was going
to be typing it and deleting it
frequently things that are going to
persist for longer have longer names so
for example it's fine to say for I in
range something where there we know that
I is an index integer and it only
persists over this short loop so it's
okay to have a short name if something
last longer we probably wanted to have a
longer more descriptive name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
