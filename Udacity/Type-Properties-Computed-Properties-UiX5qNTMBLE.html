value for type properties also called
class properties you can think of class
properties as belonging more to the
class itself than to any one instance of
a class because they don't vary across
objects a type property has the same
value for every instance of a class we
use type properties mostly for data we
want every instance of a class to have
easy access to for example if we add a
class called kids movie we might want to
type property called permitted writings
to keep track of which ratings are
permissible for children to indicate
that permitted ratings is a type
property we place the word static or
class in front of its definition type
properties are also referred to as
static properties in languages like C
and Java the value of this property
won't change across movies but it's nice
to have these ratings at our fingertips
it'd also be nice if we had some
information about the reviews for these
movies let's add an array of reviews
from different media outlets but then of
course it'd be really convenient if we
could see the average of the reviewers
scores let's call it a Metascore like
the app Metacritic such a meta score is
known as a computed property a property
that's computed based on existing data
in the class computed properties have
custom getters and optionally custom
setters this one doesn't really need to
set her though here's our custom getter
you probably haven't seen this reduce
function before it's a handy method for
reducing the values of an array to one
value for a fun challenge see if you can
figure out exactly what this code is
doing and post what you find on the
discussion forum for now I'll just tell
you that it's returning the average of
all the scores in this array let's test
out our getter we'll initialize a movie
with some reviewer scores and then
access the meta score using dot syntax
sweet this one out of you a
crowd-pleaser now in looking at the
custom getter for our meta score it may
have occurred to you wait a second what
about the getters and setters for the
other properties guess what we don't
have to write them they're automatically
created when you declare a property</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
