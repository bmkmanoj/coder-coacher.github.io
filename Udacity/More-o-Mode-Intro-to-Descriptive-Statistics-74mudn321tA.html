describe any type of data numerical or
categorical you saw in the last quiz
that male versus female was categorical
and the mode was male however all scores
in the dataset
don't affect the mode necessarily take
this data set the mode is 22 because it
occurs three times and the rest of them
occur once however if we take away the
value 14 the mode will still be 22 now
let's say we add an extreme value like 1
million the mode will still be 22 so we
cannot say that all scores in the data
set will impact the mode this one is
also false if we take a bunch of samples
from a population the mode is likely to
change from sample to sample
let's illustrate this idea with this
applet it's really cool this isn't a
histogram distribution this is called a
bell-shaped curve and let's pick a
random 5 samples that the software will
generate for us so just look at these
top two you see that the mode is here
which is kind of at the left of this
distribution let's do it again now the
modes here at the right of the
distribution if we do it again the modes
again at the kind of far left of the
distribution now here there's not even a
mode so you can see that if we take
samples the mode is somewhat arbitrary
and it won't necessarily be similar to
other modes and it also won't
necessarily represent the population
another thing about the mode is that it
changes as you change the bin size so if
we make the bin size smaller
looks like the mode is going to the left
here it's at about 470 here it looks
like it starts at about 450 and the mode
changes as we change the bin size if we
make the bin size really big then the
mode occurs in this interval between 346
and
514 0.74 so the mode really depends on
how you present the data because this
third point is false we can't really use
the mode to learn about our population
and this is our goal in this course
inferential statistics but still the
mode is important to take into account
when describing a data set and finally
this last one is false
while there's a procedure to find the
mode where you look at all the data
values you see which one occurs the most
or you look at the histogram and you see
which bin has the highest frequency we
can't describe the mode with an equation
and this is why we often use the mean or
the average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
