were asked which of these are true
l1 capacity is less than L to capacity
this should be true because the l2 cache
needs to have hits for things that were
l1 misses
so if l2 has the same or lower capacity
than l1 then not many things that miss
in l1 will actually be hit in l2 and we
want the l2 to still have a lot of hits
so that things don't go to even slower
caches or even to memory the l1 latency
should it be less than l2 latency and
the answer is yes we look first in l1
cache not because it has a better chance
of finding the data than the l2 cache
but because it has a lower hit latency
the number of accesses in level 1 cache
is it lower than the number of accesses
12 to cache this is not true all of the
accesses loads and stores go to l1 cache
but only those that miss in l1 cache go
to l2 cache so the auto cache usually
has a lot fewer accesses than l1 and
finally l1 associativity needs to be
equal to l2 associativity this is
potentially true but usually it isn't
why well because the l1 cache needs to
have a low hit latency and need not have
the capacity of the l2 cache
similarly for associativity the l1 cache
because it needs to be fast can have a
lower associativity whereas the l2 cache
can be slower so we can maybe afford a
higher associativity so typically that's
what happens l1 has a lower
associativity than l2 so this is also
not true</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
