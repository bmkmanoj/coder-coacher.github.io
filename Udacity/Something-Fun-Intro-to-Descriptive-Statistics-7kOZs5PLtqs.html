complicated stuff to wrap up this lesson
we're going to do a little experiment
and it's going to be awesome if you guys
participate together we're all going to
generate sampling distributions of size
1 5 and 10 so here's what we're going to
do pick a number any number between 1
and 1048 click the link to access the
Klout score data and then finds a Klout
score in the row of the number you
picked so if you picked the number 786
for example go to row 786 find what
Klout score that is then write it down
next pick five numbers between 1 and
1048 find the Klout scores in these rows
take the average and then write this
number down finally repeat this process
with ten numbers so you should get three
numbers write these numbers in the
Google form with the link below so
essentially we're gonna get a bunch of
means depending on how many of you guys
participate so let's say 1,000 of you
participate then we'll have 1,000 Klout
scores which will then create a
distribution for and this should look
like the population distribution and
we'll also have 1,000 means of samples
of size 5 and we'll have 1,000 means
from samples of size 10 then we'll be
able to graph each of these sampling
distributions and see if it turns out
how we theoretically would have expected
so time for your last quiz of this
lesson is this going to be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
