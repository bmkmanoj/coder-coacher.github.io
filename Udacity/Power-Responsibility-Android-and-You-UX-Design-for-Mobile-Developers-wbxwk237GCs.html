powerful it unlocks so many capabilities
for you to exploit and use in your
applications to deliver amazing delight
to your users
now with that incredible power comes
great responsibility and there's two
things that you can't violate these are
two really really important prime
directives like constraints the first
one is you must be purposeful what does
that mean
just because an API exists in Google
Play services or because there's a thing
that you can do there's a sensor that
exists doesn't mean that you should use
it just for that reason be purposeful
means that understand how you're gonna
deliver the light or some use to your
user why does that feature or sensor
need to be in your application and if it
doesn't don't put it in there expecially
be restrained in how you're creative and
the second one is to be respectful you
need to be respectful of your user
because your application might know a
lot about your user and it's really
important that you use that information
to deliver delight to your user a
context to where application can go from
being amazing to being kind of creepy
