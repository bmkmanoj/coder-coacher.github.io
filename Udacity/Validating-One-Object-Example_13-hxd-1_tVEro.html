validation rules and I'd like you to
start creating some for shopping this
plus plus now writing validation rules
is pretty straightforward in fact if
you'd like I could walk you through
creating one of these rules right now
start to end here let's take a look at
the user Fred Snowden when you're
writing the rules for an object take a
look at the actual object itself in the
database so let's look at user friends
so here's the main known user friends
and it's going to have an arbitrary
number of children for every user that
has friends in the database and then for
each user that has friends they in turn
have a friends list and they're also
going to have an arbitrary number of
friends the friends themselves have
pretty much the same properties that we
just saw ok so first things first let's
map this out in the rules we can see
here that we have user friends those to
match and then here we have a wild card
variable for the users encoded email and
then we have another wildcard variable
to represent each of the friends and
then each friend will have this
structure of properties as matched here
ok so it looks like pretty much this
structure matches this structure that's
good now this is not actually doing any
sort of validation yet notice I haven't
written a single validation rule to
start we could write rules that make
sure that all of the correct properties
are present in the fred encoded email
object so i'll go ahead and start by
writing a new data has children rule
right here this rule will make sure that
all these properties exist and i'll also
go ahead and write one for the time
stamp joined now let's only make sure
that these properties exist it doesn't
make sure that they are the only
properties that exist and it doesn't
protect against writing other arbitrary
properties that could be wrong so do
that we have to use the dollar side war
wild card variables as I described
earlier so I added those variables here
at this point you're completely
confirming the structure of the user
object now you can write more specific
rules for each of these properties
generally you can start by doing type
related validations for example the name
should be as strength and just
continuing down the email should also be
a string has long dude with password is
a boolean and timestamp is a number in
addition we could do a further
validation on the email with the regular
expression i showed you before so it's a
string and its value matches the format
of an email and that's a pretty good
for ensuring the structure these are
friends known</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
