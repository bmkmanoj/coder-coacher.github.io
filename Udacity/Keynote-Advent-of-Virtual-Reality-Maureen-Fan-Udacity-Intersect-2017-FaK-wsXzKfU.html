co-founder of bail Bob studios and
before I start I just want to see how
many of you have seen the VR demo out
there awesome everyone who hasn't you
should all go see it for how many of you
have tried out VR in your lives wow
that's a huge number that's great for my
industry okay so I'm here to talk about
VR and what it means to do interactive
storytelling within VR but before I do
that I want to show you a quick clip of
the types of things that we can do in VR
specifically for our company this is
called invasion and this is a short
animated trailer of what it would be
like to be in VR
okay now imagine instead of this 2d
screen here you are on an icy lake and
you look down you have a little furry
bunny body and you can hop around the
ice and when you squat your bunny body
gets really fat just the way it would in
real life if you were bunny
and imagine there's snow falling all
around you and you can the bunny is
actually coming up to sniff you and
those aliens are about to attack you and
you notice that there no cuts in there
then I'll explain more about that but
before I go there I want to ask you guys
how many of you guys consider yourselves
athletes okay how about
singer-songwriters
how about astronaut just one okay what
always at least one person says yes okay
so if your or your five-year-old selves
you would have said yes to all the
questions above so the question is what
happens from when you're 5 to becoming
an adult that makes you a little bit
less idealistic maybe someone told you
your sculpture didn't look quite right
in art class or you had a tiger mom like
I did who told me I was totally too
idealistic but we believe in inside
everyone there is still a dreamer and we
know this to be true because it's why we
go watch the movies to experience
characters and stories beyond those that
we meet in our lives
today and we think animation does is way
better than live action because while
live action is still constrained by
reality animation is constrained only by
the creativity within the directors head
which is freedom so animation is art in
motion it takes you to completely
different worlds and makes it feel so
real that you think you could reach out
and touch it
and the last two sentence I just said
which is takes you to a different world
and makes it feel so real that you could
touch it is the definition of VR which
is why we think VR and animation were
made for each other so originally the
mission of our company therefore is to
inspire you to dream that bring that
five year old and you back out
bring out your sense of wonder and help
you realize the potential that you have
within you the company is we're called
bio Voss studios the first one to tell
you about my path really quick is to let
you know that you don't have to know
what you're doing in life and you'll
figure it out you don't have to have a
set plan I started off at eBay as a UI
designer and at Pixar on Toy Story three
ended up as Zynga became vice-president
of games looking over the farmville of
franchise and during that time nights
and weekends I worked on a short
animated film called the dam keeper
which got nominated for an Oscar
basically everything I did I kept on
taking night classes anything that I
really loved to get into the next career
I wanted so I didn't have Udacity back
then but I really wish I did but I went
the physical concrete form and took
community college classes
Erik Darnell was the director of ants
and also the writer and director of all
for Madagascar films he's my co-founder
and chief creative officer and there's
Larry Cutler who is a Pixar early days
he went to Stanford with me master's
thesis in VR realized it was way too
early in the nineties for VR so I was
smart enough to go to Pixar and ended up
at DreamWorks as global head of
character technology and he's a judge
for the technical achievement of words
so three of us got together and started
this company a little over a year ago so
VR is very early in its very early
stages and in terms of advisors this is
not just to brag about how awesome we
are but you're trying to explain to you
how all the original people who did the
transition from 2d to 3d are now
interested in VR because to them it
feels the same as when 2d went to 3d
there's new technology nobody knows
what's going on is art and science put
together and so we have the co-founder
of Pixar the co-founder of
pdi/dreamworks animation former CEO
Lucasfilm co-president of DreamWorks
co-founder twitch and my favorite who I
worship is Glen Keane who was the main
animator for a Little Mermaid Aladdin
beating the bees Pocahontas all the
awesome Disney films and also Chris milk
so what is all the fuss about why do
people like interactive storytelling in
VR storytelling fundamentally
is getting you all to feel empathy for
characters that's really what it's about
it's about making you care so much about
a character that you want to see their
story you want to see do they win do
they fail do they succeed now our
original main character was this little
alien but through VR we realized that
the bunny stole the show and it
specifically because of this moment so
she comes up and sniffs you right and
then she gets on the ground and starts
playing with you and you're like what's
the big deal it's called breaking the
fourth wall in film like in Deadpool you
know how Deadpool looks at you and
starts talking to you but at no point in
Deadpool did you really believe Deadpool
is really talking to you but in VR
something in your reptile brain makes
you believe that Bunny's real and
actually playing with you so we had
people start trying to pet her who at
her wave at her and they started playing
with her on the ground like a dog and
they were sure that she was reacting to
them when she wasn't it was totally
can't animation but at this point we
realized there is something very
different about VR and then there's this
other point where she's runs behind you
and hides behind you and when the aliens
come to shoot and point their lasers at
you
Alvy Ray Smith he said oh my god I'm the
only thing between these aliens and the
bunny I need to save her I can feel her
breath on my shoulder which was really
just the air conditioning from her
office but the point is he's like I have
to save her I love her and at that point
we found we realized we won right in VR
we can make you care about that
character so real that the stakes are so
high that you want to protect her and
actually take care of her and that is
the power of VR something that you can
never get in a 2d screen so that's when
we realize we're really onto something
and that was our first experiment to
even see if we could do VR and from that
experience we realized that invasion
became the top download of VR experience
a cross out that all the platforms and
this was really confusing to us because
we thought VR was for hardcore gamers
right it's just all about gaming but for
this to beat out all the hardcore games
we realized that it's not just about
gaming it's also about storytelling so
what is the future
Villar I don't know but I can speculate
the truth is think about how many years
it took decades it took for a cinema to
become what it is today
the Cutts pans and zooms and all that
that took a lot of experimentation and
that's the phase we're in right now
we're all about experimentation so for
any of you it's great news for you all
because what I'm basically saying is to
ignore everything I'm telling you ignore
everything that everyone's telling you
throw the rule books out and experiment
and try things that are new because
that's the only way we're going to
figure out what the actual language of
VR is and I want to show you a quick
clip of something that we premiered at
Sundance festival
so this is the second episode since
invasion did so well Roth Kirschenbaum
films Roth is a former chairman of
Disney he did maleficence Norway in the
Huntsman Alice in Wonderland they picked
it up to become a feature invasion to
become a Hollywood feature film which is
amazing because usually it's Hollywood
stuffing their IP into the new tech
rather than the other way around so
really excited this is episode 2 but one
thing we did realize with this is we can
make you not only a bunny but a
character that can actually walk around
within the space and have and not only
care about the characters but act upon
that caring which we call compassion and
so now not only can you care you can
actually interact with the characters
help them hurt them do many different
things with the characters which makes
the stakes even higher and we think
that's the next evolution of
storytelling so if you have any
questions feel free to follow us on any
of these things or email me at Maureen
at bill Bob studios.com and I'm happy to
answer any questions you might have
