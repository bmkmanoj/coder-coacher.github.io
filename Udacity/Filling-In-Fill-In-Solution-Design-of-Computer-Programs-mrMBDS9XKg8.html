digits to be the same length as the
number of letters because we want to
substitute them 1 for 1 1 2 3 4 ABC or
whatever so we want to ask itertools dup
permutations to take permutations of the
letters take an N at a time where n is
the number of letters the length of the
letters that part's easy this parts a
little bit more complicated how do we
find the letters here's what i did i
used the in the regular expression they
are e module i use the find all function
so that says find all letters from A to
Z and I didn't specify here capitals
before my interpretation and the general
rules for these type of crypt arithmetic
problems that they should be capitals
but if you allow lower case as well
that's fine so find them all within the
formula make a set of those because if
letter occurs more than once we don't
want multiple versions of it we just
want individual ones and then join them
together into a string now I should say
that I snuck in one piece of code here
that you haven't seen before that may
seem wild at first and that's the very
first line it says from future import
division that seems pretty amazing Wow
Python has a built-in time machine so
what does it mean to import division
from the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
