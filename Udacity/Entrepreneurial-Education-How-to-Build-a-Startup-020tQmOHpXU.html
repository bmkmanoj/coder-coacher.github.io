piece which is why you're here how do we
teach entrepreneurship well in the past
entrepreneurial education was about
execution we're going to teach you how
to write a business plan we're going to
teach you how to put together the
PowerPoint for the vc presentation where
if we're doing it really well we'll have
you do lots of research but it really
assumed it was all about execution what
we now know that's just simply not the
case
entrepreneurial education the reason why
you're taking this class is about the
search for the business model and we're
going to teach you how to search and so
for that what that means about
entrepreneurial education is that
eventually we do need you to know
everything in MBA knows eventually if
your success in growing your startup
into a large company you are going to
need to know about accounting and HR and
organizational behavior and global
leadership and etc but at first you need
a different set of skills that just
never existed before and so welcome to
the first class of its type that's going
to put search first and that's a radical
change it's not just one more
methodology so this class is going to
teach you all the skills about strategy
and process and organization and
eventually if you build the successful
company will then allow you to write the
plans and operating documents and
financial spreadsheets to actually
execute the company so hold on to your
seats we're about to get started and
let's jump into business models and
customer development</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
