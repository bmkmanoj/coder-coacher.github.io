make this a bit more challenging let's
multiply two binomials I'm going to
start with numbers to give a sense of
the model now even I can't do this that
quickly in my head I actually go about
this another way I split up 12 into 10 +
2 + 14 and 2 10 plus 4 when I do
two-digit multiplication in my head I'm
actually thinking about a rectangle the
first factor or side of my rectangle is
10 and 2 the second factor or side of my
rectangle is 10 plus for now this is
pretty easy to visualize and think about
multiplying the numbers together I would
have 140 20 + 8 to get each of these
areas I'm simply multiplying the sides
of the rectangles this one is 10 and
this one is 10 so 100 this rectangle is
2 and this side is 10 because this site
is 10 so 20 here this opposite side is
also 10 so i have 10 times 4 which is 40
and finally this bottom rectangle is 2
by 4 so i get a total of eight adding up
all of these areas i get 168 try
multiplying this out and you'll find its
168 pretty amazing this also makes sense
because i have 10 x 10 which is 100
these ones are really in the 10 spot
then I have 2 times 10 which is 20 again
this one is in a 10 spot for x 10 which
is 40 and 2 times 4 which is eight these
are for the one spot I hope this is a
new way to think about multiplication
for some of you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
