4th equals 81 and this form is
considered to be exponential form now
another new form that we're going to
talk about is logarithmic form Log form
involves a logarithm and it's just
another way of writing this equation the
key idea for a logarithm is that its
base will be the same base in the
equation above so if we have 3 to the
4th equals 81 then we'll have log with a
base of 3 set equal to for the answer to
the logarithm is an exponent meaning if
I take the log base 3 of some number
I'll get 4 and it turns out that that
number has to be 81 so we read this
statement as log base 3 of 81 equals 4
we're asking ourselves what's the
exponent that we need to raise a base of
32 to get 81 well that exponent is 4
when we take the logarithm of any number
will always get an exponent we use
logarithms as a way to undo a reverse
raising a number to a power for example
if we had this exponential form we can
also write it in logarithmic form this
base becomes the base of our logarithm
so we'll have log base 2 of some number
equals 3 the exponent we know that this
number must be eight since two raised to
the third power equals eight the log
base 2 of 8 is the exponent that we need
to raise to 2 in order to get 8 so in
this case log base 2 of 8 equals 3 in
general when we have something written
in exponential form with a base raised
to an exponent equal to a number we can
rewrite this in logarithmic form we can
make the base be the base of our
logarithm the number is the argument for
our logarithm and the answer is the
exponent so log with base B of some
number always will give us an exponent I
think the key idea in any of these
situations is that the log of a number
results in an exponent
the same was true for this example</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
