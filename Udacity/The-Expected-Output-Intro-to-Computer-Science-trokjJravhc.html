dates were the same we said that was
okay
the requirement is that the second date
cannot be before the first date it's
fine if they're the same and then the
answer should be zero
there are no dates between those two the
second one the second input is one day
after the first input so the output
should be one for the third one the
second date is before the first date the
way we specify the problem that's an
invalid input that means the output is
undefined and our procedure could
actually be correct no matter what it
does for this input it would be more
useful if it gives a clear error message
or maybe even more useful if it gives
negative one but the way we specify the
problem we don't have to worry about
what the output is there because we're
saying that these inputs are invalid for
the fourth one the dates are a year
apart June 29 in 2013 is one year after
June 29 and 2012 and so there are 365
days and a non-leap year and it's
non-leap year because the February
that's included is the February in 2013
for the final one we're going from June
29 2012 to June 31st 2013 if you know
your calendar well you know that there's
actually no June 31st the way we
specified the problem we said that both
input dates have to be validates in the
Gregorian calendar that means the output
here is undefined we'd like to get some
kind of error output but there's no
requirement for our procedure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
