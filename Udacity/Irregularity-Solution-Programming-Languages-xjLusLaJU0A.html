tricky quiz because it requires two
kinds of reasoning for each string we
have to figure out whether it's in our
not and also whether it's in p or not we
just saw in the previous quiz that
unbalanced parentheses like this single
open are not in P so this is looking
good so far but for it to be part of the
answer we want we'd have to show that it
is in our well if we look carefully in
fact it is here's how I'm going to do it
for this first opening parenthesis for
this star I'm going to repeat it one
time and then for this closing
parenthesis for this totally different
star I'm going to repeat it 0 times so
I'm going to end up with one open and 0
closes so this unbalanced open
parenthesis is in the regular expression
but not in the language of the grammar
how about this balanced open followed by
closed well that is in the language of P
I apply rule one and then rule two to
get rid of the P so it fails our second
clause how about this open closed closed
this is unbalanced the scales would be
tipped to the right so it's not in P
we're looking good so far is it in our
yes for this star I'm going to repeat it
once and for this totally unrelated star
I'm going to repeat it twice both of
these open open closed closed and open
open open close close close they're all
in P so they're disqualified because of
Clause 2 in fact all of the strings here
are in the language of our it's just
that these three are also in the
language of P</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
