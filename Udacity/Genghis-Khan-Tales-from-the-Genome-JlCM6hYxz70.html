that performed the Y chromosome analysis
revealed that a significant proportion
of men alive today are actually direct
lying descendants from one man who lived
about a thousand years ago a whopping 16
million of men alive today actually
share the same Y chromosome that's like
point five percent of the world
population of men or about one in 200
men so how did a Y chromosome spread so
fast and only about 30 generations
almost all the evidence points to a
single man Genghis Khan about ten
percent ten percent of all men living
within the borders of what was once the
Mongol Empire shared the same Y
chromosome and Genghis Khan was a
warlord an emperor of the Mongol Empire
who gained land mainly through battle
and trade now the key to understanding
how his Y chromosome might have spread
so fast is not so hidden and a quote
that's attributed to him and the methods
of his empire expansion the greatest joy
for a man is to defeat his enemies to
drive them before him and to take from
them all they possess to see those they
love in tears to ride their horses and
to hold their wives and daughters and
his arms Genghis Khan was one of the
most ruthless warriors who ever lived
and his Y chromosome has been so
successful in part because of the
forcible rape and reproduction of the
many women that he came in contact with
and now point five percent of the world
is the genetic evidence to prove it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
