threats in the context of tracking
information or online information
somebody tracks your activities that you
do online okay so tracking essentially
is its collection of information about
the activities that you you do online so
a thread is collection of such
information okay the process is act of
tracking what you do if they do it with
your consent that's one thing but doing
it without your consent obviously that
many of us will view is is invasion of
our privacy okay so one thread is we
without consent doing this this without
consent if they have you know collected
this information how can they use have
did I agree to the specific use that
they have in mind if I had not agreed to
it but I was this was not sort of
revealed to me well that's a threat to
my privacy how long can they keep some
information that I agreed they can
collect about me so this is we talking
tracking information you visited a
certain website you search for certain
results how long do they keep this
information who do they share this
information with maybe this information
has some value associated because it
sort of describes me what I do what my
preferences may be in things like that
so they can actually sell it to somebody
else and if the selling to somebody else
did I agree to it are these parties that
I had authorized or I had given consent
that the sharing is okay with me or do
they do it without my knowledge if they
do it without my knowledge of course
that's another privacy threat because my
information then gets to somebody else
that I had no idea that they would be
able to gain access to it so I may
actually specify what they can collect
and who they can share it with and how
long they can retain but what and so
that's what constitutes we're going to
see an example sort of a privacy policy
that we agree to but what if the policy
changes actually its information
collected by me actually they change it
to
more lacks policy then and they don't
ask me to agree to it then they will be
able to do things that they were not
able to do before and they were not able
to do those things before because I
hadn't agreed to it to them so now by
changing the policy they basically can
get around that requirement that you
know I give explicit consent and that's
a threat if Paul privacy policies can be
changed any time without you know
informing me and getting my consent then
that's a threat to my privacy and
finally sort of information security
this is what we've been talking about
they collect all this information what
if they have a breach a bad guy walks
away with all this information they
didn't explicitly share it with the bad
guy they were trying to sort of respect
my privacy and only share it with
whoever I had agreed to but a bad guys
they don't care about consent in
agreement the reason they're able to
breach and get access to this
information that's private is because
maybe my information security was not
what it should be we I didn't have good
identity in Access Management didn't
have good monitoring in place and and
various other threats so if they're
going to collect this information and in
good faith going to try to use it the
way you agree that they be able to use
it well this still had to protect it
from the bad guys and if they don't that
is a privacy threat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
