features we could have selected to build
this model for example we could have
looked at locations at different times
for example at 2:00 a.m. or 10:00 p.m.
where a person is more likely to be at
their home we could also have used the
XY coordinates instead of the distances
or we could have used a different
distance metric let's explore this a
little bit further we could have taken
the distance between point 1 and point 2
as the absolute value of the differences
between the x and y coordinates of the
two points think about this distance
function for a second within cities only
crows and pigeons and mostly birds can
move in a straight line from point A to
point B the rest of us non flying people
have to cover this particular distance
this distance is called the Manhattan
distance of the taxicab distance what
features would you have chosen to solve
this problem pick a couple then use some
of the techniques you have learnt in
lesson two to analyze them for example
you could calculate the information
gained both for the Euclidean distance
we chose earlier and the Manhattan
distance denoted here
check the box when you have done this
