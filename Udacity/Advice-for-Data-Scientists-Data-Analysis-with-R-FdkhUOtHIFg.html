from a Tom and Shawn who are also two
data scientists at Facebook they'll
offer their advice for how to work with
Deena my advice to data scientists or
future data scientists is find datasets
that you're interested in and work with
them and play with the data and just
develop experience with playing with
data good data science comes from good
questions not from fancy techniques or
from you know having the right data it
comes from motivating your research with
an idea that you care about and that you
think other people will care about so
almost you almost have to think about it
like a journalist would you have this
audience and they're going to consume
the work that you produce and you want
them to care about it and be interested
and so starting with the right questions
and in particular something that
motivates you as a person is really the
right starting point not like you know
some fancy technique that you want to
learn</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
