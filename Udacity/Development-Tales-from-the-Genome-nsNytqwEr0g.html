how an individual gene gets turned into
a protein this genetic code we analogize
to a book of recipes representing our
genome we want to revisit this analogy
for this lesson but we're going to think
about it a little bit differently
instead of these ingredients being used
to make a single protein we're going to
take each of these ingredients
individually as its own protein to build
a particular trade or even a whole human
being let's get started and if we want
to build a human being the first thing
I'm going to do is take our ingredient
which represents one protein and I'll
start measuring out one tablespoon okay
so this is one protein that's right well
well one human coming right up I'm
Lauren did you just pour all of the
flour in the bowl I mean yeah you said
fire was in the recipe and I'm assuming
he takes a lot of power to make a human
we're huge this this is true but it like
a gene you can't just add the whole
thing at once you gotta had the right
amount at the right time to get the
right product I'm sorry but I guess
you're right there are over 20,000 genes
in the human genome if we added all of
them all at once all at the same time
every cell would be identical because
they'd all have the same ingredients at
the same time and obviously that's not
what we want to get different cell types
at different times we actually need to
add different ingredients at different
times and in different amounts so we
must specify these ingredients and we
have to specify the amounts well where
does the specificity come from like how
does the skin cell know to be a skin
cell and how does a brain cell know to
be a brain cell the short answer is
development development is a process by
which the right gene is added at the
right time to make the right cell type
it's how one cell knows to be a certain
cell type out of the many thousands it
could possibly be for example the cells
in your hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
