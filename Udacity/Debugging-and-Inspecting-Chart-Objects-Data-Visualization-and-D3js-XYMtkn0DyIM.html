browser and actually see what it's
created I'll be stepping through each
line of the dimple code that I just
explained and inspecting what gets
created at each step of the way i'll be
using the same technique of stopping
using the debugger in the middle of the
draw function so i can run the code line
by line just to make sure let's open up
our console here navigate to the console
tab and then refresh our browser so the
JavaScript debugger catches as you can
see here again on line 19 the JavaScript
debugger caught we can go back to our
console make sure that our data has
properly been loaded and now we're ready
to start diving in and creating some
charts as I just mentioned we can use
the dimple chart method to initialize a
new dimple jes chart with the SVG
element we want to draw the chart into
and your data object we've try running
this code it's going to break and it's
going to tell us that we cannot append
to undefined now this might seem like a
cryptic error but if you go back to our
sublime text what we can see here is
that the debugger caught before we
create our SVG now when you're working
in this interactive fashion you have to
be sure that you know exactly what's in
scope and one so simply copying this
code that creates a new SVG element and
append it to the body we can paste that
into the browser console and now we have
an SVG element rerunning the chart
creation code for dimple jas we now see
undefined returned if we inspect what my
chart is we can see a new object dimple
dot chart there's a few properties
defined when it prints the console and
the whole assortment of methods here
which represents everything we can call
on a chart or access from a chart so
these are methods and properties like
with x and y there's quite a bit here I
don't want to get too deep into it but I
simply wanted to show you you
not be afraid of libraries and the code
that they may generate but you should be
curious inspect anything especially if
you're working with JavaScript since
things are quite easy to inspect and
quite dynamic if you're interested in
knowing the specifics of what each of
these methods or properties represents I
recommend reading the API documentation
on the temple jas site</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
