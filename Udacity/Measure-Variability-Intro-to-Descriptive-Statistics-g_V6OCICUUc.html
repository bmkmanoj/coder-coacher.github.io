let's say you had just three data values
we'd find the distance between this and
this and then we'd find the distance
between this and this and then we'd find
the distance between this and this and
the distance between this one and this
one and finally the distance between
this one and this one the distance
between this one and this one so we've
calculated six distances now imagine if
we were to add another data set then we
would calculate six more distances the
distance between this and this this and
this and those two and then the distance
from this point to all the others now
imagine if we had 1,000 data values
which is very typical for a data set
this one just isn't feasible there are
way too many things to calculate okay so
what if we found the average distance
between each data value and either the
max or the min if we had four data
values and we chose the min we would
only have to find three distances well I
guess four actually including the minute
itself but what have we had an outlier
what if we had a value all the way out
here or even further then the distance
of each from the outlier would be really
far and it wouldn't matter how closely
grouped these were one outlier would
cause a huge variability so this one
doesn't work either
however the mean is a really good
reference point because it's in the
middle of the data and the mean takes
every data value into account so this is
our best bet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
