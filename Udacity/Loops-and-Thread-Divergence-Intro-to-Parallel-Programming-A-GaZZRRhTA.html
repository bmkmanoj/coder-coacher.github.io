these four loops and decide how many
times each warp is going to have to
execute the for loop and that means how
many times at least one thread in the
warp is going to have to execute it so
looking at this expression here for a
single warp these values will vary from
0 to 31 so there will be at least one
thread in that warp for whom this modulo
expression evaluates to 31 and that
means that the entire warp is going to
go through the motions of executing this
bar function 31 times now some of those
times some of the threads will be
deactivated
so the very first time thread 0 will not
execute the bar function it'll be
deactivated because I will not be less
than 0 and the next time thread 0 &amp;amp; 1
will be deactivated and so forth
ultimately the total amount of time that
the warp has to spend in this loop
depends on the total number of time that
any one thread has to spend on it
each warp will execute this loop 31
times this next loop that was different
in this case the integer divide means
that threads 0 through 31 are going to
evaluate to 0 this expression will
evaluate to 0 and therefore they're not
going to execute the bar function at all
and in threads 32 through 63 will
evaluate this expression for 1 and they
will execute the loop once and so forth
so there'll be one warp which evaluates
at zero times one warp which evaluates
at one time one that evaluates at two
times and so forth all the way up to a
single warp which evaluates at 31 times
so the average number of times that all
of the warps will execute this loop is
15.5 so now we know what we need to know
to answer the question clearly the
second loop will execute faster and
it'll be twice as fast because on
average the number of times that the
expensive bar function gets evaluated is
half the number of times that that bar
function gets evaluated during the first
loop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
