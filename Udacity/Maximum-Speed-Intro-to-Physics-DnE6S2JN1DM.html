problem was to draw a force diagram so
we know the force of gravity is pulling
down on the car like we'd expect and
there's some normal force pointing
upwards and since the car is and
accelerating vertically we know these
two bit forces must balance each other
out perfectly and of course we have the
frictional force which we've said is
equal to B V squared and we've got the
force that the car is producing to make
it go forward and this force is actually
produced by the road pushing up on the
wheels by Newton's third law the wheels
pushed on the ground and the ground
pushes back up on the wheels causing the
car to move forward and we know that if
the car is going at its maximum speed
and can't go any faster then these two
forces should be perfectly balanced too
so we can say that this force here
equals this force over here so starting
with the equation for work I divide both
sides by delta T and you'll note that
this term Delta D the change in position
over the change in time well that's just
the same as velocity and also over here
worked or divided by change in time
that's just the same thing as power so
we get this nice equation that power is
equal to the force pushing the car
forward times its velocity now what's
this F equal to well we said earlier
that this F has to perfectly balance out
the frictional force so we know that the
frictional force is equal to be V
squared so we can just plug that in and
multiplying that by the V we get that
the power is equal to be V cubed and
solving for velocity we get that the
velocity required to go at a constant
speed at a certain power is equal to the
cube root of the power divided by that
constant B and plugging in the numbers
we were given it turns out that 150
horsepower is equal to 111 thousand
watts we get that the maximum speed you
can go is 103 point eight meters per
second and if you're curious that's
about equal to 232 miles per hour of
course in the real world we're not just
dealing with air friction we're dealing
with all sorts of friction so this value
might be a little higher than you'd
expect but if you got this value
congratulations on solving the problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
