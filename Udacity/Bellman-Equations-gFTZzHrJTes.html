reinforcement learning for control and
using reinforcement learning without
control is basically whether or not
there's actions that are being chosen by
the learner and so just to make that
make sense I'm gonna let's swap back in
the notion of bellman equation so this
is the bellman equations without actions
this is what we've been talking about
for the last few videos do you recognize
the bellman equation value of a state is
the reward plus the discounted expected
value of the next state yeah I mean
usually you write that within an a in
there right right but I I said no
actions okay we're gonna put an a back
in in just a moment okay that'll make me
feel better certainly when we were
talking about TD we didn't really have
much of a notion of actions we were
really talking about sequence of states
that were being experienced and the
rewards associated with them and in fact
the the update rule that we talked about
this is this is one of the update rules
that we talked about says that if we go
from some state and we get some reward
and we end up in some new state then
what we're going to do is our new value
function estimate is going to be the
well it's going to be the same as the
old one except for in the state that we
just left we're we're gonna move a
little bit towards the reward we got
plus our prediction our discounted
prediction of the state that we just
landed it so so what update rule is this
of the different update rules we talked
about PD zero yeah TD zero factorial so
what we need to do now is get control
back into the picture here and so we're
gonna we're gonna do that now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
