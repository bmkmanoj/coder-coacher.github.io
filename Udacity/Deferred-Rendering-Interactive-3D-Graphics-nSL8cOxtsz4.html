lights to a scene is the expense every
light you add means yet another light
that must be evaluated for the surface
one way around this is deferred
rendering look at this demo there are 50
lights in the scene and it runs just
fine
normally you render a surface and the
fragment color for each pixel is stored
if it's the closest visible object this
is often called forward rendering in a
deferred rendering algorithm you instead
store data of some sort at each pixel
there are many variations with names
such as deferred shading versus deferred
lighting and here's just one you could
store the position normal and material
color and shininess of the closest
surface at each pixel you also drawn to
the z-buffer as usual I'm not going to
get into the details of how you store
these various pieces of data the point
is that you can do so it's just image
data in another format with deferred
rendering every point light in the scene
has an upper limit as to how far its
light goes this distance forms a sphere
so a sphere is drawn in a special way
for each light another way of saying
this is that each light can affect a
volume in space whatever surfaces we
find inside the sphere are affected by
the light each light affects a fairly
small number of pixels on the screen
namely whatever area the light sphere
covers this means that a huge number of
lights with the limited radius can be
evaluated in this way by drawing a
sphere we're telling the GPU which
pixels on the screen are covered by the
light and so should be evaluated their
variance on what shapes you draw a
circle a screen aligned rectangle
whatever is drawn the idea is that the
geometries purpose is to test only the
limited set of pixels potentially in
range of the light this is as opposed to
standard lights where every light is
evaluated for every surface at every
pixel I hope this gives you a flavor of
how deferred rendering works I'm really
jumping the gun here you need to know
about shader programming to implement
these but the idea is to treat Lights as
objects that are rendered into the scene
after all object surface values are
recorded there are some problem cases
for deferred rendering techniques such
as transparency but it offers a way to
have an incredible number of Lights in a
scene</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
