spatial knowledge by itself suffices to
an illogical reasoning under certain
conditions now let us look at a
different problem you certainly are
situations where we might want a agents
to be able to extract propositional
representations your projects one two
and three did exactly that one task
where an air agent might want to build
propositional representations out of
visuospatial knowledge is when an agent
is given a design drawing so here is a
vector graphics drawing of a simple
engineering system perhaps some of you
can recognize what is happening here
this is the cylinder and this is the
piston this is the rod of the piston the
piston moves left and right the other
end of the rod is connected to a
crankshaft as this piston moves left and
right this particular crankshaft starts
moving anti-clockwise this device
translates linear motion into rotational
motion I just gave you a cause or
account all the causality was only
implicit in this visual spatial
knowledge you and I were able to extract
a causal account out of this how did we
do it how can we help err 80s do it at
present if you would make a CAD drawing
using any cut tool that you want the
machine does not understand it drawing
but can machine so tomorrow understand
drawings by automatically building these
causal models out of them put another
way there is a story that is been
captured in this particular diagram can
a machine automatically extract that
story from this diagram in 2007 Patrick
yanar build an AI program called are
cheetahs are cheetahs was able to
extract causal models out of vector
graphics drawings of the kind that I
just showed you this figure is coming
from paper and are cheetahs and hence
the form of the figure will have a
pointer to the paper in the notes this
is how are cheetahs worked it began with
the library of source drawings these
were drawings that are already knew
about for each drawing it already knew
about it already had done this
segmentation these basic shapes for
example might be things like circles and
composite shapes which were then labeled
like piston and cylinder then a
behavioral model or a causal model which
said what happens when the piston moves
in and out namely the crankshaft turns
and then a functional specification
which said that this particular system
converts linear motion into rotational
motion so there was a lot of knowledge
associated with each previous drawing
that artistas already had seen all of
this knowledge was put into a library
when a new drawing was input into
artistas then it generated drying
segments and arcs and intersections from
it and then it started mapping them to
the lines and segments and arcs of
previously known drawings retrieve the
drawing that was the closest matching
drawing to a new drawing and then
started transferring basic shapes and
then composite shapes and it transferred
each element through this abstraction
hierarchy all the way up to the
functional level as an example if
artistas library contain piston and
crankshaft drawing fractures along with
causal functional models for them then
given a new drawing of a piston
crankshaft device artistas would then be
able to assemble a causal functional
model for the new drawing this artistas
extracted causal information from visual
spatial representations through
analogical reasoning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
