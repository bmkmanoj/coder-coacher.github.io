understandable because we've been
working on this code for a while but if
you take a step back and try looking at
it as if you're a new developer to the
project this code isn't all that
semantic it doesn't describe what it is
what if we could replace all this code
with this with ember we can this is a
special kind of expression called a
component a component is powered by its
own template and javascript file let's
create this menu item component a
requirement for components is that their
name has to have a dash in it so we
can't create an item component so let's
name it menu item instead this creates
the component file that lives in the
components directory and a template file
for the component that lives in the
components directory which is in
templates converting this code to a
component will take several steps first
we need to move the HTML from here to
here then we need to call the component
think of a component as a closed box or
no information from the outside world
can get in so even though we're using
the item variable here this item doesn't
have any connection with this one so all
of these lookups fail we need to pass
the variable on the outside to the one
on the inside there now the item inside
the component has its data pests in from
the outside and just so you know these
two don't need to be the same thing I
could have named this one food and
updated all of these two food too and
now this would still work we still have
one last step to completely transition
to using this component components are
like custom HTML elements and have a
default Dom element of a div we need to
update that to a list item in the
component file we need to add a tag name
property instead of 2 l.i since the list
item also has a class we can give the
component of class with the class names
array the component will now
automatically be rafted in li with this
class so we can remove them from the
template now we have a more semantic and
descriptive menu template if a new
developer comes along they'll easily be
able to understand what's going on and
if they want to alter what hTML is being
used for this menu item there's a
dedicated template for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
