is unstable and the last one is stable
again why why is that the case mmm
assume that we are close to zero so that
we have a small amount of fish then this
harvesting rate is going to quickly
reduce that amount 20 again which makes
zero stable by the way we can't approach
zero from the other side there won't be
any negative amount of fish the second
equilibrium is unstable imagine that we
had a little less fish then we would
harvest more than we gained in a
specific period which means we are going
to further drive down the number they
are moving away from that equilibrium
similarly if we have a little more fish
then the growth rate exceeds the
harvesting rate we are going to have
even more fish so in both directions we
are moving away from the equilibrium
it's unstable another third equilibrium
if you have a little less fish the
growth rate the green curve exceeds the
harvest rate more growth then harvest we
are going to end up with even more fish
we're moving up on the horizontal axis
towards the equilibrium if we have a
little more fish the harvest rate
exceeds the growth rate we are fishing
more then we gain which drives down the
amount so from both sides we are going
to approach this equilibrium which makes
it stable if we are in this region we
are definitely overfishing the amount of
fish is going down all of the time
towards zero the harvesting rate is way
too large for that small amount of fish
that we have in this region</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
