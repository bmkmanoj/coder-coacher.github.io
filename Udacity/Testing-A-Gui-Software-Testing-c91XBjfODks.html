so we're going to be testing some sort
of a graphical application so we have a
GUI application that's our software
under test and so we have to ask
yourself what's the domain and range of
a graphical user application well the
domain that is to say the set of legal
inputs is basically just going to be the
set of all possible GUI actions so mouse
clicks keyboard events swipes etc and
the range is going to be possible states
of the GUI application so now it should
go without saying that the the size of
the domain here that is to say the size
of the set of all possible GUI inputs is
really pretty gigantic there are a lot
of possible combination of inputs and so
now I have a quiz question for you and
the question is what constitutes a set
of good test inputs for a GUI
application so answer a is just use the
application normally answer B is but a
four-year-old use the application for a
while
answer C is use some sort of a tool to
inject a stream of fake gooey events
that is to say a stream of automatically
generated keyboard events mouse clicks
and similar in answer D is reproduced
gooey inputs that is to say mouse clicks
and such the crashed or previous version
or software so go ahead and write all of
the answers that apply in the textbox
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
