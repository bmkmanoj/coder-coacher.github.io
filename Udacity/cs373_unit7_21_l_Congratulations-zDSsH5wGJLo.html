so you and take you in this last class
on a little trip to what a do day in day
out which is work with the Google
self-driving car project but more
importantly I just want to just discuss
a little bit of the topics we actually
covered in class and remind you what you
actually learned you probably started
out being good and programming in linear
algebra and probability and hopefully
you weren't quite an expert in robotics
because if you were i probably didn't
teach you very much but in seven weeks
time we went through all the basics
elements of making AI for robotics and
specifically how to program robotica now
we learned about localization monteclaro
localization which also called histogram
filters a way to deal with probabilities
in a large-scale situation we talked
about tracking other cars we talked
about something called Kalman filters
which is a Gaussian version of the same
idea very different math in fact it took
me myself many many months to get
commentators so hopefully you you
understood a good chunk of it we learned
about a really nifty type of F I hadn't
called particle filters which is really
easy to implement and a lot of fun for
again for state estimation problems like
localization and tracking other cars we
moved into planning we talked about
multiple planning paradigms one called a
star punkin dynamic programming with
different trade-offs some of them
handled uncertainty differently from
others we also looked into controls and
we looked into smoothing we talked about
PID control of course you remember what
that means and we all implement it may
be somewhat simplified yet really
important versions of self-driving car
problems what's really important to me
is that you implemented this it wasn't
just me implementing it but through this
class hopefully you gained the skill and
the confidence to take these methods
into practice and implement them and
understand them not just theoretically
but following a professor explaining
them but by you being able to bring them
to the world and if you are able to do
this and you can solve an interesting
problem please do drop me an email I
really care about this I really care
enriching your life and empowering you
in the ability to carry out these
methods anywhere you go I want to thank
all of you for sticking with me through
this I know this is a substantial time
commitment you aren't quite done yet we
have the final exam coming up the type
final exam questions are similar to the
questions that we discussed in class but
they are also different yeah some of
them are challenging there's at least I
believe to challenge questions in there
there's also a programming thing in
there so you can go wild I hope you have
sufficient time to do this I think
whispering entire week for the final
exam but because the final exam is taken
separately I want to say goodbye I love
you guys and girls you've done amazingly
well thanks for sticking with me come
back to get a CT and take classes with
us again and hopefully I can help you
and we can help yet Udacity to become
stronger and to become more skilled and
find better jobs thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
