use a lot more computation and use it
profitably and actually see the
difference so one of the questions I
always ask my students when I'm teaching
is what are you gonna do with a hundred
times more compute power so how about in
the more you know high performance
computing arena and what our people are
going to do with a hundred times more
flops well some there are some problems
which have limitless amounts of
computational need things like by
understanding disease you know the the
work being done by folks like Vijay
Pandey at Stanford where you're trying
to simulate the actual progression of a
cell as it gets attacked in the disease
he's got a project working on
Alzheimer's where he's trying to
actually witness a nerve cell and watch
a nerve cell died at the atomic level
you know simulating every gene and
protein and cell membrane as it gets
infected and and and it eventually
deteriorates just think how many atoms
are in a cell and simulating that and
there in real time or at least in a
timeline where you can actually
understand disease down to the actual
chemical level it's really gonna provide
a cool breakthrough for how we treat
those things and understand the path
with a very complicated pathways and
then design the right kind of drug that
can get in there and stop it at the
right point and keep people healthy I
think that's one of the one of them are
cooler things we're going to be doing in
computers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
