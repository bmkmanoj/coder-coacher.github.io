about applying the negative sign to both
the X and the 9 when we're talking about
subtracting expressions from one another
what we're really doing here is using an
example of a much broader property and
that property is the distributive
property so we're distributing this
negative sign to both the X and the 9
when we say that we want to subtract
them both from the 4 so I'm going to
show you a slightly different way of
looking at how to distribute that
negative sign and what distributing a
negative sign really means first things
first we know that when we subtract like
we're doing here that's actually the
same as adding the negative of the thing
that you want to subtract so for example
if we have 5 minus 3 that's actually
equal to 5 plus negative 3 now that may
seem like we're working backwards but
hang in there this is going to be
helpful so let's do the same thing here
this is equal to 4 plus the negative of
this entire quantity
however when we're taking the negative
of something or really doing is
multiplying it by negative 1 so in order
to get negative 3 we actually have to
say negative 1 times positive 3 so that
means that if we want negative x plus 9
we actually need negative 1 times X plus
9 you'll notice that I didn't write a
multiplication sign between this
coefficient negative 1 and the
parentheses that surround X plus 9
because remember there's an invisible
multiplication sign implied between
those when there's no space between them
so I'll just get rid of that so here
it's a bit easier to see explicitly why
the distributive property is being
applied in this case we have a negative
1 that we're multiplying each term
inside the parentheses by so both X and
negative 9 are each being multiplied by
negative 1 the distributive property
basically says that if you have some
number or variable let's call it a and
you want to multiply that by some number
of terms that are inside parentheses
let's just pick two to be simple and
call them B and C and we'll just add
them although of course C could be
negative I need to be subtracting or B
could be negative if you want to get rid
of the parentheses you'll end up with a
being multiplied by each of these terms
so the a multiplied is the B and that's
added to a times C as well so you can
see why we use the word distribute here
the multiplication of the a affects the
B and also affects the C so we have a
times
the original operator that was between B
and C the plus sign a times C so if we
use that property in this case we leave
our four plus and then we have negative
one times X right the sign that's
between the two terms inside the
parentheses negative one times nine
however we know that negative one times
X is just minus X and negative one times
nine is also just minus nine so we end
up with four minus X minus nine and that
is actually what's happening when we are
a quote-unquote distributing this minus
sign to both terms in here and then of
course we could rearrange and simplify
again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
