interfaces for the mark for that inherit
from or implement our abstract classes
we can also factor out the specific
communication mechanisms by which the
sensors are access have a look at
Martin's specific java implementation
which is provided on the class resources
page so for the part about we could
either inherit or implement these
abstract classes for design would I
guess a situation for in for inheriting
the abstract classes if we want to
define some more policies about maybe a
particular class of coffee makers like
we have for instance our containment
vessel and it has these abstract of
things that the containment vessel the
concrete classes would need to provide
and then we have a maybe a slew of
coffee makers that have this style of
containment vessel that's a little bit
more particular but still we want to
have another kind of inherited abstract
class and not like an implemented
concrete class so let me let me comment
a little bit and then see if you we can
refine the question here a little bit
okay so different object-oriented
languages provide different capabilities
for doing refinement okay Java has both
interfaces and subclasses but it only
has single inheritance okay c++ has
multiple inheritance but it doesn't have
interfaces although they both have
abstract classes so when I when I said
about inherit or implement I was really
being you know generic across the
programming languages okay but in
general inherit sorry implementation of
abstract interfaces is nice because in
the abstract interface you've captured
something that is purely abstract in an
abstract class you can also have
concrete methods okay so if it's purely
abstract you really captured the essence
of something so and we could even
imagine a situation where each of the
roles
that is expressed by a class is defined
in a separate in a separate interface so
we might have a relatively vanilla class
that that implements three roles okay
and just provide the details of doing
that and then if we wanted to change one
of the roles or one of the use cases we
just can go look at that one particular
interface so given that you want to
react your question I think that covers
kind of my my question I guess I have a
better understanding I think now I guess
the the takeaway seems to be that with a
very abstractly to find a system like
this it's kind of like saying well I
don't care how you provide the Israeli
function for the containment vessel as
long as whatever you implement provides
it is going to fit with this abstract
definition of how our system works so
you should be able to extend and have
some kind of wild and crazy thing that
does is ready or maybe you're more
typical mark for design of how the
container vessel becomes is ready so so
one way of thinking about this is you're
really at this stage designing policy
and that policy can take the form of
protocols that is the names of the
abstract methods that have to be called
okay and the the attitude here is to be
as abstract as possible or at least the
more abstract you are the more flexible
you are with changes in the future of
course you can go overboard if you're
only you know ever going to have one
version of this thing you might not want
to spend a lot of time abstracting on it
and maybe there's a sweet spot in in
between but in general and and
reflecting back on some of what we've
talked about earlier with respect to
maintain ability of the modules and so
on you want to provide as much
abstractness as you can in support of
eventual reuse</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
