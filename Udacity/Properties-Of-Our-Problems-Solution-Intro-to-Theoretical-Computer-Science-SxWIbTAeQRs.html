know a lot so you know all of these
problems here to be np-complete which
you probably didn't know before taking
this course we've also investigated
intelligent search trees for vertex
cover and four clique and independent
set we unfortunately we're not able to
find one for shortest tour but we know
143 sat we talked about pre-processing
for vertex cover and we talked about
pre-processing for three set and we
showed that vertex cover is fixed
parameter tractable using the size of
the solution and we showed that shortest
tour could be fixed parameter tractable
as well as 3sat using a measure known as
distance from triviality we also talked
about the constant factor approximation
algorithm for vertex cover we showed
that there is no such algorithm four
clique and independent set we had a
constant factor approximation algorithm
for shortest tour we did not touch upon
3 set unfortunately here regarding a pts
we know there's none available for
vertex cover we also know there's none
available for clique and independent set
unless P equals NP we mentioned briefly
that there might be some available for
special cases of shortest tour but not
in the general case also not for 3 set
then we have the Monte Carlo algorithm
for 3 set we did not go much into Las
Vegas algorithms here but what we then
also did we mentioned that all of these
problems here are usually much better
solvable in practice then the worst case
analysis and their NP completeness
suggests now compare this table of
knowledge with what the four computer
scientists and you knew before taking
this course and I think you now know a
lot about challenging problems but also
about the techniques that you can use to
solve them so it's of course not all
good news because in general these
problems are hard but using this arsenal
of techniques here you'll usually be
able to do something about them in
practice as others have before you and I
think that can really really really make
you stand out among other computer
scientists because not many computer
scientists understand the concept of
np-completeness alone but even those
that do once they encounter an
np-complete problem they will tend to
just give up or use some random
algorithm not a randomized one a random
one where as you now know about these
two
niques here and can use them to try and
tackle those problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
