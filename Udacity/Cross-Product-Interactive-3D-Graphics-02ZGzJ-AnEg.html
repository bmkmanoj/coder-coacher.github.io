look at and think about what access to
rotate around however we usually won't
be able to do this if I gave you two
arbitrary vectors and said quick what's
the axis of rotation best of luck to you
I sure couldn't do it happily there's an
easy way to get the axis of rotation and
it's called the cross product in three
jsut call it like this it takes two
vectors as its inputs and the result is
put into the vector three itself the
third vector is in fact the axis of
rotation or at least one of them the
direction is determined by the
right-hand rule you wrap your hand from
the first vector in this case our
cylinder to the second vector in this
case the y-axis this then points along
the axis of rotation if we computed the
cross product of these two vectors in
the opposite order we would go from the
y-axis to the cylinders vector and would
get the opposite rotation axis recall
how the dot product gives us the cosine
between two vectors the length of the
cross product result is in fact
proportional to the sine of the angle
between the two vectors there is one
special case I'm going to point out and
it's kind of a headache if the cross
product gives back a vector that is of
length zero or nearly so then the two
vectors are either pointing in the same
direction or in directly opposite
directions you can use the dot product
of the two vectors to figure out which
if they point in the same direction then
you're done you don't need to rotate at
all if they point in exactly opposite
directions then you need to rotate 180
degrees however the rotation axis you'll
get back from the cross product is
actually zero zero zero which is no
access at all at this point you
basically need to choose some arbitrary
axis that is perpendicular to your
vectors and use that for rotation or
just form the rotation matrix directly
here for example I use the x-axis since
I know Y is going to be perpendicular to
it see the additional course materials
on a good way to solve this problem in
general the mathematical notation for a
cross product is this a big X the length
of the vector produced by the cross
product is equal to the sine of theta
that's the angle between the two vectors
times the length of a time's the length
of B the cross product itself is
computed by multiplying neighboring
elements of the two vectors coordinates
for the x coordinate we multiply a Y
times BZ and then subtract AZ times B Y
for the y coordinate we multiply AZ
times BX minus ax times BZ I like to do
this kind of X cross thing here as we
did before so I tend to take this and
wrap it around to this side so it's AZ
times BX and ax times BZ for the last
coordinate we do the same thing ax times
B y minus a y times BX at the end we
have a vector that describes the axis of
rotation from one vector to the other
and in fact this vector will be
perpendicular to both of these two oh
and one more thing if you want to use
this vector later you're probably going
to want to normalize it because its
length will be pretty obscure</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
