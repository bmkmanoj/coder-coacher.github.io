memory is the program's is a huge amount
of memory and usually some contiguous
regions of this memory are actually used
by the program and there is an enormous
region in the middle between the heap
and the stack that the program will
never access unless the keep grows that
way but the heap is usually small
relative to how much space we have here
because it's a huge huge amount of
memory so what happens is the program
thinks it has a lot of memory but in
reality most of that memory it will
never access and this is what we call
virtual memory so the program virtually
has a lot of memory but in practice
there isn't that much memory another
program has its own virtual memory let's
say it's a small program so it's using
less memory and less for the stack so it
has more memory here that it's not
really using but the idea that the
program has about this memory is that it
can always use more so this is the
virtual memory of one program this is
the virtual memory of another program
they might be running at the same time
let's say this is our physical memory we
need to figure out what happens when
this program generates an address that
should access this memory location how
do we find where in here do we actually
go and if this program accesses a memory
location with the same address how do we
figure out where does it go it might go
to a different place in the physical
memory for example when these programs
have nothing to do with each other it
might go to the same place in the
physical memory for example if these
programs are sharing data in fact data
sharing among programs is not
constrained so that you have to put the
data in the same virtual address you
could easily allocate this here and then
let this program share it but as far as
this program
concern it's here it still needs to map
to the same location so how do we
reconcile these different possibilities</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
