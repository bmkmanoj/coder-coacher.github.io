data it's something that's come up in
this class already but let's make it a
little bit more explicit so that you
know that it's something to look out for
here are a few important types of data
that you should be aware of one is
numerical so something like salary
information would be an example of a
numerical variable where basically the
feature is a number another thing that
we've talked a lot about in the context
of supervised classification is
categorical features these can take on a
limited number of discrete values so a
cat an example of a categorical feature
would be the class label this would also
be something like if a person is a man
or a woman or maybe how many stars you
give when you're rating a movie all
those stars you might argue could also
be called a numerical value another one
that's very important especially in
particular fields like finance is time
series data this is data that has a
temporal value attached to it so this
would be something like a date or a
timestamp that you can look for trends
in time one that we're already very
familiar with text data which is
basically just words a lot of the time
the first thing that you do with text is
you turn it into numbers using some
interesting functions that will that
will learn about things like the bag of
words formulation so these are all types
of data that you might encounter and
depending on exactly the type of data
this might have some repercussions for
the type of algorithm that you can use
or the type of questions that you can
ask of it so let me give you a quiz just
to practice this I'm going to give you a
bunch of types of features you might see
and ask you what type of data that
feature is first example is salary
information would you call this
numerical categorical time series text
or let's put other on the list as well
because this isn't a complete list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
