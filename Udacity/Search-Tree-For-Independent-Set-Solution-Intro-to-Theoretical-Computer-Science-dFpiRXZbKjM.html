difficult to find this one is true the
rules of an independent set are that two
vertices cannot be connected by an edge
if they are part of the independent set
and that means if we were to put this
one into the independent set as well as
this one here then we would have an
error here which automatically also
answers the second question it's not the
case that both vertices can be in the
independent set because they are
connected to each other this one here
might have been a little bit more tricky
so at least one of the two vertices must
be in the independent set now you might
be inclined to think that because we are
looking for a maximum size independent
set but actually that is not the case
and I will give you a little example for
that so say we have a very small network
like this one here and here you have V
here you have you then this network here
has an independent set of size 2
actually it has a number of independent
sets of size 2 but there's also one
independent set of size 2 where V and
you are both excluded this is a bit
different from vertex cover because you
can actually have the case that both
vertices are not part of the set even
though they are connected by an edge so
this is false both be and you could be 0
yes this is exactly what is also shown
by this example you can have the case
that both are not part of the
independent set so this is definitely a
yes here do we have to set both vertices
20 no this is also not the case because
for example you could also have a
independent set here that you
constructed this way you put you in and
this one out so now we have also found a
maximum size independent set but we have
included one of the two vertices so this
one here is clearly also not true if you
take all of those observations together
it's pretty cool because this now gives
us a new search tree strategy that is
actually quite similar to vertex cover
so we have our two vertices being you
here just as we did with vertex cover we
can spread into three different
possibilities the first one is we take V
into the independent set but not you the
second one is exactly the other way
around we do not take V that we take you
and finally it is possible that both are
excluded as long as we find an edge
between two vertices v and u for which
we has no assignment yet and you has no
assignment yet then we can branch into
exactly three possibilities
now what happens if either V or you
already has an assignment for vertex
cover I told you what would happen then
this time I will let you figure this out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
