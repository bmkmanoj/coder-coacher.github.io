and third no us hardly ever a good
answer to a question about is there any
possible way to break something the way
the adversary will learn that Dave and
Alice are communicating is if there's a
way to match up the messages at the
endpoints so this would be the case if
there's no other traffic that looks
similar on the network these messages
aren't the same remember that they're
encrypted in different ways that this
message will not look similar to message
one but they'll both be encrypted
messages they might be similar because
of the length there might be things the
adversary can do to adjust the timing
remember this is not a direct link so
the adversary if there are many messages
going between Alice and Bob could
introduce delays in the messages and see
the same pattern of delays on the
upcoming messages that would work if
there weren't any unpredictable Layton
sees inside the network so if there's
any way for the adversary to correlate
those incoming and outgoing messages
then the aversive would know these two
parties are communicating if the
adversary can see all the traffic on the
network this would be a very powerful
adversary well that's not enough unless
they can correlate it so even if an
adversary could see all the messages
coming in are two if there's many other
messages coming into our two at the same
time and many other messages going out
of our two if the adversary can't
connect the ones coming in with the ones
coming out well then they wouldn't be
able to follow the chain so in order for
this to be secure we need to know that
there's a lot of other traffic on the
network that looks similar so you'd like
to know that between all of these
writing points there's always message is
going they look similar lengths similar
timings there's no way to correlate the
messages that come in to one router with
the messages that go out from another
one so this is the one of the things
that you need to do to make a network
like this secure is to make sure that
there's enough traffic you can inject a
lot of fake traffic that's expensive
you're wasting bandwidth on things that
don't go and you've also got to be
careful to make the fig traffic look
like real traffic so you can't just send
random packets if there aren't
correlations between those packets and
if you're not sending a full flow well
then that could be detected by the
adversary so the lots of hard problems
to solve to make this secure there's a
very successful project that provides
this as a service on the internet
it's called tour you can download it as
an extension to your web browser it
provides a way to connect to a web site
without revealing to the website where
you're connecting from you need to get a
response as well and so that means in
addition to sending selecting the route
for reaching the website you need to
route for returning you don't want to
include your IP address so that would
reveal your location in the response but
you want to get the responses so so what
this does is select routes in both
directions selects a random set of
routers to reach the website that you
want to communicate with as well as a
way for that to send a response along
another random path</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
