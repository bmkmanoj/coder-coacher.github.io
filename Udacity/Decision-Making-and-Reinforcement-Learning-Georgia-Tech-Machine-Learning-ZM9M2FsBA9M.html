diving into a particular formalism or
framework that I want to talk about that
we're going to use for most of this
mini-course or at least the first half
or so of it I want to remind everybody
what the differences are between the
three types of learning that we said we
were going to look at over this entire
course the you recall what they are well
reading off the slide supervised
unsupervised and reinforcement that's
right and you know again these things
are all strongly related to one another
but it's very useful to think about them
as being very separate so just as a
reminder supervised learning sort of
takes the form of function approximation
where you're given a bunch of XY pairs
and your goal is to find the function f
that will map some new X to a proper Y
you recall that yep unsupervised
learning is very similar to supervised
learning except that it turns out that
you're given a bunch of X's and your
goal is to find some F that gives you a
compact description of the set of X's
that you've seen so we call this
clustering or description as opposed to
function approximation and finally we're
getting to reinforcement learning
now reinforcement learning is actually a
name that means many things in different
fields and here we tend to talk about in
a relatively specific way and
superficially it looks a lot like
supervised learning and that we're going
to be given a string of pairs of data
and we're going to try to learn some
function but in the function
approximation case the supervised
learning case we are given a bunch of x
and y pairs we were asked to learn f but
in reinforcement learning we're going to
be given something totally different
we are instead going to be given X's and
Z's and I'll tell you what the X is and
the z stand for in a minute and then
we're going to have to learn some F that
is going to generate Y's and so even
though it's going to look a lot like
function approximation it's going to
turn out that it's going to have a very
different character and that's really
what the the next few slides a little
bit of discussion is really about is
understanding what that character is
you'll also notice from the title here
that I have decision-making
reinforcement learning and that's
because reinforcement learning is one
mechanism for doing decision-making and
again I'll define that in just a second
okay so you with me Michael I think
so should Y be circled because in some
sense you you underlined the things we
were given and you circled the things we
need to define so why is something that
we're gonna find right yeah I suppose I
like that all right interesting now it's
a beta
it's a Y trapped inside of a data and
it's yelling why I like that I'm a Y
trapped in a theta
mmm write a book about that okay good
that's a good point Michael so before we
were learning effectively trying to
learn one thing and here we're still
learning one thing because it's going to
produce another thing sort of
deterministically usually but it's worth
pointing out that we are going to be
figuring how to produce both of these
things as opposed to being given those
things good job okay so you ready to
move forward Michael with an example and
a quiz awesome excellent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
