a design money developer well we're
gonna go through four lessons the first
lesson is what is UX we're going to
learn about the difference between UI
and UX because there's a lot of
misinformation out there the second
lesson is about how to create
applications for specific users and
we're gonna use tools called personas
and use cases the third lesson is about
mobile design constraints because after
all this course is for mobile developers
and in Lesson four you're going to learn
how to leverage the power of the Android
platform to make applications that
Android users really love yeah in each
lesson you're going to be introduced to
new concepts and ideas that you will
have an opportunity to put into practice
at the end of every lesson in the form
of an assignment and the assignments are
going to be led by a Udacity course
designer named Andy hello Andy hey Andy
so now small let's briefly talk about a
few things that we're not going to cover
in this course so we're not gonna teach
you how to code your developers after
all in fact we have an Android class
made by Udacity the link is in the notes
below if you want to take that class and
we're also not going to cover any
Android specific UI elements so now
let's dive into what you're going to
learn in lesson one first we're going to
define what is user experience then
we're going to talk about the difference
between UI and UX then we're going to
give you two concrete examples of how
you can improve your apps today but
before we get to all this let's leave
the world of software design and I want
to show you a really awesome personal
example of something that captures
really amazing user experience design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
