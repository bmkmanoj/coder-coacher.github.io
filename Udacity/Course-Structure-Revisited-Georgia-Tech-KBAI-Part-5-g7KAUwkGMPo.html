topics in this course you may recall
this particular chart from the first
lesson let us go through each one of
these circles one by one and see the
connections between them so under
fundamentals we covered knowledge
representations like semantic networks
in fact we use semantic networks to
address 2 by 1 matrix problems then we
covered a series of problem solving
methods these were very
domain-independent general purpose
methods they did not use a lot of
knowledge but were very powerful
generated in test means and son alice's
in problem reduction then we turn to
production systems that are a specific
kind of cognitive architecture
production systems combined reasoning
learning and memory production systems
are both the technology for developing
air agents and a theory of human
cognition later we talked about planning
and in order to talk about planning we
first proposed a formal language for
discussing plans called formal logic we
learned about the different rules and
syntax used for writing formal logical
statements and learn why this is very
important that it allows agents to prove
the accuracy of their conclusions based
on a set of axioms that gave us a
language that we could then use to talk
about planning and as we found out
actually the origins of planning were an
agent's making proofs of why a certain
set of actions would lead to a certain
goal here we talked about both partial
order planning and hierarchical planning
which are two planning methods that
allow agents to make advance plans for
complex tasks and also allow us to
reflect on the way we ourselves plan our
actions in a complex environment under
common sense reasoning we colored
several important lessons frames
understanding common sense reasoning and
scripts frames is a structured knowledge
representation language that allows us
to do understanding understanding is
such a common everyday activity we are
trying to make sense of the world but
the world is ambiguous the word take for
example can have so many different
meanings we saw how frames allow us to
disambiguate different meanings of the
word take and a common sense reasoning
we made every day intuitive inferences
about the world around us well
understanding and common sense reasoning
were concerned with sentence level
understanding scripts is more concerned
about discourse level understanding
script is an even larger you just
structure knowledge representation than
frames
it to allows us to make sense of the
world around us both the physical world
and the social world frames also came up
in some of the other lessons in
particular they came up in the lesson
and production systems when we were
trying to represent episodic knowledge
they also came up in the lesson on
configuration when we were trying to
represent plans and the variables of
radius plant that can take values we
talked about learning in many lessons
throughout this course but certain
lessons were explicitly in solely
concerned with learning we started off
by talking about learning by recording
cases where an agent could build up a
case library of its own prior
experiences to use for future reasoning
that form the foundation of analogical
reasoning as well that we'll talk about
in a second we also talked about
incremental concept learning in version
spaces two different learning methods
for learning about information that's
coming in incrementally or bit by bit
that was one of our foundational
principles of this class we discussed at
the beginning in the war revisit in a
few minutes we also talked about
classification under learning which is
one of the most ubiquitous problems in
AI we talked about how classification
involves grouping large combinations of
percepts into equivalence classes to
allow for easier action selection
learning also came up in several other
lessons that we did throughout this
class including production systems case
based reasoning explanation based
learning analogical reasoning and
learning by correcting mistakes metairie
singh was also deeply connected to
learning where we could learn from our
own experiences by analyzing our own
prior thought processes as david just
said analogical reasoning is another
major topic connected with learning we
talked about learning by recording cases
will be simply assimilating cases by
recording them in a growing case library
as a new problem comes we use methods
like nearest neighbor to retrieve the
closest case and in work that case with
a new problem we talked about case based
reasoning and which we not only retrieve
the case but we also tweak it or modify
it in small ways in order to achieve a
new goal and exploration based learning
we saw how we could connect instances to
concept definitions with constructed
explanations that told us how instance
is an example of a given concept this
involved both abstraction and transfer
we also connected explanation based
learning to creativity analogical
reasoning made the role of abstraction
and transfer even more explicit we
talked about cross domain analogical
transfer for example from the solar
system to the atomic structure
we saw that when needed rich mental
models in order to be able to do an
illogical transfer we concluded the
lesson and our logical reasoning but
connecting it with an illogical design
or design by analogy analogical
reasoning too is closely connected to
creativity our discussion of visual
spatial reasoning started with our unit
on and strength propagation constraint
propagation was a very abstract in
general way of propagating constraints
to make sense of a new situation and it
comes up uniquely in visual reasoning
where we use line labeling to make sense
of 3d scenes even if they're presented
in 2d where we use line labeling to make
sense of three-dimensional scenes even
if they're presented in only two
dimensions we also saw how constraint
propagation could be used for natural
language understanding and we referenced
how we might also use it to understand
music or tactile information then in
visual spatial reasoning we expand on
these notions to discuss whether it
would be possible to reason about the
world without extracting propositions
this involved looking at scenes in the
world where there was no explicit
causality like a glass that's in spill
on the table we can infer what happened
but there's nothing in the visual scene
that tells us exactly how it arose
similarly we also discussed how this
could apply to other modalities like
tactile information or musical
information in the unit or design and
creativity we considered lessons on
configuration diagnosis design and
creativity you may recall it in
configuration we were worried about very
routine everyday kind of designs and we
did that kind of design by having a
library of plans at different levels of
abstraction we selected a plan at a high
level abstraction assign values to some
of the variables and then refine the
plan to the next low level abstraction
all the components were known we had to
decide on the arrangement of the
components in configuration and
diagnosis we were given data about a
malfunctioning system and we had to
identify default responsible for that
malfunctioning we took two views of
diagnosis classification and abduction
in the classification view this data was
mapped into equivalence classes that
acted like hypotheses for this data in
abduction we composed this elementary
hypothesis into a composite hypothesis
that could best explain the entire data
design thinking referred to thinking
about problems that are ill-defined and
open-ended under
and Design Thinking is a problem and
solution often kowal the problem does
not remain fixed the solution evolves
but that interns it leads to improved
understanding of the problem both of our
understanding of the problem and
solution evolve together with
characterized creativity in terms of the
novelty value and the non-obvious pneus
of the results we discussed it criteria
under which we would consider an agent
to be creative and we saw how many of
the techniques that we have learned in
this particular class can compose the
fundamental processes of creativity like
analogical reasoning like visual spatial
reasoning like meta reasoning then we
close the class by talking about
metacognition metacognition enable
agents to reason about their own
reasoning or think about their own
thinking or have knowledge of their own
knowledge base we started off by talking
about learning by correcting mistakes or
an agent could look at a mistake it's
made in the past isolate the mistake
explain the mistake and then fix the
mistake so it didn't happen again this
was one narrow instance of the broader
idea of meta reasoning in meta reasoning
we talked about how metacognition could
bring together many of the different
methods that we've talked about
throughout this class meta reasoning
enabled an agent to look at a new
problem and select which of its many
strategies would be best for addressing
that problem it also would allow an
agent to integrate multiple different
methods of reasoning at different levels
of abstraction we also talked about how
what meta reasoning operates is also the
way in which meta reasoning operates
meta reasoning can reason about case
based reasoning or it can reason using
case based reasoning it could for
example use production rules to conduct
case based reasoning in this way it
could integrate many different methods
at many different levels of abstraction
finally this set up a notion of ethics
and artificial intelligence as we're
building AI agents that start to have
real human level intelligence what are
the ethical issues what should we think
about replacing certain human jobs with
robots or what should we think about
developing robots that can interact with
us on everyday basis in the natural
world under what conditions would we
consider these agents to actually be
human like this summarizes 30 topics
that we covered in this class which is
quite a lot of course there is a lot
more to talk about each of these 30
topics than we have covered so far
therefore we have provided readings for
each of the topics and you're welcome to
pursue the readings for whatever topic
that interests you the most
