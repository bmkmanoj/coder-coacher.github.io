on the goal of running unmodified
operating systems instead the primary
goal is to offer a virtualization
solution that offers performance and
avoid some of the overheads that may be
associated with any of the complexities
that are necessary to support unmodified
guests in contrast to full
virtualization this is called para
virtualization with para virtualization
the guest OS is modified so that it now
knows that it's running in a virtualized
environment on top of a hypervisor as
opposed to on top of native physical
resources a pure virtualized guest OS
will not necessarily try to directly
perform operations which it knows that
they will fail and instead it will make
explicit calls to the hypervisor to
request the desired behavior or
specifically the desired Hardware
manipulations these calls to the
hypervisor are called hyper calls and
they behave in a way that's similar to
the way system calls behave in an
operating system so the unprivileged
guest OS here that's modified will
package all relevant information about
its context its current state and it
will specify the desired hyper call and
at that point it will issue the hyper
call and that will trap to the virtual
machine monitor when the hypervisor
completes the operation control will be
passed back to the virtual machine to
the guest in any data if appropriate
will be made available to it this
approach of pure virtualization was
originally adapted and popularized by
the Xen hypervisor this was a popular
virtualization solution and originally
was an open source hypervisor that
started as a research project at
University of Cambridge in the UK this
was later commercialized as Xen source
and Xen source is now owned by Citrix
but there still remains a lot of
activity in the open source and project
including at our own research group here
one thing to note however is that the
open source Xen version and the Citrix
and version have diverged perhaps
substantially over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
