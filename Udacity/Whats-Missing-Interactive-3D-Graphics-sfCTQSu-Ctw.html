is pretty trivial and easily handled an
empty scene is about the easiest thing
to render so this path is not a problem
the path from a light to any object to a
diffuse object is not well handled by
ray tracing from the eye if you r a
trace from the eye to the object you
don't know to shoot array in this
direction objects can be reflective but
when the lights contribution to a
visible surface is computed only pass
directly from the light to the surface
are checked so this answer is indeed
true it's ignored for this third path
imagine you're viewing the world from a
point on the surface if you think about
it just about every surrounding visible
object is reflecting light at the
surface not just the light sources in
the scene determining which paths could
possibly contribute more light as
difficult any pass from the light source
are ignored with classical ray tracing
as there are a huge number of them so
this case is ignored the fourth case is
easy to handle even rasterization
typically handles lights by giving them
a fixed solid color and classical ray
tracing can treat them in the same way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
