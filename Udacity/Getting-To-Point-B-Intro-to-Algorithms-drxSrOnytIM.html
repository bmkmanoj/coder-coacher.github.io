principal researcher at Microsoft
Research Silicon Valley and his work
focuses on creating algorithms for
real-world problems one of the
interesting problems he studied is how
to find the shortest path in really
really large networks in microseconds so
he's going to tell us a little bit about
algorithms for doing that recently I've
been working a lot on shortest a
sovereign especially motivated by to the
edge mitigation of applications so
basically how do we get from A to B
that's great so now how is how does when
you analyze this problem man at that
column itself is fairly classically
studied what are the new wrinkles in it
that come up and why do they come up so
the your income stream up when I to the
indication became very very widely used
and also today's math became
continent-sized and detailed digital
maps and then here we wanted to solve
the problem much faster than linear time
basically when you know bing maps google
maps gets a request that doesn't have
the time to look at the whole net so
linear time algorithm psychological
Dijkstra's algorithm are not good enough
and the new wrinkle was the processing
so you want to pre-process your graph to
be able to unsecured is are very very
quickly sort of in palo terrific times
you want to opportunity yet or during
last 15 years or so there was a lot of
research for side after our group and
also in the other places and so they
have been very nice algorithms developed
which ten years ago i wanted to leave
the disposable but basically these
algorithms can I unsecured it in
microseconds on continental size
networks
and it doesn't priest or all possible
pairwise north door just to give you a
gfx cannula and continent five network
has the tens of millions of nodes Wow so
Daniel is where is to be given for today
is huge but you are there any
relationships between the kinds of
graphs you get in highways and the kinds
of graphs that would come out of a
social network which is very very recent
studies on this edition now and we've
studied some of the publicly available
networks and please stop labeling our
advice when to talk about next has
actually worked fairly well for this
kind of network site for water networks
and so on but not publish doesn't work
so well for moral kind of networks okay
interesting all right good so if you
wouldn't mind telling me a little bit
about the the algorithm that I think
that would be really interesting so
let's talk about information just a
distance Oracle so basically given two
points you won't tell the distances in
this request so the algorithm first
through processes the graph and for its
relative compute label so let's say
simplicity the graphics undirected then
a label of vertex is the set of vertices
which we call hubs and distances to this
house from the vertex so these runtex
have a label okay and this label champ
must have the following property if you
take any two tortoises there are set of
hearts has to intersect and then
perception must contain the vertex on
the shortest artist in them
a connection to the Mayan importantly is
that but it's not that gives you some
off the distance is too little hot which
you have you will get the service
project somewhere there's also all all
hubs shortest path distances stored no
no for each project you have it at the
pub right give the pool from the vertex
booyah top oh I see oh and they're going
to stay set to share a hub on this then
is also on the shortest path I strike so
this is a feminist own property so the
easier way to do it is you say okay for
a short that whole lotta tortoises are
top then your damn damn property ate a
whole but then you're curious time is
Toto am right and what you really wanted
small labels and it turns out that some
drops have small label and the reason
why this works though on road networks
is that we can compute labels or say the
grapple person euro quiz about 18
million versus the contribute label of 5
about 70 70 70 yes out of how many
million did you say 16 million 18 18
million when are we going in 735 so if
you think about it if you're for this
have by no ladies we are to arrange and
you just need to intersect the storage
of 570 which you can do like a nerd
sources very cool ecology yes so just x
becomes below a microsecond wow you a
very variable but this is not a very
intuitive concept to me so what are
these 74 forgiven so now that we're
talking about you like individual
intersections in Europe right this is
like Piccadilly square or something like
that or this the northeast corner
Piccadilly Square and there's said you
only need to know from there set the
distance to 70 other places in Europe
this is amazing thing and that's why
people thought that this wouldn't be
practical to get
if you think about it all probably
thousands Roger surprising thing was
that only they're much smaller number so
if you think about it long range is
basically interceptions of major
highways okay and what's happening of
those transport of locally is the
processional state highways and no local
its intersection of major streets the
best grass for this kind of algorithms
agrees hi there are no decrease in the
match that even their our briefs like in
Manhattan it's only 10 are in his wife's
with what their deeds and there is
Broadway which raises in the tree so
things are not f dash I one might think
that's fascinating so of the seventy
places I can imagine that some fraction
of them are for real long distance
traveling between countries and some
other fraction of them are for more you
know within the country but far distance
and then another fraction of them are
for you know within the region of the
country and about how it is it is it
sort of equal buckets for each or for
really far distance you only need a
small number but for local you need more
like how what's the distribution life so
it's roughly uniform as you increase the
scale is financially wow wow that's this
really depends on way the country you
are okay because in that densely
populated area you need more local
things if you are in the middle of
nowhere there's only one way out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
