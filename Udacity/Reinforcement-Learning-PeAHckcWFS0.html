unsupervised learning there's a third
major school of thought machine learning
called reinforcement learning
reinforcement learning is inspired in
part by the behaviorist school of
thought and psychology and it's a way of
tweaking our system to prefer being
right or wrong in certain ways and so a
good way to think about this is with an
example think of a smart cab a
self-driving car it's learning how to
navigate roads learning how to transport
its passengers and it knows that there's
different ways it can be optimal it can
be optimal if it gets there in the
shortest amount of time it can also be
optimal if it gets there without
crashing but really we would want it to
prefer one of those definitions of
optimality way above the other one we
would much prefer it get there a couple
minutes later than it might have
otherwise then to actually get an
accident on the way we really want it to
prefer knocking in an accident to just
getting there as fast as possible so
reinforcement learning would be a way of
teaching the system to prioritize in
that way we attach rewards and
punishments to different outcomes and by
weighting those rewards and punishments
in the right way we can teach you the
right level of priority to assign to
different goals so in this case we would
assign a much bigger punishment to
getting an accident to just being a
couple minutes later than they could
have been otherwise so in this unit
we'll talk about reinforcement learning
and how augmenting the machine learning
process with these rewards and
punishments can really fundamentally
change the assistance understanding that
we generate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
