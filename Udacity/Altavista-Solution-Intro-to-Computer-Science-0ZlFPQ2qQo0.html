is also true that there's a small town
in Virginia named Alta Vista but the
relevant answer is the second choice
back in 1998 the most popular search
engine was probably the search engine
called Alta Vista they certainly had the
biggest web index at the time and they
also had great technology for responding
to queries quickly 1998 is the year that
Google was founded and most people
probably have not heard of Alta Vista
today and might have had a hard time
answering this quiz and the reason for
that is Google figure out a better way
to do page ranking and because of this
search engines that didn't have good
ways of ranking pages like Alta Vista
quickly became irrelevant and the
algorithm that I've described is the
algorithm that launched Google it's
called page rank and you may think the
page stands for web page the page
actually stands for Larry Page who was
the co-founder with Sergey Brin of
Google so that's the algorithm that
we've described and that's what allow
google to produce so much better search
results that other search engines at the
time I hope you remember Anna Patterson
from unit three and are still following
her advice to be polite on the web one
of the reasons Alta Vista started to
work so badly was because web sites were
not polite they tried to find ways to
game the rankings certainly this is
still something websites do today and
the way Alta Vista ranked pages it was
very easy to game them so the site that
would be ranked first was not the best
site about something but a site that was
best at gaming the rankings so I asked
Anna to explain why Google's page
ranking algorithm was so important to
the success of Google so page rank on
the web was a huge step forward I'm old
enough to actually remember the time
that google launched and you know it's
advanced / Alta Vista was Ulta bista was
very very prone to keyword stuffing spam
so if you said a restaurant 32 times
well you were better than a page that
said restaurant twice so PageRank came
out and actually gave a measure of
popularity or traffic and therefore the
things that said restaurant twice but
were awesome they wind up going to the
top certainly things have got more
complicated since then and there's more
things that go into the ranking out
than just what we've shown you but
that's the basic idea and the next thing
we're going to do is change our search
engine to implement this algorithm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
