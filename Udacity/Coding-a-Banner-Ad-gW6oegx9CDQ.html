banner ad this time let's build it into
an actual game that was built with
libgdx let's create a banner ad for the
game icicles where you just move your
player around and dodge icicles I
already have the code open for the game
icicles so let's change it a bit and add
a banner ad at the top of the screen the
first thing I've done is to include our
ads library and I've also updated our
Android manifest file to include the ad
activity and the permissions we'll need
so now we can access all the ad objects
we need and retrieve an ad to display
from the internet and now we're ready to
start programming a banner ad and we'll
be doing all of our ad programming in
our Android launcher class which
contains our on create method we'll be
treating this class like a view that we
can display ads in and to create our
initial view we'll need to change our
initialization code a little instead of
just saying initialize we're going to
create a view with initialize for view
we're going to create a view called game
view and then pass in the new icicles
game and config like we did before
great then next we need to do what we
did in our previous project which is to
register our app this lets us receive
ads and all use the same sample key I
did before next let's create our banner
ad the first step just like in our
interstitial ad project is to create a
private class variable but instead of an
interstitial ad this is going to be an
ad layout and I'll give it the name
banner add an interstitial ad
automatically took up the whole screen
but a banner ad only takes up a small
part and an ad layout object lets us
decide the size and placement of our ad
then I'll go back into our uncreate
method and make a new banner ad where I
say this activity dot banner ad variable
is equal to a new ad layout object next
we have to define where we want our ad
to appear in our game view to do this we
first have to define a relative layout
our relative layout which I've called
layout will include all the views and
layouts that appear on our screen so
it's going to include our game
view that we created here and our banner
ad ad layout to include these we need to
add them to our layout by saying layout
dot add view then giving our view
followed by the width and height we want
them to occupy first to add our game
view I'm going to specify width and
height that take up the whole screen and
since I want this to work across screens
big or small I'm going to use parameters
that Android provides to automatically
size our ad match parent will
automatically fit the whole screen so
since I want the game view to take up
the whole screen I'm going to say width
and height are both equal to match
parent then for my banner ad I'm going
to define the dimensions first I want it
to be as wide as our screen but take up
as little height as possible so I'll
give it a width of match parent and a
height of wrap content and wrap content
means that the height is only as big as
it needs to be to fit all the content in
the banner ad it wraps around the
content then I can add our ad layout by
saying layout ad view our banner ad and
then the dimensions and finally after
defining the placement of my ad and the
views I still want them to display on my
screen and I do this by saying set
content view and passing in a relative
layout then we need to do one more thing
which is load our ad and this is the
same as with an interstitial ad we just
say our variable banner ad dot load ad
but unlike our interstitial ad a banner
ad will load and show automatically once
it's loaded so we don't need a listener
unless we want a really specific
behavior and now we're done let's see
what this looks like when we run our
game using BlueStacks emulator again and
now you can see we get our Escalus game
now it's a banner ad right at the top of
our screen great job now you know how to
use the Amazon mobile ads API to make
the two most common types of ads banner
ads and interstitial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
