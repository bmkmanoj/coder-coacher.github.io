reinforcing the observed behavior
bandura put children into four groups
Group one saw video with no models Group
two saw two adult males interacting in a
non aggressive way group three and group
four saw two adult males playing with
one of the males being aggressive
however in group three the aggressive
one was punished and in Group four the
aggressive one was rewarded the first
two groups are what we would consider
the control groups in group three in
group four were the experimental groups
the results showed that the kids in the
two experimental groups were more
aggressive than the kids in the control
groups however the kids who saw the
adult being rewarded were even more
aggressive than anyone else
this proves that we not only learn from
other people's behavior we also take
into account the consequences of other
people's behavior and those consequences
would be either punishment or the reward</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
