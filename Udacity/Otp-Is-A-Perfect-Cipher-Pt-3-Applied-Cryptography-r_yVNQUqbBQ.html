over k went over the size of K now we've
shown that the probability of M equals M
star is equal the probability the
message is M star divided Billy by okay
so we've shown these two things now we
just need to plug them into our
conditional probability formula we're
gonna have this on top and we're gonna
divide that by the probability B which
is 1 over K the over caves will cancel
out leaving us with the probability the
message is equal to M star and that's
exactly our definition of a perfect
cipher so we can conclude that the
one-time pad is a perfect cipher it
exactly satisfies the definition of our
perfect cipher where the cipher text
reveals nothing at all about the key so
you might think the class should be over
we've achieved our goal of perfect
secrecy using a cipher that was invented
over a hundred years ago and is actually
provably perfectly secret so we're not
quite done yet there's some pretty
serious problems with the one-time pad
one problem is that it's malleable so
what malleable means is if Alice sends
her ciphertext to Bob and our evil
interceptor this time it's not just an
eavesdropper
it's an eavesdropper with a hammer if
our interceptor has control over the
network and instead of just being an
eavesdropper can be an active attacker
and an active attacker means they can
actually change messages on the network
so the message that arrives at Bob is
not C it's C prime because it's the
perfect cipher the attacker can't learn
anything new about the message from C
but she could modify it and maybe she
had a pretty good guess about maybe
there was a number in the message
somewhere or something that she wanted
to change well she could flip the bits
at that part of the message change the
ciphertext that Bob receives to see it
would decrypt and with the one-time pad
encryption and decryption of the same
function the decryption of C prime would
be M Prime and the attacker can actually
control the difference between M and M
Prime because the way of the one-time
pad were
is just XOR so the attacker could decide
whatever difference she wants to
introduce in the message this is a
dangerous property for a cipher to have
another big problem with a one-time pad
is that it's very impractical and the
real reason that it's impractical is
because the keys have to be as long as
the messages and we can never reuse the
key so this is this property that the
number of possible keys is equal to the
number of possible messages so maybe
what we should try to do is to find a
more practical perfect cipher
unfortunately Claude Shannon proved that
that's not possible
so that's what we're going to look at
next is why this property that the key
space has to be at least as big as the
message space is a requirement for a
cipher being perfect</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
