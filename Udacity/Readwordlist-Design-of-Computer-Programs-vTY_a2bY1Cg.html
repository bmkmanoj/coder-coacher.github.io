new concept that we didn't see before in
our initial listing of the concepts but
which is important one the notion of a
prefix of a word is important only for
efficiency not for correctness so that's
why we didn't show up in the first time
and the idea is that given a word there
are substrings which are prefixes of the
word the empty string is such a prefix
just W is a prefix wo is a prefix wor is
a prefix now we always have to decide
what do we want to do at the end points
I think for the way I want to use it i
do want to include the empty string as a
valid prefix but I think I don't want to
include the entire string wor d I'm not
going to count that as a prefix of the
word that is the word so I'm going to
define this function prefixes of word
it's pretty straightforward just iterate
through the range and the prefixes of
wor d are the empty string and these
three longer strings so now here's the
first bit that I want you to do for me
now reading in our list of words from
the dictionary is a little bit
complicated and that we want to compute
two things a set of words and a set of
prefixes for all the words in the
dictionary the set together of prefixes
for each word Union all those together
I'm going to put that together into a
function read word list which takes a
file name and returns these two sets so
I want you to write the code for that
function here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
