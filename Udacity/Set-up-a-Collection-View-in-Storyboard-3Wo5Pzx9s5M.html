up a collection view in storyboard there
are two ways to set up table view
controllers and collection view
controllers in storyboard the first way
you've seen before you start with a
regular UI view controller like this one
and then you drag in a table view or a
collection view the second option is to
use a table view controller like this
one or a collection view controller like
this one in the table views lesson we
used option 1 now we'll set up our
collection view controller using option
2 here I've opened the Bond villains and
tabs project but this version doesn't
have a collection view controller setup
yet to access this project switch to the
git branch in the instructors notes now
open up the Bond villains and tabs
project so that you can follow along
with me as I go through the steps to add
a collection view controller to your
project the first step is to drag in a
navigation controller next you'll want
to delete the root view controller that
automatically came with that navigation
controller next you'll want to drag in a
collection view controller and this item
is of the class UI collection view
controller next up control click on that
navigation controller and set its root
view controller to be the collection
view controller you just added remember
that we want our collection view to show
up in our tab bar to accomplish that
first control click on the tab bar
controller and we want to add this
second navigation controller to our view
controllers array so we can drag here
from the view controllers array and add
that second navigation controller next
we need to set the name of the
collection view controller to match the
name of the class where all our
collection view methods are implemented
to do that we click on the collection
view controller and then open up the
identity inspector on the right here
under class we're going to put villain
collection view controller of course
when you're setting this up for Mimi
you're gonna put sent memes collection
view controller next we're going to
configure our collection view cell in
order to do that let's open up the
outline view on the left here in the
outline under villain collection view
controller we can see the
in view cell go ahead and click on it we
need to set the name of the cells class
to match the custom cell class that we
implemented earlier so up here under
class and the identity inspector we're
going to put villain collectionview cell
and when you're setting up Mimi you'll
type in whatever name you used for your
custom cell class now I'm just gonna
make this collectionview cell a little
bit bigger and then I'm gonna drag in an
image view right now I'm just dragging
in an image view for testing purposes I
just want to be able to see the cells so
that I know I set them up correctly now
I need to connect an outlet to this UI
image view so you can see here that I've
opened up the assistant editor and we've
got our villain collection view sell
about Swift file here on the right now
to connect the outlet all I do is drag
from this circle to the UI image view in
storyboard last but not least we need to
make sure we set the reuse identifier
for our collection view cell so you'll
want to make sure you click on the
collection view cell and then you'll go
over here to the attributes inspector
and under identifier put villain
collection view cell all right let's run
it and see what we've got all right
there's our collection view and it seems
to be loading data fine and in the next
session I'm going to talk about how to
use the class UI collection view flow
layout so that you can arrange these
cells the way you want them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
