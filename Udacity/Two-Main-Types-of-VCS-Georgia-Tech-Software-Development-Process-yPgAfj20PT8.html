there are many different version control
systems but we can classify them
normally in two main types centralized
vcs's and decentralized vcs's so what is
the difference between these two let's
use again our friends Janet and Brad in
the case of a centralized version
control system there is a single
centralized as the name says repository
on which they are committing their files
so when Janet commits a file the file
will go from her local working directory
to the repository and the same will
happen to Brett the decentralized system
is a little more interesting
because in this case they will both have
sort of a local repository in which they
can commit their changes so they can
commit changes without the other users
of the VCS being able to see these
changes and when they're happy with the
version and when they are ready to
release the version they can push it to
a central repository and at that point
it will become available to the other
users of the repository to the other
users of the VCS there are several
advantages in a distributed system I'm
just going to mention a few because that
there are really many one is the fact of
having this local version if you use VCS
before I'm sure you've been in the
situation in which you want to kind of
take a snapshot of what you have but you
don't want a snapshot to be available to
the other users because it's still not
ready to be released to be looked at if
you're using a centralized system
there's really no way you can do that
unless you make a local copy which is
something we said you don't want to do
with the distributor with the
decentralized VCS you can commit your
local changes here in your local
repository and you can push them to the
central repository only when you're
ready another big advantage is that you
can use multiple remote repository and
in fact centralize is not the right name
for this one this is just a remote
repository and I can have more than one
for example bread may want to push to
another remote repository as well for
instance this could be a repository
where the files are accessible for wider
distribution imagine developing a
software system in which a team is
sharing internal versions and then only
some of these versions are actually
pushed to the report so that is seeable
to the whole world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
