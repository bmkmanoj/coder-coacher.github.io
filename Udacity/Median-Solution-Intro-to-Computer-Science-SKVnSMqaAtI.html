at the possibilities we know that
there's a bigger number the median and a
smaller number and that we have three
inputs let's call them a B and C let's
say for the sake of example that we
figure out B is the bigger number we
could solve this using the bigger
function that you defined in lecture
from here we only need to figure out
what is the median and the smaller
number we know B can't be the median
because we decided that it was the
bigger number from here all we have to
do is compare a and C there are two
cases at this point one is where a is
greater than C if a is greater than C we
know C is the smaller number and a is
the median if C is greater than a we
know that a is a smaller number and C is
the median we can use this strategy to
solve every possible case when defining
our function so let's take a crack at it
by going right to the interpreter so
first let's define our function that's
specified in the problem
it's called median and we take in three
parameters as I did before we're going
to call them a B and C as I described
earlier we want to find the biggest
number first let's call it big here's
the perfect time to use the function
that we defined in class biggest biggest
will give us the biggest number as the
name describes by simply passing in the
three parameters from here we enumerate
the possible cases as I described
earlier if a is the biggest number we
want to return the bigger number of B
and C if B is the biggest number we want
to return the bigger number of a and C
and lastly if C is the biggest number
which is satisfied by the else here we
want to turn the bigger number of a and
B</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
