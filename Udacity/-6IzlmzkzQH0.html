differences between strings and lists
the first we've seen already is that a
list can hold anything we want whereas a
string the elements could only be
characters the second big difference
between lists and strings is that lists
support mutation mutation sounds a
little bit scary and in some ways it is
scary it makes it much harder to
understand what our programs mean but
it's also very powerful
what mutation means is we can change the
value of a list after we've created it
so to explain what that means and to see
why it's so different from the behavior
we can get with strings let's recap what
happens with strings so we can create a
string we can store it in a variable we
can change the value of the variable by
creating a new string so what's going on
there is changing the value of s but
it's not changing the value of the
string when we did the first statement
this one it created a string with the
value hello and it introduced a variable
S which referred to that string when we
execute the second statement that
creates a new string with the value
yellow and it changes s to refer to that
new string it hasn't changed the string
that we created with the value hello we
just don't have a way to refer to that
anymore
with strings we can also use the plus
operator to concatenate two strings it
looks like this is changing the value of
the string you might think that the
result of this is well now the string
that was previously Yello spelled wrong
is now yellow spelled with the W added
to end but that's not actually what
happens we don't actually modify the
string we had what happens when we use
the plus operator it creates a
completely new string where the value of
the new string is the result of
concatenating the two input strings so
when we execute the third statement
first a new string with the value W is
created then when we do the
concatenation it doesn't modify the
previous string that we created it
creates a whole new string which will
have the value yellow spelled with the W
and then the assignment changes what s
refers to to refer to the new string
so now let's see what we can do with
lists</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
