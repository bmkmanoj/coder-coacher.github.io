are different types of tools that you
can use in your toolbox
we just saw the count calls I think I
would classify that as a debugging tool
and we saw a memo and I'll classify that
as a performance tool and earlier we saw
an Arri another decorator which I can
classify as an expressiveness tool gives
you more power to say more about your
language this takes gives you know more
power but makes it faster this isn't
going to end up in your final program
but helps you develop the program faster
and I want to add another tool here in
debugging called trace which can help
you see the execution of your program so
I'm going to define a decorator trace
which when we apply to fib gives us this
kind of output when I ask here for
what's the sixth Fibonacci number it
says for each recursive call we have an
indented call with an arrow going to the
right thing we're making a call and for
each return we have an arrow going to
the left when you ask for fib of 6 we
keep on going down the list until we get
near the end when we ask for fib of 2
then that's defined in terms of 1 and 0
and they both return 1 so that means fib
2 returns 2 and so on and we can see
sort of the shape of the trace here as
we go it's coming to the right and then
returning back and coming to the right
some more and returning back the pattern
takes a long time to reveal itself and
would take even longer for larger
arguments other than 6 but it gives you
some idea for the flow of control of the
program so that's a useful tool to have
and here's an implementation follows the
same pattern as usual decorator takes a
function as input we're going to create
another function and this is what it's
going to look like we're going to figure
out what it is that we're going to rent
we're going to keep a variable which we
keep as an attribute of the trace
function itself called the level and
we'll increment that as we come in print
out some results here we initialize the
trace level to 0 the indentation level
and then finally we return the function
that we just built up i've left out some
bits here and I want you to fill them in
make this function work properly to show
the trace that I just showed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
