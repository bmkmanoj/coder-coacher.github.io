let's look at an example let's consider
a specific use case maintain curriculum
in which we have the Registrar that
interacts with the system to do
operations for maintaining the
curriculum and let's define the flow of
events for this use case to do this
we're going to go back as usual to the
description of our system so this is the
one that you already saw several times
but I would like for you to do something
I would like for you to stop the video
look back at the spec the one that is
shown here and write on your own what
you think is the informal flow of events
that characterizes the interaction of
the registration manager with the system
and it is very important that you keep
in mind something as you're doing that
you should keep in mind that as it
always happens when extracting
requirements from an initial
specification and particularly an
informal one like this one a high-level
one you will have to be able to read
between the lines and fill in the blanks
that is you have to provide information
for the missing parts using your domain
knowledge so try to do that exercise
read the description and see how you
will define the steps the flow of events
for the maintain curriculum use case if
you're done with that now let's see the
possible informal paragraph that
describes that flow of events and the
one I'm providing now it is just one
possibility based on my experience and
based on the way I see this possible for
events so yours might look different of
course in my case because the
description was mentioned in the fact
that every user is got a login and a
password I decided that the first step
should be that the Registrar logs onto
the system and enters his or her
password as it normally happens with
password-protected systems if the
passport is valid the register will get
into the system and the system at this
point that you asked to specify a
semester for which the maintained
curriculum activity has to be performed
the Registrar will therefore enter the
desired semester the interface that I
envisioned is one in which the system
will prompt the register to select the
desired activity add delete review or
quit and if the register selects add the
system will allow the register to add a
course to the course list for the
selected semester similarly if the
Registrar selects delete the system will
let the register the leader course from
the course list for the select the
semester and again similarly if the
register selects review the system will
simply display the course information in
the course list for the selected
semester and finally
if the register selects quit the system
will simply exit and our use case will
end so again there's the main knowledge
that goes into this but this is a good
example of how you can refine the
initial description to identify these
scenarios that then you will use to
specify and implement your system and as
we discussed a few minutes ago we
provided the information that was
requested for for a use case how the use
case starts by logging into the system
and how it ends by selecting quit we
describe the normal flow events and of
course this flow of events could be
improved them because right now even
though we describe how the use case
starts and ends we just describe one
possible flow of events but there's many
alternative ways we could provide and we
do not describe any exceptional flow of
events so this could be the starting
point for multiple use cases or for a
use cases just richer and contains more
information more steps so a richer flow
but you should have gotten the idea of
what a use case should be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
