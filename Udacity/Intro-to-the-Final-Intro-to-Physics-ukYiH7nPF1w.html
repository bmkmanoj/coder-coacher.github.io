through the course you have learned so
much you've learned how to calculate the
circumference of the earth how to
quantify motion how to use Newton's laws
to calculate acceleration how to keep
the Netherlands dry how to find your
location at see how to protect tall
buildings from lightning and even a bit
of special relativity now it's time to
use what you learned and put in practice
on the final exam this exam will have no
deadline and you can take it whenever
you want you'll get instant feedback on
each question so you can submit as many
answers as you'd like without penalty

answers you get correct the criteria for
each of these certificates is below the
video good luck on the exam teaching
this course has been an incredible
experience I've been really blown away
by the amount of curiosity and
helpfulness that I've seen the forums
I'd like to say thank you to Jonathan
for everything he's done to make this
class possible to grant the editor and
videographer without him this wouldn't
have happened and of course to you for
everything you've done to make this
class such a success I can't wait to see
you in future Udacity classes good luck
