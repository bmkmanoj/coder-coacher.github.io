example I want to show you just a couple
more things that help make your
regression as useful as it can be the
first thing is you might want to be able
to make a prediction with it and of
course this is something that shouldn't
be that difficult for that you can just
call the predict function on your
regression but here's one little catch
it's going to be expecting a list of
values so even if you only have one
value that you want to be predicting you
still need to put it in a list you might
also be wondering what the coefficients
and the intercept of the regression are
and you can access these using Renko F
and reg intercept like you can see here
don't forget this little underscore here
otherwise it won't know what you're
talking about
so remember that the slope we expected
to be pretty close to six point two five
but maybe not exact and the intercept
should be close to zero but again we
wouldn't expect it to be exactly right
because there's a little bit of noise in
our in our training data there are a few
more lines here about the r-squared
score let me come back to that in just a
second but I want to show you what the
prediction the coefficients in the
intercept are right away so these three
lines are the ones we were just talking
about I can predict my net worth based
on the regression it's about 160 based
on my age I can also print out the slope
and the intercept remember we thought
the slope would be about six point two
five it's close but not exact similarly
for the intercept it's not quite zero in
the next few videos we're going to talk
a lot about the types of errors that you
can get on regressions because they're
fundamentally different from the types
of errors that you get in classification
and where we're eventually going is
we're going to be computing something
called the r-squared
now the next few lines give you some
output about the performance of your
regression so one way you can evaluate a
regression that we'll be talking about
much more in the videos to come is a
metric called the r-squared there's also
the sum of the errors we'll be talking
about all of these but let me show you
just what it looks like now so you have
some reason to understand why it's
important the way that you access these
performance metrics is using something
called the score function performed on
your regression and you always want to
be looking at the score on your testing
data because of course you're fitting
your regression using your training data
so if there's any overfitting going on
that'll show up in having a lower score
when you look at your testing data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
