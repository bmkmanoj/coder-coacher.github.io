the location and now we want to remove
all passengers who wanted to get to that
location that turns out to be a bit
tricky so I want to find the passenger
and then remove it to remove a passenger
I need to know the index so I have an
index I starts at zero up to but not
including the passenger sighs I get the
I passenger I test whether the
destination of that person equals the
current location and then I remove it
that's all fine but there's something
that one needs to be very careful about
and that is when you remove the
passenger you can't increment the index
here's what I mean here are my
passengers and let's say I is 1 and now
Jane has reached your destination she
gets removed then of course Mary now
ends up in place one and then I need to
come back to the loop with I staying at
one so that I can examine whether Mary
should also leave the car so that's why
the two branches here in this branch I
remove the passenger and in the other
branch I increment I to get to see the
next one now the car and the person
class have most of the functionality
that I need but some way I still need to
put the entire simulation together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
