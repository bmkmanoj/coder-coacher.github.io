assertion can no longer fail this is how
the argument goes in order for the
assertion to fail the out variable must
contain a less than son since this is
the only place where characters are
being added tag cannot be said the code
variable however must be said because
otherwise we would have gone in that
first branch over here but then quote
can only be set in this very location
but this can't be the case because from
step 2 we already know that tag cannot
be set and therefore we have a
contradiction between these two which
means that the assertion will never fail
quod erat demonstrandum winning what was
shown to be proved this was a nice proof
wasn't it I must confess that I don't
entirely trust my own proof it's very
much like in the quote of Don Knuth once
said we wear of bugs in the above code I
have only proven it correct not tried it
so in order to check whether my code now
would be really correct with respect to
this assertion I went and use an
automated deduction tool the doula was
using his name pex this is an
experimental tool for microsoft research
which is a very very thorough tester
which gets possible inputs from the
program code so backs does the same
deduction steps as Sherlock Holmes would
do or as I would do or as you would do
in order to come up with inputs that
cause a built-in assertion to fail and
my idea was if Tex doesn't find anything
then chances are my program is really
correct let's go and see packs in action
the pex tool has its own web page where
you can try it out it's called wwp x4
funcom here you can enter code which you
want to be tested automatically by packs
and since packs works for the language
is C sharp visual basic and f sharp I
converted our remove HTML markup
function into C sharp you see the
function I've renamed it to puzzle in
order to match the x4 fan conventions
here's the precondition the string
that's passed must not be null which is
a special c-sharp thing and
here we have the loop over all the
individual elements setting tag and
setting quote or adding the character to
the result at the end we have an
assertion the result must not contain a
less than character let's first try this
out on the buggy version and let's see
whether packs can find the bug we click
on ask pecs and now you see a number of
interesting inputs these would all be
inputs which cover various parts of the
code at the very end what you see here
is an error message the assertion has
failed and the assertion fails precisely
on our buggy input double quote followed
by a less than sign so pecs has been
able by going through the code to come
up with the exact same failing input as
an hour deduction example now I have
gone and fixed the program the question
is whether pecs can now find an input
that makes the assertion fail and again
we ask pecs and again it comes up with a
number of interesting inputs all of
these interesting inputs cause the
program to run properly that is despite
its best efforts and pecs is really good
in detecting errors pecs has not found a
single input which causes the assertion
to fail so for the fixed program even
Peck says this is correct and I myself
also have said this is correct if you
don't believe an automatic deduction
tool you can believe me and if you don't
believe me you can believe in automatic
deduction tools together we create a big
deal of confidence in this program</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
