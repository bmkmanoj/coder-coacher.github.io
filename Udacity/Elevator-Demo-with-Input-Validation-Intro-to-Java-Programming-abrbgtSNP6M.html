you've learned in this lesson to solve
an important problem how to validate the
input that a human user provided think
again about the program with which we
started this lesson the elevator
simulator the user enters a number
between 1 and 18 but not 13 there's no
button labeled 13 and then that program
computed the actual floor
never mind that part what I want to talk
about is the part where we read the user
input in a program we don't have buttons
but we ask the user to type in the input
there's a prompt and then what if some
crazy user now enters 19 in the hope of
getting to the roof or something or - -
or some text users do all sorts of
interesting things and when they do the
program might misbehave so it's a better
idea to catch those first and just tell
the user that that was not right let's
list the things that can go wrong and
how one can address them in Java first
off there's no button 13 and so in Java
you might write if the floor equals 13
then print an error for the user let's
continue the next rule is that the
bottom floor is 1 and the top floor is
18 so if the user enters a number that
is less than 1 or greater than 18 we
want to reject that here is the Java
code note the use of the or operator
here if the floor is less than 1 or
greater than 18 then we print this error
message and finally there is the issue
what if the user doesn't even type any
number but some words that would
actually be bad because then the next
int method would fail let me show you
how to protect against that there is
another method that we haven't yet seen
called house next int which looks at the
user input and instead of doing what the
next int method does namely returning it
it does checks whether it is an integer
or not it returns true if the user
entered an integer it returns false if
the user entered something else in other
words it's a method that returns a
boolean value so we can test for that in
the if statement if the method returns
true then it is safe to call next int we
can read the input and then process it
in any way we want if on the other hand
this method returns 4
then we print an error message now it's
your turn put those three pieces
together and fix up the elevator demo so
that any bad input from the user is
caught and the program only proceeds
when the user did the right thing an
integer between 1 and 18 but not 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
