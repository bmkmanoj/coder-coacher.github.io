consider this time we have f of x equals
x times X minus 2 times X minus 2 times
X minus 1 times X minus 1 well this is
interesting we have some repeated
factors here so far we've only seen
polynomial functions that have unique
zeros or all factors with different
zeros associated with them in the past
when we were looking at these functions
with unique zeros the number of zeros
was always equal to the degree of the
polynomial I wonder if that's the case
if we have some zeros that are repeated
instead let's use this function to check
that out what I'd like you to do to
analyze this function then is to enter
the x value of each of its zeros and
then tell me how many times each of
those factors associated with those
zeros occur in the equation for the
function so if you said that one of the
zeros was four for example and you saw
the factor X minus four three times in
this equation you would write a three
right here lastly I'd like you to add up
the total number of zeros that we have
this total number should just be the sum
of all the numbers in these repeat boxes
think that about how this should relate
to the total number of factors we see in
this equation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
