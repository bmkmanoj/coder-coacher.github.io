setting it up we need to figure out the
correct placement of the values on the
left hand side of the butterfly network
even though as we go forward here Omega
is going to be negative I instead of I
because we're doing the inverse
transform we need to order the values
according to the Omega that was used in
the forward transform so thus Omega to
the 1 is I and Omega to the third power
is negative I here carrying the
calculation forward a level we obtain
these results here then for this last
level we have 4 plus 8 which is 12
good then for this next one we want
Omega to the first power times this and
because we're doing the inverse
transform that Omega is negative I and
that gives us this result here of 4 for
the next one we multiply the odd term by
negative 1 so that gives us negative 4
here and for the last one we multiply by
our Omega cubed which is I we multiply
that by the odd term and combining that
with this gives us a total of 8 to get
the original polynomial we divide by n
for in this case thus we have that the
original polynomial was 3 plus X minus x
squared plus 2x cubed and you can check
that that all works out note that there
is a sense in which the ordering over
here was arbitrary we could have done
the forward transform with Omega equal
to negative I in which case I would have
flipped these and then the inverse
transform would have used I here and
negative I here and that would have
given us the same result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
