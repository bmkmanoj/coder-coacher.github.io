little bit here what I find interesting
is that there's the game industry where
we we see that a lot because there's a
lot of games out there and there's sort
of computer-aided design which is sort
of a different kind of a graphics
different kind of a 3d computer graphics
way of doing things so well for start is
what what's what would you say is the
biggest difference between sort of games
programming and computer aided design
programming I think the end result is a
big difference in that if you're playing
a game and something happened with the
visuals and a frame or two goes off the
worst that happens as your avatar dies
if you mess up in your computer aided
design package people can daddy it's
it's just that there's there's much more
I think I've much more invested in in
AutoCAD because of the importance of the
work that it does well with game design
it's kind of a limited field no sense
and that there in total control of the
product and there's a whole team working
on that your product is different in the
sense that you're selling to people and
they're using it for who knows what can
you tell us some of the differences
there well like that in games the the
world and the behavior is fairly static
that the things happen and things I move
around then change but in general like
you said there's a lot of control that
the the game designers the game
programmers have over what's going on in
the game whereas with the CAD system our
users can do pretty much anything and an
interesting thing is that CAD systems
are you can view it as a way of creating
content so people that actually write
games using a CAD system to design the
assets for the game and then play the
game so they can they can almost
interact with each other that way but
you need a lot more flexibility within
your the CAD package or what whatever
pocket are using to design the assets
for the game once you get it in the game
there a lot of tricks the programmers
play and artists in order to fake things
out and sort of get we need done again
you can also deal with the fact that if
you're a little bit off one frame it
won't have what really matter because
the action is moving quickly enough that
you'll get right past it right i mean
just the fact that there's a reality to
you know whatever your whatever you're
building makes sense that there's you
know autocad and so on really has sort
of different kinds of
straints well with that for example I
mean other constraints as far as a
precision or elements like that
definitely we have to deal with things
like we have this one model that we use
internally for a lot of testing which is
a model of the solar system so we have
to have autocad be able to go all the
way from the looking at the entire solar
system down to looking in a plaque on
the moon that was left by neil armstrong
and we need to be able to read the
lettering on that plaque so there's the
range of precision that we have to deal
with it can really blow away a lot of
the graphics hardware so again there's
some tricks you have to play in order to
be able to handle the all that different
resolution with only single precision
floating point the nice thing is that
we're dealing with soft but we had our
software implementation corfu a double
precision we could deal with it much
better but we when your end result
really requires single precision that's
where it gets tricky</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
