want to go back to languages the first
thing I want to say is that our culture
is full of stories of wishful thinking
we have a story of Pinocchio who wishes
to be a real boy and the story of
Dorothy who wishes to return from Oz to
her home in Kansas by clicking her shoes
together and they find that they have
the power within them to fulfill their
wishes and programming is often like
that I'm writing the body of the
definition of a function and i wish i
had the function fib defined already and
if I just assume that I did then
eventually my wish will come true so in
this case it was good while writing the
right-hand side to just assume i wish i
had the function i want and proceed as
if you did and sometimes it's a good
idea to say i wish i had the language i
want and proceed as if you did now
here's an example suppose you had to
deal with algebraic expressions and not
just compute them the way we can type
this expression into Python and see its
value of x is defined but manipulate
them have the user typed them in modify
them and treat them as objects rather
than as something to be evaluated now my
question for you is is it possible to
write a regular expression which could
recognize expressions like this that are
valid it's the answer yes it is possible
to write that no it's not possible
because our language we're trying to do
define has the plus asterisk symbols and
those are special within regular
expressions or no we can't parse this
language because this language includes
parentheses and we can't do balanced
parentheses with regular expressions if
you're not familiar with language theory
this may be a hard question for you but
go ahead and give it a shot anyways</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
