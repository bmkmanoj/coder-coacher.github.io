so I said here there are three possible
next States we can put a on the table a
on D or D on a the problem is that none
of those states reduce the difference to
the goal and in fact all three of those
states move us further away from the
goal if we put D on a then we no longer
have D on the table if we put a on the
table or a on D then we no longer have a
on B so with means-ends analysis it
doesn't look like there's any way to get
any closer to our goal than we currently
are that's right David and that means
that means and son alice's does not
always take us towards equal sometimes
it can take us away from the goal and
sometimes means-ends analysis can get
caught in loops means-ends analysis like
generate and test is an example of
universal AI methods these universal air
methods are applicable to very large
classes of problems however they come
with few guarantees of success and they
are often very costly they're costly in
terms of computational efficiency they
neither provide any guarantees of
computational efficiency not provide any
guarantees of the optimality of the
solution at a come up with they are
power lies in the fact that they can be
applied to a very large class of
problems later in this class will
discuss problem solving methods which
are very specialized problem solving
methods those methods are applicable to
a smaller class of problems however they
are more tuned to those problems and
often are more efficient and sometimes
also provide guarantees over the
optimality or dissolution although means
in San alisis did not work very for this
problem that in fact works quite well
for many other problems and therefore is
an important AI method later in this
class when we come to planning we will
look at more powerful specialized
methods that can infect address this
class of problems quite well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
