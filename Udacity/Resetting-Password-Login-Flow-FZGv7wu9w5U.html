by mistake or on purpose
are signing up with email addresses that
don't exist or are not theirs
this issue is made worse by the fact
that we've associated Google login
emails with the email password logins
that the user enters this is starting to
look like a major security issue
here let me show you all right so here's
Walter and here we have an evil hacker
let's say that Walter logs in with
Google and that his Google account is
associated with his gmail account which
has the address American guy w15 21 at
gmail.com when this account was created
it also creates a user in our database
so he logs in and he's all happy and he
makes some shopping lists okay so the
hacker figures out Walters gmail address
because maybe Walter isn't too shy about
sharing it he puts it up on a social
networking site or something like that
and then what the hacker does is he
makes a account through email and
password that uses the same email
address and with how we've set things up
he gets to choose whatever password he'd
like and it's fine for him to use this
email because the real Walter never made
a user and firebase with email and
password just with Google with the code
as it is now these two accounts here are
associated and they're considered to be
the same user so the hacker has now
essentially gotten into Walters account
because the same email address was used
for both and all those new permissions
that we added such as only the owner can
change the name of a list or only the
owner could delete a list are
meaningless because well the hackers
gotten into Walters account so he could
rename Walter's lists as much as he
likes and poor Walter is powerless to do
anything about it as we start writing
more code related to ownership in the
app Walter's gonna get the ability to
make lists of their private to himself
but with this security flaw a hacker
would be able to see all of Walter's
private items and lists now you might be
saying let's undissociated mail
addresses but this would still leave an
issue that the hacker could enter this
account and sort of masquerade as Walter
it would also mean that Walter could not
use his own email address if he ever
decided to make a email password
provider user so I think a better way to
go about this is to try to go away that
we can have the user prove that they
actually owned the email address that
they put in to do this you can employ a
creative use of firebases password reset
functionality Here I am in the login and
auth tab and if you scroll down you'll
see this section that's all about
password resets in your code you can
trigger for a user to receive a password
reset email
and here's where you can configure what
that email will look like you can
configure things like what the subject
of the email will be or who it's from
and if you scroll down a little bit more
here's the actual body of the email now
this includes a token string and this
token string is basically the reset
password that is generated for your user
so with all of this in mind here's the
new flow that I'm thinking of first when
the user signs up they'll no longer be
asked for a password instead the screen
will just take their email and their
name this is the information that will
be used in the call to create user will
generate a sort of dummy password that
we're gonna throw away pretty quickly
because if creating that user is
successful will immediately reset the
password using the reset password method
immediately after resetting the password
an intent will open the users default
email app now reset password is the
method that triggers that email to be
sent to the user and it uses the email
address that they entered here so as
long as they're connected to the
internet they should see that the first
email in their email inbox is the
password reset email and they can go
ahead and open that email and get a
randomly generated password they can
then copy the password that's in their
email and navigate back to the app when
they return to the app instead of seeing
the create account activity screen
instead they'll see the login activity
screen and we can even be nice and pre
populate the email up here with whatever
email they originally gave us then if we
instructed them to copy the password
here they can paste it here and sign in
and for now the first time that the user
sends in we can actually use firebases
change password method to then change
the random password that was originally
generated for the user to the reset
password that they just put in and in
this way we can confirm that the user at
least has access to the email account
that they put in here okay now this is
by no means perfect for one it makes the
reset password the user is permanent
password and the reset password is
fairly hard to remember it's just some
sort of random string of numbers of
digits also when you call the reset
password method whatever password is
generated only works for 24 hours so
there is a scenario where a user could
create a new user get the reset email
and then get busy and decide not to sign
in and then try to sign in after 24
hours and lose access to their account
but for beta version 0.3 I think this is
a pretty good flow and it does remove
the most glaring security flaws of a
current login process okay so let me
quickly show you these two methods that
are new to you the reset code is pretty
straightforward just like
everything else that we've been doing
with authentication you should grab a
firebase ruff you can then called reset
password on that firebase ref and all it
really needs is a email address that's
in the system which means an email
address that you've called create user
with if this reset password call is
successful it will send an email and
take you here and if it's not successful
you'll get the error down here this
might happen for example if you put in
an email address here that doesn't exist
in the system you'd get the user does
not exist error that we've talked about
before when the user signs in for the
first time
you should go up and change password
method this will take that same email
address of the user as well as the old
password and the new password you can
use the reset password for both of these
now you should only change the password
if this is the first time that the users
log again I'll leave it up to you to
decide how to check whether the user has
logged in before or hasn't logged in it
before and if you forgot why calling
change password it's important it's
because the users reset password that
they received in their email is only
valid for 24 hours
now if shopping list plus plus was going
into production immediately what I'd
have you do is create some extra screens
so that the user could change their
password from the reset password to
something that they can memorize a
little bit easier but again we'll start
with this okay the full spec is on the
way so good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
