steps in it sold both of these problems
really neatly what I've got here is an
example of how quicksort would sort a
series of numbers at the top level a
single kernel partitions the numbers
into two groups then launches two
quicksort kernels one on each group and
so on down it would already have all the
information it needs to decide whether
to launch and how many threads to use
because it's just done the partitioning
so it doesn't have to communicate this
back to the CPU that's the first problem
taken care of it solves the second
problem because as these kernels run
they each launch as soon as they finish
partitioning that means my progress is
asynchronously for example this one on
the left will launch its children while
the one on the right is still working
because there's more work to do on the
right hand side here each sort will be
running independently of any others I'm
not waiting around for the slowest sort
anymore and my GPU is kept busy so
here's what the code looks like I'm not
gonna get to detail about the
partitioning function because we're
looking at dynamic launches here and you
already cover the partitioning in a
previous lecture the important things to
notice is there's no host side
management of data or launch was needed
everything happens inside the code
itself
here are my launches inside my kernel of
my next quicksort kernels so my codes
nice and simple and the kernel launches
it's two children in two separate
streams
remember that CUDA streams run
simultaneously which means my two sub
sorts will execute in parallel without
these streams everything would run
sequentially because both of these
launches would end up in the null stream
and that would defeat the purpose of the
parallel sort to have my program running
sequentially so let's have a quick look
back at the sort diagram to show you
what I mean if each launch runs
sequentially then I would do the left
side first then its children left side
first here then the right-hand side then
I would come back and do the right-hand
side next and then so on and so what we
would see is that each step gets run
sequentially instead of in parallel
which defeats the purpose of the
parallel sort so by launching the sort
in two different streams we run both the
left and right sorts in parallel
so I would run both of these together
and then each of their children and so
on and I'd get the parallel performance
I'm looking for I've combined dynamic
parallelism with CUDA streams to get the
parallel execution that I just would not
be able to do any other way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
