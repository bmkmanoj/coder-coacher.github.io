is sometimes confusing for students and
that is the topic of statistical
significance statistical significance in
the area of statistics has a very
specialized meaning and it's kind of
counterintuitive it doesn't really fit
with what we normally think of in terms
of significance so in everyday life we
use the word significant to talk about
things that are important to us things
that are large or sizable things that
are meaningful in statistics the phrase
statistical significance has none of
these meanings I'm going to write on the
other side what significance does mean
significance does mean that we've
rejected the null hypothesis
significance also means that our results
are not likely due to chance or sampling
error notice that this and this are just
two different ways of saying the same
thing the important point is to note
when you see the word statistical
significance it doesn't mean that our
results are important that they are
large or sizable or that they were even
meaningful all it means is that the
results are probably not due to chance
in other words we've ruled out random
chance at or sampling error as an
explanation of our results that's an
important point to keep in mind so how
do we know if the results of a research
study were meaningful or important one
thing we have to know is what was
measured what were the variables did the
variables have practical or social
importance or even theoretical
importance obviously if our variables do
not have any importance in terms of
practical application social issues or
theory then clearly it doesn't matter
what the results were the results are
not important another thing to consider
in assessing the meaningfulness of
results is the effect size how large
were the results that doesn't mean that
small results are not important or large
results are necessarily important but
effect size is considered when assessing
the meaningfulness of results and it's
possible for even very small effect
sizes to be very important a final thing
to consider is can we rule out random
chance for the results in other words
can we rule out sampling error as an
explanation now this doesn't guarantee
that our results are important but it
goes a long way to helping us assess the
rest of the importance next we need to
know can we rule out alternative
explanations for the results
these are those dreaded lurking
variables we've been talking about
before so putting this all together
this gives you a rough guideline of
assessing whether the results of a study
are meaningful what was measured how
large was the effect could we rule out
random chance as an explanation and can
we rule out lurking variables as
explanations for the results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
