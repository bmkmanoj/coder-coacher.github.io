an open-source Python controller Ryu
supports OpenFlow 1.0 1.2 and 1.3 as
well as the nasarah extensions it also
works with OpenStack the support for the
later versions of open flow and the
integration with OpenStack are
advantages over other Sdn controllers
because Ryu is implemented in Python it
still does not perform as well as other
Sdn controllers such as NOx another
popular Sdn controller is floodlight
floodlight is written in Java it
supports open flow 1.0 and is a fork
from the early beacon controller
floodlight is maintained by big switch
networks advantages include good
documentation integration with the REST
API and good performance unfortunately
it also has a fairly steep learning
curve so you should use floodlight if
you already know Java if you need
production level performance and support
and you will use the REST API to
interact with the controller so we can
compare these two controllers with the
two controllers that we already
discussed NOx and pucks
we have controllers in three different
languages Python Java and C++ we have
controllers that support later versions
of OpenFlow and support OpenStack and we
have controllers that provide better
performance as well as controllers that
are easier to use for rapid prototyping
all of these controllers are still
relatively hard to use because they
entail interacting directly with open
flow flow table modifications which
operated a very low level of matching on
flows and performing specific actions as
we'll see it's possible to develop
programming languages on top of these
controllers that make it much easier for
a network operator to reason about
network behavior Before we jump into
higher level programming languages
however let's first see how we can use
these existing control frameworks to
customize Network control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
