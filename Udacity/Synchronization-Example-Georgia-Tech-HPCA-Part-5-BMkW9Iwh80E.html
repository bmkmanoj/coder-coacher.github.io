may need synchronization so let's say we
have two threads and what they're doing
is counting occurrences of different
letters in a letter the first thread
let's call it thread a is counting in
the first half of the document so it's
gonna count occurrences of each letter
in the first half of the document and
the second thread let's call that thread
B is counting in the second half of the
document and then they will put these
counts together somehow
so the code might look like this a
thread will load a letter load from
memory the count for that letter add 1
to that count and then store the new
count back into memory while thread a is
doing this thread B might be doing this
it loads a letter from its own part of
the array note that r1 and r2 are
different in these threads this is kind
of the pointer to where I got in this
part of the array this is the pointer
with this thread got in it's part of the
array so this thread is doing exactly
the same work is this one and as long as
the letters they're processing are
different this is gonna work this thread
is incrementing one part of the count
array this one is incrementing something
else in the counter a but what if this
thread sees letter A and this thread at
the same time sees another letter a in
its own part of the array then what
happens is they both try to load the
same element from the count array let's
say the count was 15 so this one will
load 15 and this one will load 15 now we
add 1 and we get 16 and we do the same
here finally we store 16 to memory and
here we also store 16 to memory so now
there were 2 occurrences of letter A but
the value in the array ends up being 16
which is only 1 more than the original
15 so after both of these threads are
done updating the counter the counter
should have been 17 so clearly this is
incorrect behavior what we need is
really that this happens and then this
happens or the other way around but
these should not be happening
simultaneously because then we can get
the incorrect reason
if for example this happens first we
load we get 15 increments store 16 now
when we load this here cache coherence
ensures that we load 16 and we end up
with 17 here which is a correct result
similarly if we did this first it would
produce 16 in memory then we would load
that in increment to 17 so no matter
which one of these happens first we
should get the correct result but we
don't get the correct result if they
happen in an interleaved fashion they
should happen one at a time
either this and this or all of this and
then all of this so these things that
have to execute kind of one at a time
are called atomic or critical sections
so we have one critical section here and
another one here they can actually be
the same code just both threads are
currently in the same piece of code but
as you can see if we have a section that
should behave as a critical section
meaning we do this without interference
from any other thread if we just let it
happen it's not gonna be done correctly
so what we need is synchronization we
need additional code that ensures that
only one thread gets to do this at any
given time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
