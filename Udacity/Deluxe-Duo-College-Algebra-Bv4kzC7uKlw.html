from the glasses Expo about how to run
his business and how to make all of his
different products better he's ready to
get his glasses wipers and nozzles onto
the market that means that it's time to
talk about profit again a while ago
grant picked out some prices for his
wipers in his nozzles but he wants to
use the algebra skills we've taught him
to check out if these really are the
best choices he could make so let's
revisit the idea of profit for a moment
if profit which will call p is equal to
the money that grant earns minus the
money that he spends and if we call
money spent M then can you write an
equation for profit involving just
single letter variables assume that the
money that grant errands is only coming
from wipers and that the number of wiper
sets sold is equal to n and the price
per wiper set is equal to C</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
