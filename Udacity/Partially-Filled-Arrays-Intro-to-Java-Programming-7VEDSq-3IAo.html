their length is fixed so let's say that
you need to collect some numbers and you
don't quite know how many you're going
to have to make an array that's large
enough to hold them all but then you may
have fewer numbers in the array then it
can hold we say such an array is
partially filled just like this beaker
over here you wouldn't want it to be
filled up all the way to the rim and in
this situation you need to keep track of
two things you need the overall length
of the array so here I'll assume I'll
never have more than a thousand numbers
I allocate my array to have this length
and then I keep a companion variable
that I call the size that tells me how
many elements I currently have right now
I don't have any whenever I need to
insert a new element I execute this code
here I move the new value into values
and bracket size and then I increment
the size for example to insert the very
first element size is zero values
bracket zero is now initialized and the
size becomes one next time values of one
gets filled and so on now what happens
if I fill up the array with a thousand
values and then want to add the thousand
and first let's have a look at that
situation so here I have my partially
filled beaker I fill in more and more
and eventually when it gets full what
choice to 1/2 I have to get a bigger one
and pour everything into that it's the
same with partially filled arrays so
here's my array it's almost full now
it's completely full I'd like to add
another element so I'll get myself an
array that's twice as long
copy over all the values and now I can
forget about the old array and insert my
next element over here of course one can
program that by hand but as it happens
there's a library function that does the
work for us here it is the copy off
function takes an array and then the
desired length of the large array it
then makes a larger array and copies the
original one in there returns the larger
array and we just capture it here again
so that's what you'd have to do if you
ever faced with a situation where
you want to collect an arbitrary number
of values it's that kind of thing that
makes you appreciate the arraylists
where you never have to worry about
growing an array</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
