opens downward great work if you got it
we know it's a parabola since we have an
x squared term but just a y term we
don't have y squared because we don't
have both x squared + y squared we know
our shape will be a parabola to figure
out which direction the parabola opens
we need to solve for y so first i'll
subtract 27 from both sides of the
equation we subtract 27 here and here to
get this new equation now we want to
divide every term by negative 4 to get y
by itself so dividing this by negative 4
we get y dividing this by negative 4 we
get positive 27 / 4 and dividing this by
negative 4 we get negative three-fourths
x squared so since this is an equation
in the form y equals we know that it's
going to open up or it's going to open
down since the x squared term has a
negative coefficient our parabola opens
downward and just to show you this
equation is the one I have shown graft
this equation is still the same and this
one is identical as well all three
equations represent the same parabola
that opens down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
