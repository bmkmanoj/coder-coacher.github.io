find this best line so again there's an
infinite number of lines how do we find
one that fits these points the best and
again we're defining best fit as the one
that has the least squared error where
the error is going to be the sum of the
distances between these X points and the
Green Line that we took we fit I'm not
even sure that this really is the best
fit in this case I just kind of hand
drew it so okay so is this something
that we that we would want to solve by
hill-climbing which is to say we kind of
pick the the slope and the intercept of
the line and we just kind of try
different values of this until it gets
better and better and then we can't get
any better and we stop can we do this
using calculus can we use random search
we just like pick a random M pick a
random B and C for happy with it or is
this the sort of thing where we probably
just want to go and ask a physicist
because it involves like continuous
quantities and we're discrete people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
