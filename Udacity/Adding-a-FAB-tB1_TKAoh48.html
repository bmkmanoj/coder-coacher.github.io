our promoted action let's create one the
design support library implements all
the features one would have to build
into a fab like touch elevation and
interaction with other elements some
features like ripples are not supported
in all versions of Android even with the
use of the support library depending on
when your project was created or what
version of Android studio you used to
create it the project might already have
some of the things I'm going to add on
the other hand you'll likely come across
a legacy app that you would need to
update so it's good to know what to look
for first you'll need to add these two
lines to your build that Gradle file
I'll explain why we need app compat in
just a second the design library adds
several widgets and layouts that make
implementing material design much easier
22-point 2.0 was the most recent version
at the time of recording but use
whatever is the latest and greatest so
here's our definition of the floating
action button that would be in our
layout file so as you can see some of
these attributes are on the app
namespace and some are on android
namespace let's focus on the app ones so
as Nick mentioned before the fab can be
normal-sized or mini
this corresponds to 56 dips next we have
an elevation a resting elevation for our
floating action button we want that to
be 6 dips one thing that might be new is
the layout gravity assuming a
left-to-right layout system and as a
synonym for write so it should layout
the fab to the right of whatever element
or your layout next is the press
Translation see property of 12 dips so
when this button is pressed we want it
to raise to a total of 12 dips that's
followed by a bunch of attributes here
that you've probably already seen before
so we're not going to go over these
point-by-point right now now if we try
to build this right now it'll refuse to
run properly Android studio will first
complain that there was an error
inflating the floating action button
that's because the fab needs app compat
for style information to resolve this
last error we need to replace instances
of material with app compat and then
you're all set your fav will elevate and
show ripples when touched and you can
treat it like any other button in your
UI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
