and our Android manifest is almost done
but because we're using Google services
there is one meta tag that we need to
add and that's just to specify that
we're using the Play services library we
do that like this the metadata tag is
used within the application tag it
should be a sibling of the activity not
a child within that you specify an
Android name is comm do Google Android
GMs Don version and the value for this
is at integer slash Google Play services
underscore version now as you can see
here it's showing up red it's showing up
there's an error account resolve symbol
we're gonna fix that in a moment and
also once that's been fixed once it's
been there your applications been
configured to use these services
libraries whenever you compile this will
be filled in automatically with the
correct number so let's go ahead and do
that so in order to do that there's one
other place that we need to ensure that
we're using the libraries for the
services and that's in the build up
Gradle for the app itself so if I go
into the build up Gradle for the app
down here you can see the dependencies
at the bottom of build our Gradle we're
gonna add a new dependency in here so
what we want to add is quite simply to
compile calm dog Google that Android GMs
: Play services : 6.5 plus now it's
important to note that your version here
may be different it depends on what
you're using and what version of Play
services you've installed you can take a
look in your system to see what versions
have been installed for you and I'm just
using this plus just to make life a
little bit easier I believe I've 6.5 dot
0.87 and but of course by the time
you're watching this play services might
be in version 7 or later and as you can
see here you should avoid using + and
version numbers because it can lead to
unpredictable behavior but I'm just
gonna leave it in for the time being for
simplicity but do note when you're
building your applications that you
should use the correct version number
here so now once we've done this we're
going to go to our main activity and
we're going to access the location
provider now in our main activity
remember that it contains just a single
textview and when the user runs the app
we wanted to get the current location
using location services and write the
latitude of the car
location into that text view in order to
do this we're going to need to write
some code in the activity this code will
create the Google API client and set up
the required callbacks to catch
responses back from location services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
