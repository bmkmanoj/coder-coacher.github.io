what tit for tat does against various
strategies let's try to think about what
we should do against tit for tat so what
do we do if we're facing tit for tat so
I'm just gonna break it down to two
possibilities it turns out there's
actually more but these these two are
pretty instructive so let's pretend that
we have to choose between always defect
as a way of playing against tit for tat
or we have to be always cooperate
playing against for tit for tat so what
I've written down here is what the total
discounted reward is going to be or the
total reward in this case as a function
of gamma so let's start with what
happens if you play always cooperate
against tit for tat well you already
told me that it such a thing will result
in to protect all ways cooperating
mm-hmm and that means that we're gonna
play in this box the cooperate cooperate
box and that means on every single round
we're gonna get a -1 which means over an
infinite run we're gonna get an average
of 1 sorry negative 1 over 1 minus gamma
mm-hmm with that I do just minus 1
repeated over and over again now always
defect as you recall you told me that
that will result well for the always
defect agent against tit for tat the
first thing that's going to happen is
it's going to defect while the tit for
tat cooperates right so we're gonna get
0 for playing that strategy on the first
round 0 doesn't sound very good but look
at the alternatives they're all negative
so 0 is pretty good mm-hmm so does this
sort of you know good thing in the first
step then after that tit for tat
responds by always defecting in response
right and that means we're gonna be
stuck in this box the defect defect box
where you get minus sixes for the rest
of ever yes so that means minus 6 over 1
minus gamma but that starts one step
from now so we multiply it by another
gamma ok all right so these are two
different expressions that represent
what our payoff will be for adopting two
different strategies and in fact if
gamma is really high very close to 1
then this is a really good answer right
because it sort of grows it's like minus
1 over 1 minus gamma so for high gamma
we're talking about something that's
minus 1 times a really big number mm-hmm
whereas this first one is not so good
for high gamma the
because what's going to happen is it's
gonna get end up getting -6 on every
step so it's gonna do worse overall but
if we're talking about a low gamma then
let's say you know zero for example a
gamma of zero will always defect we'll
get zero plus zero but always cooperate
we'll get negative 1 over 1 and zero is
better than minus 1 so for really small
gamma like if the game's unlikely to
last many rounds you should defect but
if the game is gonna last a long time
then you should cooperate I believe that
cool all right so then my question to
you is what's the value of gamma for
which these two different strategies to
play against tit for tat or equally good
I think I know the answer
whoa that was fast let's give everybody
else a chance to think about it
ok go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
