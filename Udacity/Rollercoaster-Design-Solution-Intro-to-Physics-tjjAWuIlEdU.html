has potential energy over here it will
also have potential energy because at
the top of the loop the car is still
some distance off the ground and so what
I'm doing here implicitly is using the
ground as my zero point of potential
energy know if this is a circular loop
this height is going to be to our but it
will also have some kinetic energy here
so from an energy point of view the
potential energy up here is getting
converted well to both potential energy
and kinetic energy so let's set up that
equation well here's my equation
expressing the conservation of energy
potential energy goes to potential plus
kinetic the mass is canceled and
remember I'm solving for the minimum
height so I'm going to set this velocity
equal to the minimum possible velocity
that the car could have as it goes
through this loop when I work this out I
get a minimum height of 25 meters if I
make the first hill any lower than that
the car will not have enough energy to
make it safely around this loop and you
might have some people falling out of
the car which isn't the best idea when
designing a roller coaster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
