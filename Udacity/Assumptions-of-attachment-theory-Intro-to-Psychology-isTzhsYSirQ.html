attachment on two fundamental
assumptions first a responsible and
accessible caregiver creates a secure
base for a child's development second
the primary bonding relationship becomes
a mental mold for all future friendships
and loved relationships so here humans
are the most defenseless and vulnerable
creatures on the planet the first few
months after they're born we have
virtually no ability to do much of
anything except for cry and nurse
therefore during the first few years of
life having a stable reliable and
accessible caregiver is crucial for
one's physical growth cognitive growth
and social growth it's just crucial for
our very survival if the caregiver is
neglectful or doesn't look after the
baby's needs or even abuses them then
all aspects of the child's development
can be stunted and here if a secure
attachment forms between the caregiver
and the cared for or the child then the
child grows up thinking that this is how
a relationship works they're reliable
and they're a source of security and all
future friendships and love
relationships start with this assumption
likewise if a child is neglected and
didn't form a secure attachment then
that's the Assumption the person takes
with them through all of their life
relationships</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
