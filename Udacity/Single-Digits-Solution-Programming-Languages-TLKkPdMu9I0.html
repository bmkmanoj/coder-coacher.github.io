write out all of the strings that this
matches 0 1 2 all the way up to 9 10
different one digit strings 0 is
certainly in this set so zero matches 0
through 9 1 matches 0 through 9 remember
the interpretation is everything between
and including the beginning up to and
including the end 10 however is a two
letter string it's too big this regular
expression only matches ten strings that
are each one letter long this one
doesn't match similarly 11 it's just too
large 05 is very tempting but regular
expressions are string equations not
mathematical equations so while 5 and 0
5 might have the same mathematical
meaning our regular expression which is
concerned with strings matches this one
letter string 5 but not this two letter
string 0 5 and then 9 well that's right
on the border we totally match it Isaac
Dennison we don't match this for a
number of reasons first it doesn't
contain zero through nine and second
it's much too long Isaac denison was a
pseudonym adopted by Karen Denison a
Danish author who wrote out of Africa
let's imagine that's Africa so these
regular expressions sound super cool and
I'm going to show you how to use them in
Python programs but that's going to
require one more step</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
