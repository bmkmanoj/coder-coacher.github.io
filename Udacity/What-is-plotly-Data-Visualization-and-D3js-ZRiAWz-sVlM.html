so good to have you here it's great to
be here
you know I I came here to do two things
chew bubblegum and talk about graphing
and I'm all out of bubblegum yeah
excited to be here great so tell us what
is Paulie
so we're graphing an analytics platform
and the idea behind it has been that we
want really two things one is for anyone
at any level of technical sophistication
to be able to make a really pretty
interactive and collaborative graph so
in the same way that you might make
graphs you know with Google Docs or you
know editing documents with Google Docs
we want people to be able to edit and
analyze data and make graphs together
online and we'd like that to be
something that's useful for high
schoolers and then also all the way up
to folks who are working on technical
and sophisticated projects so we have
corporations and folks at the Washington
Post who are using it too so first part
is anyone at any level making and
sharing graphs and then the second part
is being able to have it be a hub for
your data and your graphs and your code
and your collaboration so typically when
you make a graph you have some data and
then you analyze it and then you use
either code or maybe a program like
Excel or tableau to make your graph and
then you email about it and so you have
to put all of those things into an email
or into you know shared folder and then
other people kind of have to look at it
locally and check out the data
themselves but for us we've tried to
make it so all of that happens of code
graph data and collaboration all in one
place and it happens between languages
so you can edit graphs with any language
or with just our web app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
