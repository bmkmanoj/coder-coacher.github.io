flows brings us to the scaling algorithm
one idea is to find the heaviest
possible flow we could do this by
starting with an empty graph and then
adding an edge with the largest
remaining residual capacity until there
was an ST path but this would be
unnecessarily slow instead we fix a
schedule of thresholds for the residual
capacity and lower the threshold when
there are no more augmenting paths in
the residual Network
we'll start by defining the residual
network with threshold Delta to include
only those edges whose capacities is at
least Delta note that when Delta is
equal to 1 this is the same as our
traditional definition for a residual
Network we can state the algorithm as
follows we initialize the flow to 0 and
the parameter Delta to be the largest
capacity coming out of the source this
is a trivial upper bound on the value of
a single path flow then while Delta is
at least 1 we look for an augmenting
path in the residual graph with
threshold Delta and we use this path to
augment the flow once all such paths are
exhausted we then cut Delta in half and
repeat some of the analysis we can do
just by inspection letting see but the
initial value for Delta it's clear that
we only use log C iterations of the
outer loop since we're cutting Delta in
half each time and the steps of the
innermost loop here finding a path and
using P to augment the path are
certainly order e the big question then
is how many iterations of the inner loop
are there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
