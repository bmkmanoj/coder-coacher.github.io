the values but the values can actually
be anything we want they could even be
other dictionaries so if we wanted to
make a more interesting version of
elements so we'll start with an empty
dictionary and we can add a new element
this time we'll use the atomic symbol as
the key and we'll make the value of the
element a dictionary that provides some
information about it so we've added an
element to our dictionary the key is the
single letter H and it has as its value
a dictionary that has three entries with
the key name number and weight and
values associated with each of those
that could be different types name is a
string which gives the full name of the
element we'll add another element to our
dictionary and so for helium we have the
same name number and weight keys and so
for helium we have an extra entry that
says it's a noble gas and the value of
noble gas is true so now we can look up
the element H we'll see its entry again
note that it's a dictionary so the order
is not the same as the order that we
used here but we can do another lookup
so now we're looking up L MNH that gets
us the dictionary here and then we're
looking up in that dictionary the value
name and that will give us the name of
the element whose symbol is H we could
change this to look up some other
property let's look up the weight and we
can change the element to look up the
value for helium instead of for hydrogen
and now we get the four point zero two
which was the weight of helium if we
look up the noble gas property we get
true for helium what's going to happen
if we look it up for hydrogen so here we
get an error and we get the same error
that we got before when we tried to look
lithium up in the elements that didn't
include lithium as a key we're looking
for the key noble gas but it doesn't
exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
