genome and only 23 pairs of chromosomes
for them to fit this means that they're
going to be a lot of genes that end up
on the same chromosome now if we only
focus on let's say two genes that each
have two alleles apiece and they're on
the same chromosome and we look at the
allelic combinations we could get after
meiosis and our gametes we'd find that
instead of getting four we'd only end up
with two and this would appear to break
the rule of independent assortment that
says all these alleles can segregate
independently and we get all these neat
combinations well if the point of sex to
increase this genetic variability then
we need a way around this problem and
our germ cells have a really cool trick
to do this and make sure that we can mix
and match all of our alleles it's time
we move back to visual representations
of our chromosomes because this really
cool trick called chromosome
recombination is a bit more complicated
than what we can do with our deck of
playing cards again we're not going to
show all 46 chromosomes or all 23 pairs
I'm just going to show a representative
set of chromosomes here here we have one
two three four five six seven eight
pairs of chromosomes of course each pair
has one chromosome from mom and pink
here and one chromosome from dad and
blue now chromosome recombination is a
very special kind of event now in the
exercise we just looked at we had an
individual heterozygous for lactase
persistence and dwarfism but we
hypothetically imagine that these
alleles were on the same chromosome
chromosome 2 and because of this after
meiosis occurred we only got two
possible allelic combinations because
these alleles are on the same
chromosomes so the law of segregation
still applies but independent assortment
where alleles from one genus or
independently from alleles of another
gene doesn't seem to hold true instead
these alleles appear linked what a
special trick does called chromosome
recombination is it allows regions of a
chromosome to actually swap information
what this means is that physically
literally these chromosomes are touching
each other right one of these
chromosomes came from mom one of these
chromosomes came from dad they're going
to get so close that they're going to
connect at regions along the chromosomes
and where they connect they're going to
exchange pieces of information so that
what happens is a bit of mom and dad's
chromosomes get mixed up they get
swapped so now this one linear
chromosome that used to be the whole
chromosome that you got from mom is now
a chromosome that starts as a piece you
got for mom then includes a bunch of
sequence you got from dad and then more
sequence you got from mom so when you
pass these chromosomes on to your
children you're not just passing down
mom's chromosome that she gave you or
dad's chromosome that he gave you you're
passing down a mix of your mom and dad's
chromosomes now think about what this
means for the allelic compositions let's
just imagine for a second that the
placement of our lactase and dwarfism
alleles are here on the chromosomes and
we know already that if recombination
doesn't occur we only get two possible
allelic combinations here but if
recombination does occur look what
happens now where's the dominant and
recessive alleles were on the same
chromosome here you have the two
dominant alleles for each trait on the
same chromosome and the two recessive
alleles together so that when
segregation occurs we get the two
missing combinations that we didn't have
before so just to make sure you're with
me again I want you to tell me how many
gamete genotypes are possible in this
case even when genes are on the same
chromosome but far enough apart for
chromosome recombination to occur</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
