bluej you have a couple options for how
to start one is to open the test prog
bluej project that we made for you it's
in the files for lesson 1 the other
option is to make a new project using
bluej to open the test prog project open
up bluej click the project menu and then
from the drop down select open project
use the window that pops up to navigate
to wherever the lesson 1 code is
double-click an open test prog it should
look something like this if you
right-click you can open the editor and
then you have a main method all set up
and ready to go for you where you can
put whatever code you want to try out if
instead of using the test prog project
that we made for you you want to make a
new project you would go to the same
project menu select new project and then
give it a name some examples are
compiler runtime errors hello whatever
your project is going to be about I'll
just call this one a new project now I
close whatever project I had opened
before and I can see my new project
before I can write code in it though I
have to click new class and then come up
with a name I'll just call this one
testing an idea for now now you edit
this the same way you always would open
editor and there's a lot of stuff in
here
I always just delete it except for the
class definition and then add back
whatever code I need to try out the
thing I want to try again you can put
whatever code you want in here now that
you've seen how to make a new testing
project let's put that skill to use
we're going to try out some code</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
