working memory and long-term memory such
as episodic or semantic memory but how
do we get information to our long-term
memory well there are four steps to
long-term memory formation
there's encoding consolidation storage
and retrieval let's first start by
looking at encoding so the first out of
the four steps of turning information
into long-term memory as we said is
encoding this means that we intend to
new information we take it in and then
we process the new information so our
brain focuses on something new takes it
in and we process that information that
is us encoding new information now the
key here is at end it's important to
remember that we have to pay attention
attention is what drives the process of
encoding that is we have to pay
attention to and be aware of the
information that we're trying to
remember now there are two types of
encoding one type of encoding is termed
automatic processing as the name implies
it refers to encoding information that
occurs with little effort or conscious
attention to the task remember at the
beginning of the lesson when we asked if
you remembered what you had for
breakfast
this is an example of the kind of
automatic processing we're talking about
so although you may have encoded what
you had for breakfast this morning by
the evening you may have forgotten it
because it took a little effort or
conscious attention to the task the
second type of encoding for long-term
memory is termed effortful processing
effortful processing happens when we
carefully pay attention to information
and try to make a conscious effort to
remember the information for example the
type of semantic memories that we have
such as remembering the names of the
presidents of the United States or
trying to remember the names of all the
continents these involve our ability to
consciously pay attention to information
and to put an effort into retaining this
information while you take notes for
this class or watch our videos you're
engaging in effortful processing because
you're trying to retain the information
that you've learned at least I hope so
so how do we go about engaging an
effortful processing psychologists
theorize levels of processing relate to
our ability to more deeply encode
information so that our recall improves
let's go into a little more detail about
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
