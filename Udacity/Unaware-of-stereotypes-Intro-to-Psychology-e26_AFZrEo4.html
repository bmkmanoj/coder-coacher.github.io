even aware of have you ever heard of
these stereotypes athletes are dumb
blondes are dizzy or even professors are
absent-minded now we don't endorse these
stereotypes but they are in fact
stereotypes and as we'll see stereotypes
can help us save time and they allow us
to make an impression of somebody that
we don't know very well however even
though stereotypes can save time they
can have negative results so what we'll
see in this lesson is that stereotypes
can be inaccurate they can be
self-perpetuating they can be overused
and they can be automatic let's look at
the idea of a stereotyping
self-perpetuating in a little more
detail for example let's say you have a
stereotype that professors are older men
who listen to classical music and drink
fine wine now if you meet somebody who
doesn't fall into that stereotype we're
actually likely to ignore that
information for example you meet a
professor who is a young woman who
listens to rock and roll and drinks beer
in this situation we may modify our
stereotype and the woman would be the
exception to the rule however the
stereotype that professors are men who
listen to classical music and drink wine
will remain</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
