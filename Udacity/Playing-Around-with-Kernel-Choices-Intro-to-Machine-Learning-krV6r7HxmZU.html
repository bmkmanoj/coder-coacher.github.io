kernels let's go back to the SK learn
documentation and see how kernels are
supported in the actual code see if
there's different kernels that we could
give a try and see how those affect the
decision boundary that our SVM gives us
so okay I'm back at the page where we
were a few videos ago now I'm looking at
these at these some of these points a
little bit more carefully and one of the
things that I I notice is that there are
different kernel functions they can be
specified for the decision function so
there's common kernels that I can use
straight out of the box great and
there's also the option for custom
kernels if I want to get really fancy
will be just using the common kernels
that you can use out of the box but that
might be really interesting things to
play around with is to write your own
kernel so there are several different
svms
within scikit-learn that you could use
the one that we're using is SVC the
support vector classifier okay and that
takes me to another documentation page
of the support vector classifier and I
have this box at the top this might be a
little bit reminding you of what we were
seeing in the naive Bayes documentation
earlier so we have this whole
complicated thing here and tells me how
I can create my SVC and I notice that
there's all sorts of arguments all sorts
of parameters that I can pass when I'm
creating it one of these happens to be
the kernel now let me take you back to
the code that we wrote you might
recognize this from our last quiz and
one of the lines of code that I gave you
that I said we would explain later was
this line right here where I'm creating
the classifier so this line of code
would work if these parentheses were
just empty inside but they're not what
I've done is I've specified a kernel so
the first example where we had that
straight line decision boundary this is
using a linear kernel makes sense so now
I have a quiz for you
this is a little bit of a tough quiz
because I haven't shown you exactly how
to answer this question yet but I've
given you a big hint the answer is on
this page right here of the
documentation the question for you is
which of the following are SVC kernels
that we can use your options are linear
poly RBF sigmoid or all of these options
plus more so which of these kernels are
are available to you when you're using
the SK learn SVC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
