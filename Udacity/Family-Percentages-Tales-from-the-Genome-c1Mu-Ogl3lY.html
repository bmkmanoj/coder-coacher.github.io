some of these relationships pretty
intuitive let's start over here with the
close ones you would be fifty percent
related to your sister and fifty percent
related to your mother remember we just
got done talking a few exercises ago
about how that fifty percent is not the
same kind of fifty percent you're also
twenty-five percent related to your
grandparents and your aunts and uncles
of course this is because an individual
parent is half related to each of their
parents so if you're fifty percent
related to your parent half of that
would be twenty-five percent now you're
twelve point five percent related to
each of your great-grandparents as well
as your granduncle's the siblings of
your grandparents so I don't know if
you're noticing a trend here we've got
this set of fifty percent right and then
this set of twenty-five percent and then
this set of twelve point five percent
and now we also need to include first
cousins in this and then we move one
more out we would have great-great
grandparents and whatnot and then we'd
have a first cousin once removed at six
point two five percent and our second
cousin to be three point one to five
percent roughly notice it at each
extension we've essentially cut it in
half from fifty half of that is 25 half
of that is 12.5 half of that is 6.25
half of that is 3.125 now because of
recombination during meiosis these
numbers are not exact this is not
exactly we could put a little about sign
a little tilde in front of each of these
to represent that you're going to have
on average a 25-percent 12.5 percent so
forth and so on about the only
relationship that you can guarantee
you're going to be exactly fifty percent
is the father and the mother everything
else has recombination playing a role
and because that doesn't happen the same
way every time you can get a little more
a little less from one relative or
another this is just an approximation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
