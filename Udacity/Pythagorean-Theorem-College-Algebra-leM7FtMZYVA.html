in daily life for rational numbers since
we can count many things or just can
split them into parts that we can
measure but there are certain situations
that might not be quite this simple
let's say that you have a little cousin
and she wants you to build her a slide
this isn't just any slide though your
cousin is very particular she wants the
slide to be exactly 8 feet high and she
wants it to go from a trainer backyard
down into the lake by her house which is
12 feet away from the tree now you need
to figure out how long the slide will be
so that you can buy enough material to
make it you know that there is a rule
for the right triangles the Pythagorean
theorem that says that the side lengths
of a right triangle a B and C where C is
the longest side fit the formula a
squared plus B squared equals C squared
since the slide the tree and the ground
make a right triangle with the slide
itself as the longest side you know that
you can begin to look for the length of
the slide by first taking 8 squared plus
12 squared which is just 8 times 8 plus
12 times 12 for starters what is this
number please type the number of your
answer into the box right here remember
to do your multiplication before your
addition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
