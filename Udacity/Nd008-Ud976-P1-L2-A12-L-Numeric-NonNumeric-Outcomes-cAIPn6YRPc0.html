predicting numeric and non-numeric
outcomes well use these examples
throughout the rest of the lesson let's
use three examples a tricycle
manufacturer a marketing organization
and a bank for our first example imagine
that a manufacturer wants to use
historical production data to know how
many tricycles they'll need to produce
over the next six months to meet
expected demand since the outcome the
manufacturer wants to predict is a
number then the target variable is
numeric therefore they would use a
numeric or regression model to solve
this problem for our second example hot
and fresh pizza wants to use sales data
from their existing stores and
respective demographic data around those
stores to predict how many pizzas
they'll sell at their new store location
since the outcome that hot and fresh
beats is trying to predict is the number
of pizzas then the target variable is
numeric and they would use a numeric or
regression model to solve this problem
and for our third example a bank wants
to use historical data of their clients
to predict whether a new customer will
default on a loan always pay on time or
sometimes pay since the outcome the bank
is trying to predict is a category that
the new customer will fall into they
would use non-numeric or classification
models to solve this problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
