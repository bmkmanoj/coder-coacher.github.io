everyone's heard of Watson IBM's Watson
and everybody knows that Watson won
jeopardy I think a lot of people realize
IBM is now trying to move Watson into
healthcare the results you just
described are really amazing do you
think that we're heading into an error
down the road where tools like Watson
are going to replace doctors so first
before answered that question first I
want to give a little background about
how wasin competing jeopardy I mean
besides the advanced analytics
techniques they have used the amazing
natural language processing pipeline
they have developed another secret i
think is very important for the success
of watson winning jeopardy is the reach
training data source that are available
that regard me related to jeopardy
challenge in fact there is a website
called j archive com that that record
all the historical competition in the
past in jeopardy since 1983 and a lot of
those questions are general knowledge
that are there associate wikipedia
articles that provide very rich meta
information that about those about those
questions so those two important data
sources helped the Watson team to
develop their their algorithms to train
their algorithm on those historical
questions so that lead to a very amazing
result but in medicines neither of those
sources are available there is no good
questions database or question answer
database that available there's no good
matter information related to all those
clinical concepts so it's a lot more
complicated even to get to that stage so
what they have done I mean before I left
is a look at the u.s. licensing medical
licensing exam questions and trying to
let's tackle that first because those
are the available question and answers
but just the space if the medical domain
is so large and the question and answers
are a lot of times there's no clear yes
no answers so it's a lot harder but
there are many clinical institution are
very interested in using wasn't orders
very big medical research center like MD
Anderson holy I mean sloan-kettering me
more cancer centers they all partners
was Watson to to use wasson for their
diagnosis so that's that's definitely a
promising direction I hope they succeed
it's fascinating speculate about what
what's something like Watson might be
able to do if you could train it on that
fast amount of data so as you look ahead
for the next few years five years or so
where do you think we're going to be in
terms of big data and analytics and
healthcare yes so there's definitely
very hot area big data analytics in
healthcare and so it's there is a
paradigm shift from the traditional more
small-scale statistical approach to a
more system approach when I say system I
mean computing system so they're not
single algorithm that going to work it's
a pipeline of sophistic computational
tasks that put together and running a
very scalable platform like high
performance computing centers or in in a
cloud environment like Amazon Web
Services so in particular I think there
is a great need for making the data more
usable using analytics techniques so
there's a new push called phenotyping
that really means how do you convert
those messy electronic health records
into meaningful clinical concepts using
algorithms rather than require the data
to be good begin with why don't we
develop algorithm that
can automatically clean the data and
turn them into more usable high-quality
data that can be can support research
and discovery so that's the phenotype in
effort that a lot of people are working
on that's about the input to the
analytics platt platform then there's
the middle part where people trying to
boot those analytics predictive
analytics they used to take months right
for every disease target every data set
you have to spend months just to get the
right data hbu the motto then validated
that but now everybody want to use
predictive analytics and there's
thousands of diseases and conditions
people want a beauty mark for so how can
you scale up to view those model quickly
you need a very scalable and large-scale
platform to support that so a lot of
people leveraging parallel computing and
like mapreduce to do that kind of work
that's the processing part and also
finally the output right so we so far
only talk about accuracy and how good
the models are but in order to make use
of those model in clinical decision
support you really have to make the
model intuitive so that the decision
maker like clinician dr. cannerts tan
can explain that result to the patients
so that they believe and follow through
the recommendation and their work on
leveraging similar patients the history
and recommend what happened to those
worked for the similar patient to the
current patient as an intuitive method
to explain the recommendation so that's
final output part when so all the entire
system input processing and output need
to be new computational method and I
think that's a very promising future
that for healthcare analytics well thank
you very much I think you've really
helped the students understand not only
where we are but to see that there are
many many years of interesting research
and development ahead of us so maybe
some of the students will decide to to
join that which would be a
a result so thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
