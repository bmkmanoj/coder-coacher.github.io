have either ordered lists or unordered
lists we've got our list L so let's
first think about ordered list so an
ordered list let's say it goes from
smallest to largest inserting a new
element into the list so that it and it
has to stay ordered now because this is
an ordered list that involves running
through the list while possibly jumping
around in the list we could do what's
called binary search to actually find
the position where something needs to go
quickly but then actually sticking it
into the list involves copying all of
the elements moving them over shifting
them and then sticking the new one in
the list so this inserting into an
ordered list is a linear time process
right we have to maintain this this
sordidness property for an unordered
list it's actually quite a bit easier
well let's stick with ordered list for a
moment so so we're still with an ordered
list what about finding and removing the
minimum so finding the minimum in this
sorted list is really easy it's right
there right at the than those in this
first spot so finding it is easy and
deleting it depending on exactly how we
how we deal with this we don't want to
recopy the whole array but if we could
sort of just chop off the front and move
over a little bit then we can actually
find and delete the men from an ordered
list in constant time so that's really
great once it's sorted we can actually
find as many men's as we want and it's
very very cheap all right so now we
consider the unordered case in the
unordered case inserting into the list
is so easy we just just you know stick
it on the end just extend the list a
little bit so that's a constant time
operation but what about finding and
removing them in well this is the
problem that we were looking at earlier
in the unit where we have to scan
through to find where the min is and to
remove it we have to copy things over to
fill in the hole so that is actually a
linear time operation so we have these
kind of two extreme choices that we can
we can make we can look at an ordered
list we're inserting is slow but look
but removing the smallest is easy or we
can use an unordered list we're
inserting is easy and finding and
removing the min is hard notice we
didn't use this sort of middle middle
ground at all what we
what a heap is going to give us is a way
of actually both doing inserts and find
and removing them in in logarithmic time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
