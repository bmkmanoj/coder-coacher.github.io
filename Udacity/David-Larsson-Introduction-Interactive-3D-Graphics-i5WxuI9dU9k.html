david larson david was the lead
developer on a product called beast for
game developers many of the lighting
demos you'll see in this unit were
developed by David so David as a start
what's your background I got a Commodore
128 as a Christmas gift my brother and I
got it together and we started
programming and exploring this basic
environment which which is basically the
operating system but also a programming
language which you end up in when you
boot up one of those computers and I was
kind of reading over the shoulder and
asked my brother to you know type in
listings from computer magazines and
instruction manuals and we you know
started making programs and that's kind
of how we got started programming
together and when I was growing older I
got involved in something called the
demo scene which is basically just
teenagers trying to outdo each other
with graphics effect and visual effects
on computers and that was a really good
boot camp for for learning about
graphics programming and and programming
in general and also like you know
running projects it's so it was a really
effective way of learning all those
tools that you need in order to become a
good programmer so a few years I had a
time when I was in college I also you
know temporarily worked for a game
studio and then some time and when I was
in my last year of college a friend
actually another guy I knew from from
the demo scene he asked me if you I
wanted to come work for for the company
they had and that companies was
illuminated labs which is a at that time
we were developing a renderer that was
kind of a general-purpose rendering
renderer and at some point we realized
we have to narrow like focus group and
what we did was targeted towards game
developers and you know things got much
bigger and eventually we ended up being
acquired by Autodesk so that's where
I've been
for the last two and a half years</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
