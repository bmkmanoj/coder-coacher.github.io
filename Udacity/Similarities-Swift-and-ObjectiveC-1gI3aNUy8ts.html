building the portfolio apps for the iOS
nanodegree you've become intimately
familiar with the classes in foundation
and uikit those classes are bridge too
Swift but as you may know by now many of
those classes are actually written an
objective-c this means that the way
they're used in objective-c will look
and feel very similar to the way you use
them and swift let's take a look at an
example the following code snippets are
taken from a custom view controller
class that inherits from
uiviewcontroller in the code snippet
here you can see the familiar
uiviewcontroller method viewwillappear
the objective-c syntax will certainly
seemed for it at this point but let's
focus on what we can find in common
between the two implementations just as
you would do is Swift you start out by
calling the view will appear message of
the superclass after that you call any
methods necessary to prepare the view
before it appears in this case the
method display result by the way if you
ever find yourself needing more time to
read through the code examples
go ahead and pause the video let's take
a look at another example here are some
of the methods of the app delegate
protocol you'll notice that if you
create a new project template and xcode
whether it's an objective c or Swift the
same six app delegate methods appear by
default
i'm just showing the first four here but
you get the idea and here they are in
Swift and here they are an objective-c
these methods manage transitions between
the five main application states active
background not running inactive and
suspended these five states or language
agnostic and the transitions between
them are handled identically and Swift
and objective-c as an iOS developer
joining a new team digging through your
colleagues objective-c code you can
expect to see many familiar classes and
methods from UI kit and foundation let's
talk about another similarity between
iOS development and Swift's and
objective-c design patterns whether
you're writing and swifter objective-c
you'll be using principles like the
delegate and model-view-controller
patterns to guide the architecture of
your app for example in conjunction with
the delegate powder
both objective-c and Swift make
extensive use of protocols part of the
need for protocols stems from both
languages having single inheritance a
given class can only inherit from one
other class instead of multiple
inheritance both languages employ
protocols to share functionality across
unrelated classes
let's take a look at an example from the
familiar uitextfield delegate protocol
here's an implementation of this should
change characters and range method for a
text field accepting a zip code here it
isn't Swift and here it is an
objective-c here are the two signatures
together and here we see the body of the
method for each notice that the two
implementations are incredibly similar
the use of protocols across objective-c
and Swift engenders continuity across
iOS apps at the scale of a parka texture
and on a more granular scale as the two
languages employ many of the same
protocols</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
