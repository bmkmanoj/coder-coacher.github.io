whenever we suggest a solution approach
is Hawaii in particular whose pain point
are we trying to solve it turns out that
many operating system subsystems need
persistence for example file system it
has metadata such as I notes that say
where and how files are actually stored
on the disk and this data structure
which is the I know data structure is a
persistent data structure and while the
operating system may manipulate the data
structure but bringing it into main
memory for performance reasons finally
it has to put it back on the disk in a
persistent state once permanent changes
have been made to that data structure
and that's the reason why persistence is
very very important for building several
such subsystems a file system I gave you
as an example similarly runtime systems
of many languages may require support
for persistent objects that need to be
stored on permanent storage and all of
these subsystems what they would do is
in order to make it efficient from the
point of your processing they will have
in memory a cache copy of the persistent
data that lives on permanent storage
such as the disk but if and when changes
are made to those data structures that
are in memory they have to be committed
back to the permanent storage so that
there is consistency for actions that
are being taken by these subsystems so
how can we provide persistent support
for these subsystems well one
possibility is to make virtual memory
persistent because if you make the
virtual memory persistent then all the
data structures that are contained in
the virtual memory become automatically
persistent now the upshot of doing that
would be that the subsystems do not have
to worry about flushing the persistent
data structures from memory into the
disk because some of the layer in the
software stack is going to take care of
it if in fact we make virtual memory
persist
that also means that if the system were
to crash either due to power failure or
due to problems in the software meaning
software bugs recovering from such
crashes becomes easy because the data
structure is a persistent and anything
that was done in the virtual memory of
the process that represents that
subsystem is going to be available in
the persistent storage the question is
then who will use it well we are
expecting that the subsystem designers
will use such an abstraction if we
provided but subsystem designers also
care about performance and therefore
subsystem designers will use it only if
the abstraction is a performance
abstraction in other words it is not
enough to come up with an abstraction
but it is also important to make the
abstraction efficient so if an
abstraction is cheap to use easy to
understand and flexible then subsystem
designers will use it if it is not they
want so the question is if we want to
make virtual memory persistent can we
also make it an efficient implementation
of the abstraction of a persistent
virtual memory now how can we make it
efficient now if you think about it the
virtual address space of a process and
let's say that this virtual address
space represents the process that
belongs to a particular subsystem it may
have persistent data structures that are
strewn all over this address space and
if these data structures persistent data
structures are written into and if these
persistent data structures are
manipulated by the subsystem and if we
want them to be committed to the storage
then it requires that every time you
touch a persistent data structure in
memory version of it and modify it the
on disc version of that same data
structure need to be updated now what
that means is if these data structures
are spread out all over the virtual
address space that could result in many
IO operations first of all second it
could also mean that we may be writing
two different portions of the desk
and both of these are bad news because
disk by its very nature its electro
mechanical in nature and disc is electro
mechanical in nature and as a result
there are latencies associated with the
disc namely seek latency and rotational
latency and if the writing that we are
doing to virtual memory which is backed
up by the persistent disk is all over
the disk then it's going to result in
many random writes to the storage system
and random writes are going to be
resulting in very poor performance so
instead of doing this what we would like
to do is have what we will call a log
segment and the idea is very similar to
the log structured file system that we
have seen earlier when we discussed XFS
the idea is that when you're making
changes to the virtual memory and you
know what portions are very persistent
every time you write to a persistent
data structure that is in memory then
you write a log record that corresponds
to that change that you made to the
persistent data structure so this is the
change that you made to this persistent
data structure and this is the change
that you made to this persistent data
structure the log segment is itself a
data structure in support of these
subsystems when implementing the
persistent virtual memory we have this
log segment as a data structure that the
implementation uses to record changes to
persistent portions of the virtual
address space and because we are putting
it into this data structure called log
segment we can write this contiguously
and of course we have to commit these
changes to the disc but now you can see
the difference in the picture between
here and here here we were doing random
writes all over the disk but here we are
writing the changes to the persistent
data structures to contiguous portions
of a log segment and we can take this
and store this contiguously on the disk
and that's the attraction so these log
segments are going to be stored
contiguously on the disc and therefore
even though
we are making random writes in the
address space of the subsystem that we
are building that requires certain
persistent data structures because those
changes are being recorded as logs in a
log segment and we are committing the
log segment to the disk we can convert
these random writes to sequential writes
and writes sequentially on the disk so
two things we are accomplishing by doing
that the first is we are not making
individual IO operations for every time
we touch different portions of the
virtual address space because we are
writing it into this log segment which
may be an in-memory data structure and
therefore we are reducing the number of
i/o operations that we need in order to
commit these changes finally to the
storage and second because we are
writing this contiguously we don't have
the random writes that we talked about
all of these will help make the design
and implementation of a persistent
virtual memory much more efficient that
is the key idea which is there in the
paper that I've assigned to you for
reading which is the lr vm paper</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
