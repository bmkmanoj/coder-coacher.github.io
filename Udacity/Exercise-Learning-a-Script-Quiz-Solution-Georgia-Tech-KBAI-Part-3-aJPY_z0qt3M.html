so for learning a script I said the five
of the things we've talked about so far
would really help with agent learner
script so we've seen in the past that
semantic networks and frames are
representational a equivalent we saw
that when we put the Ravens progressive
matrices problems in terms of first
semantic networks and then converted
them to frames frames as we've seen are
very useful for storing the type of
information necessary to construct a
thorough script and if semantic networks
are representational equivalent then we
can also imagine a script composed of
semantic networks instead to skip the
middle couple for a second i can imagine
incremental concept learning being very
important to learning scripts we can
imagine an AI agent acting in the world
and encountering multiple events every
day and needing to start to kind of
develop a categorization scheme for
those different experiences so for
example that agent might learn that if
I'm developing a script for fast food
whether or not i see a McDonald's logo
or a Wendy's logo when I walk in is not
necessarily important to which script I
run but whether or not i see a counter
with cashiers behind it or a hostess
waiting to seat me is important so that
way an agent could use incremental
concept learning to learn the difference
between for example a fast food script
and a fine-dining script so the choke
discussed before planning happens when
an agent has an initial state and a goal
state and figures out how to navigate
between the two once they figured out
that plan for navigating between that
initial state in that goal state that
then becomes a script that could be
transferred to a new similar situation
without having to completely replan the
route from scratch then finally common
sense reasoning helps the agent out
because it gives the agent a kind of a
language within which to learn the
script in the first place it can learn a
script within this language of primitive
actions that it understands and then can
use those to make sense of new and novel
situations production systems and
learning by recording cases don't really
apply as much the scripts because they
both involve representations at a very
different level of abstraction at a very
low level of abstraction with learning
by recording cases we tend to stick to
the cases whereas scripts we have an
abstraction over them and production
systems are more like atoms of knowledge
representation is that a molecules or
compounds like we deal with the scripts
that's good David I add one other thing
regarding the semantic network recall
that when we discuss semantic networks
we had considered
we can use semantic networks to
interpret stories we'd use the same
example Ashok wanted to become rich you
got a gun and we said that inside the
semantic Network denotes that correspond
to Ashok wanted rich and gun get
activated and this activation spread
from there and as a pot gets formed its
parent semantic network that part then
is the interpretation of this particular
story in a sense a script is that part
of course if you think you see a
connection between production systems
are learning by recording cases and
scripts that I haven't seen or if you
think the connection between these other
topics and scripts is not quite as close
as I've described feel free to head over
to our forearms and we'll discuss it
there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
