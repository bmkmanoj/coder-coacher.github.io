the Python interpreter for this class
you don't need to install any new
software you can run Python right in
your web browser and you should see
something like this in your web browser
once the video stops there are two parts
to this there's the environment where
you can edit code so let's type code to
print three so print is a Python command
that print something out and then after
the print we can have any expression we
want that is valid Python and we'll talk
more about what expressions are in
Python now we're just going to print the
number three and when we click run it
will run this code and show us the
result down here and the result of
printing 3 we see the output 3 we can do
more interesting things so we can print
an arithmetic expressions so I've got 1
plus 1 now we run this we see both
outputs so first we printed 3 we see the
3 here then we printed 1 plus 1 we see
the result of 1 plus 1 is 2 we can write
this more clearly by having spaces we
can have spaces between the parts of our
expressions so we can have 1 plus 1 with
spaces between there that's a little
easier to read when we run that we see
the same result the result still 2 and
we can make more and more complex
expressions so let's print the result of
52 times 3 plus 12 times 9 this will
print out the result of multiplying 52
times 3 and adding that to multiplying
12 times 9 and we get 264 you can check
that yourself to see that Python got the
right answer we can use parentheses to
group expressions so if we use
parentheses we can do what we did before
by putting parentheses around grouping
the multiplications and grouping the
other multiplication when we run this we
see the same result without the
parentheses that means the same thing as
we had when we add the parentheses like
this if we put the parentheses in
different places it means something
different now what it means is 52 times
the result of adding 3 plus 12 which is
15 times 9 and so we get the result 70
20 so we can combine any
expressions that we want like this for
example if we wanted to compute the
number of seconds in a year we can
compose many multiplications so we'll
multiply 365 days times 24 hours in a
day times 60 minutes in an hour
times 60 seconds in a minute we can do
all those multiplications together and
we get this result which is about 31 and
a half million seconds in a year so now
it's time for your first programming
quiz you've seen enough to be able to
write a Python program and your goal is
to write a Python program that prints
out the number of minutes there are in 7
weeks which is the amount of time we
have for this course you'll do that by
entering your code in here and then you
can try different things you can try
running the code see the result and then
when you've got an answer you can click
to submit that answer and see if it's
correct</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
