Euclid's algorithm using javascript
we're not expecting you to be a
JavaScript guru but it's useful to know
the basic constructs when we're
developing our interpreter for it and
perhaps the best way to get familiar is
by programming something so Euclid's
algorithm incredibly simple it computes
the GCD or the greatest common divisor
so let's call our function GCD it takes
two inputs that are integers a and B if
a equals B we're going to return a if a
is greater than B we're going to
calculate the GCV of a minus B and B so
taking a step back the first one made
sense for given two numbers 36 and 36
it's pretty clear that the greatest
common divisor is 36 so we're just gonna
pick one what could have been B doesn't
really matter this next one may not be
as clear but you probably have some
intuition why it's true and we're going
to reserve a proof for it for an algebra
class that you might take in college or
in high school if a is less than B we're
going to calculate GCD of a and B minus
a so looking at all this together
it kind of looks like pseudocode and
actually it looks very close to the code
that we're going to write be it in
Python or JavaScript so let's get right
to it and I'll go over some of the
JavaScript the patient's and conventions
as I code this up but really this is it
so to declare a JavaScript function we
use the keyword function and then the
name of a function which we call GCD I'm
going to take in two inputs a and B and
now we have our function body and unlike
Python where you can just use tabbing
and whitespace to indicate what parts of
the code are blocks or kind of sub parts
of the rest of the code we use braces
and forgive my poor bracing technique
I've never gotten very good at this now
the first thing we're going to do is an
F if a equals B or in return a and if
you haven't already figured it out that
this is a recursive definition and we're
going to use it to write a recursive
function if a equals B we want to return
a that's just like we've said oh yeah
and don't forget your semicolons just
like I just did otherwise else
if a is greater than B we're going to do
GCD of a minus B and B always add your
semicolon finish your brace we have one
last case
so another else and we're done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
