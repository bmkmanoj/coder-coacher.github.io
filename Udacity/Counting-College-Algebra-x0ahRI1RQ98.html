quantities of objects and answer
questions about them whether it's how
many students are in a teacher's class
or how many moons orbit Saturn now
usually when we count we start with the
number one and then we get to two and
three four and so on and so forth and we
could keep counting like that until we
get to huge numbers like 1,000 or 1
million or 1 trillion and even then we
could still keep going now this special
set of numbers has a name they are
called the natural numbers so the
natural numbers start with 1 and
increase by ones forever so now we want
to make sure that you're totally solid
on what falls under this category which
of these numbers are natural numbers 735
6 89.1 negative a thousand one third and
19 this is a slightly different kind of
quiz than the last one this time I want
you to check off all of the answers that
you think are right so that might mean
checking more than one in some cases you
might even check off all of the answers
that are there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
