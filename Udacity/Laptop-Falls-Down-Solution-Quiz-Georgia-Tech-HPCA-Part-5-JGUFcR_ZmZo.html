laptop falls down quiz for the pavement
the failure is whatever causes the
pavement to no longer perform its
function properly here you might be
tempted to say that it needs to be
replaced is the failure but actually
that's the repair of the failure this is
fixing the pavement it's not something
that causes it to deviate from its
function really it breaking cause it to
need to be replaced so breaking is the
failure what's the fault it's the event
that resulted in the first error in this
case it's not that the laptop fell out
of the bag it had nothing to do with the
pavement it is that the laptop hits the
pavement and now what was the first
error well it was that the pavement
developed a crack the structure the
internal behavior of the pavement is no
longer the same as the proper pavement
but we really notice this in terms of
deviating from its specified function
when it broke so we can still use a
pavement with a crack the crack expanded
so the error became bigger but really
until it broke the pavement was
functioning properly so this is what we
get at the end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
