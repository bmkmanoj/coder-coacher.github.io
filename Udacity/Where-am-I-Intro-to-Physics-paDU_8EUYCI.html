you don't know where you are luckily you
have on hand the following information
you also have a knowledge of physics and
plenty of rocks your task is to find out
where you are are you on earth Mars
Pluto Jupiter or the moon now I say that
you have plenty of rocks and the reason
why this is useful is because you happen
to know a fact about yourself you
haven't know that on earth the farthest
you can throw a rock is 40 meters not
bad
so you devise a scheme you decide to
compare your abilities on earth to your
abilities on this new unknown location
you find that in this new unknown
location you can throw 250 meters this
is all I'm going to tell you from here
you're on your own can you tell me which
planet you're on and yes I know the moon
isn't really a planet and some people
will try to tell you Pluto wasn't either
but don't listen to them if you're
having trouble with this one because I
know this is a very tricky problem you
can go into the forums and look for some
help</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
