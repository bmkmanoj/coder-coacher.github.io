finally feel comfortable with your final
product so in terms of the the design of
the physical thing or the software the
interactions or which are part of it
from the side of the physical the
physical robot right so it could yeah
you're trying to really focus on how a
patient is going to engage with this and
it's very important that a patient
doesn't feel weird right right so how do
you kind of go about okay well this is
where we started this was okay you know
obviously we had the blue trashman
googly eye so I've done a Bluetooth
speaker right and then it's slowly it
seems like it slowly kind of built up
over time but there's a point where you
say okay I have all the function
components that I need but now I'm going
to change the design because the eye
doesn't look quite right or the head
isn't quite the right shape like what
kind of how did you go about making
those types of decisions sure what kind
of testing did you do like to a focus
group and then do you feel that right
now you're at a stable point with your
project so designing our maybe robot
Fork Italia health we actually have a
very fast process of designing that
actual robot right so the really early
stuff in terms of you know the trashcan
or you can see the the cardboard things
behind us here right those are really
for testing more the user experience not
the actual design the robot right we
simply deliberately separated these
things out the actual design of the
robot from beginning to end took us
about four to five weeks all right now
we went with you know I do a great
design firm worked with their San
Francisco studio pew blocks from where
we are now so I do is actually with the
early investors in our company we were
startup in resin so we spent five months
working right in the middle of their
studio the industrial design process for
this robot was like said about five
weeks so we went in with you know here
is the design brief the first week or so
was you know coming up with all sorts of
crazy ideas right so taking that in many
different directions things that look
you know all different you know designs
and styles and you know some things that
might be an appliance some things that
are like totally sci-fi some things that
there's you know no way we could ever
manufacture but starting off with it's
just this ideation phase
and from that we started to narrow down
alright so let's get rid of the things
they're just like totally weird and out
there we don't think people would ever
want let's get rid of things that you
know maybe we could manufacture but it
would cost us a whole lot of money and
as a start-up that's just not a good
thing right and that left us you know
with a smaller set of things and we
started putting those in front of people
all right so I wouldn't say it's you
know particularly focus groups but going
out to places where we could interact
with our potential patient population so
we help a lot of patients who tend to be
older not necessarily tend to be dealing
with chronic diseases and so you know
putting some of these designs in front
of people now at first I was tough on
paper right drawings on the computer
screen on paper getting some quick
feedback and we tried to really rapidly
iterate and narrow in on what might work
that's a combination of you know
feedback that we got from people but
also my experience of building stuff
like this for the last 15 years right by
the time we were doing that design and
so just an understanding then of what
people are going to react to so our
design brief going into that was really
simple one this needs have eyes right
because we know the power of this
psychologically right sometimes it
actually looks at you and makes eye
contact while it's interacting is very
important to we want to screen on it
speech technology is getting much better
okay so this was you know a couple years
ago the Amazon echo was out today we
have you know more devices like this
from you know Google and Apple and many
other things that we can talk to it's
definitely getting better there's a lot
more that you can do but in healthcare
we need to to make sure that we're
always very accurate so one of the
things that we do on the robot is when
she's speaking she's showing what she's
saying on the screen I can respond by
talking to her we're pressing a button
and sometimes you might want to say oh
hey do you remember when your doctor
showed you how to whatever right can I
show you that video again I said to be
able to do things like that so that was
criteria number two and then point
number three was we wanted this roughly
the size of a kitchen appliance all
right now we could build something
that's humanoid right as big as you were
made it's going to take up a lot of
space in our home right that's not great
for a lot of people we could make this
the size of a cell phone right possible
given the technology it's going to get
you know put by the bookshelf or you
know tossed in the kitchen drawer people
are going to forget about it too easily
so it's kind of roughly the size and so
you know with that set of criteria we
were able to then hole
in on some of these early designs say
okay here's the set of things that set
now okay we actually like this from this
one this from this one we'll put those
together and so just a very rapid
iteration process you know having a team
of professional industrial designers who
were focused on this project and able to
really quickly iterate let us go from
you know initial concept to basically
what we have today in a period of about
a month was there any other design or
talk about having the robot look more
lifelike so you know looking lifelike in
a robot could be good or bad I did and
that's a matter of perspective and
opinion I think there there are some
parts of the world where people are
really focused on designing robots that
might look very humanoid there's you
know this concept called the uncanny
valley that I'm sure you're familiar
with and we really don't want to fall
into the bottom of the uncanny valley
right this thing just ends up looking
very creepy given what we're doing also
again going back to you know where we
position ourselves as a company in
healthcare we want to make sure we set
up the right expectations all right so
uncanny valley is often talked about as
the look of this thing right you don't
want to look too humanoid but there are
also a lot of other expectations that
come out of that not just the appearance
but the overall interaction right so for
the same reason that we don't try to
make this look like a person we don't
make it sound like a person right now we
want a very intelligible voice so we
have a computer-generated voice that's
you know easy to understand but is not
human recorded speech and also for
similar reasons we don't have completely
open-ended conversations with us the
robots always directing the conversation
because we don't want to set up
expectations with our patients that this
can just talk about anything right you
can just sit down and talk to it because
then the expectations are too high so
you know with that set of things that
helps us to start making these decisions
about you know what this looks like how
humanoid should it be if you look at our
maybe robot it's you know you're never
going to confuse this for a person right
it's clearly yellow plastic right or or
in the near future other colors as well
right it has human-like features trying
to his eyes they're going to look at you
other - there's a head on there but the
rest of its you know the squat body in
the screen right so it's not like this
looks just like a human but enough of
those features to really draw on the
psychology
of interaction right something looks at
me I immediately look back right so
using those types of things in the
design are very important but trying to
make it look like a person you know one
is going to lead to the wrong
expectations and two is very expensive
right building a product like that
starts to get really difficult to
actually manufacture a scale for the
same reason that you have the eyes that
kind of look at you they're a constant
decision cannot make a mouth that moves
as well because you do fall into that
uncanny valley even though it would be
more of a like a computer synthesized
computer-generated voice that the you're
worried about the lips or the the mouth
kind of sinking up to the words and
making sure yeah so it's a combination
things right doing that is really hard
and use that's one thing you know too I
challenge you to go find a robot out
there that has moving lips it actually
looks good right it always ends up being
a little bit creepy
now maybe there are some out there I
haven't seen yeah there's a lot of
people working on stuff like this right
now to be great if there is but I think
for what we're doing
it doesn't necessarily add a lot of
value to it and people perceive this
thing as talking to them even though the
mouth is you know a smile line embedded
in the plastic it's not like there's
anything there that moves or even open
people have no problem talking this is
having a conversation and what I've seen
is again many robots out there do have
moving lips
none of them kind of cross that
threshold of not being creepy you're
just wrong alright and it's many of them
are now good enough and it's not like
movie you know that's weird
but there's the disconnect alright so
uncanny comes from Freud tunheim look
all right so this feeling that
something's just not quite right and
through a lot of the studies that I did
more than a decade ago we found that
many of the features that are not quite
right like that people aren't
necessarily going to say oh that's wrong
and be able to point that out and say
this is what this is a problem but if
you actually look at their experience
with this robot and you compare one
versus another then in that underlying
data about the psychology of the
interaction you can see these very clear
differences so part of it's just
learning these lessons about what things
work what things don't and then how do
we apply those in the design
in the future robot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
