I looked across the rows and tried to
see which features all three birds had
in common they all lay eggs so I'm going
to figure that birds lay eggs they all
have wings so I'm going to figure that
birds have wings and none of them have
fur so I'm going to figure that birds
don't have fur whether or not they have
talents can actually very so the eagle
and Bluebird have talons but the penguin
does not and whether or not they're
large can vary the eagle and penguin are
large but the Bluebirds not so those
things don't necessarily define what a
bird is but these three things seem to
me like they do that's a good answer
David but I should quickly note that
this idea that we can decide on the
features that should go into a
superclass given the features that are
shared among these subclasses works only
for certain kind of concept it doesn't
work for all concepts in particular work
for concepts that have a formal nature
as we will see in just a minute</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
