take a look at how to use it if you
don't already have this open open it
from your Applications folder when you
first open IntelliJ you'll see this
welcome screen and options to create a
new project import a project or open one
from a file and projects are ways to
organize different programs and group
functions together like you might want
to group together code for a game
project and have a separate project that
holds code for designing a website
projects just help us separate and group
our code in ways that make sense so
let's choose create a new project then
IntelliJ should show window that asks
for the Java SDK we want to use for our
project and this is why we needed to
install a Java development kit
beforehand so that we can use it in our
development environment here intellij
sometimes finds the correct JDK
automatically but if not you should
click this new button on the side and
then the JDK option and it should
automatically navigate to the home file
of your latest version of your JDK for
us that's JDK 1.8 and here's our home
folder so once that folder selected
click OK here it also asks for any
additional libraries and frameworks and
these are just collections of Java code
and functions that someone else has
written will just be using functions
that Java already has built in so we
aren't going to need any external code
so let's leave these unchecked and click
Next then IntelliJ will ask us if we
want to create a project from a template
and we will we only have one option here
called the command line app and remember
command line is another word for the
terminal or command prompt and so this
template will include some starting code
that will make it easier to write
compile and run our own code so once we
check this box it actually says this is
a simple java application that includes
a class with a main method and method is
just another name for a java function
and this main method is a special
function that will talk about more in a
bit so let's use this template and if
you forget to click this in future don't
worry we can always manually type in any
code we need so then click Next then
will be asked to give our project a name
it's always a good idea to give a simple
descriptive name will be making a simple
hello world program again so let's name
this project hello world next you'll see
this project location which is the
directory where all our projects will be
saved and IntelliJ creates a convenient
projects folder for us where it files
our projects under their project name so
I'll just keep this the way it is and
last is our base package that says
comdoc company if you are creating an
application to distribute to the web or
a mobile device that would require a
unique package name and you'd want to
change this but for going through this
example together and for practicing
writing code just use this default com
company and then click finish
and our project is set up you might see
these tips on startup and I'll just
close those next we'll go through how to
write the code for our hello world
program in this IntelliJ environment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
