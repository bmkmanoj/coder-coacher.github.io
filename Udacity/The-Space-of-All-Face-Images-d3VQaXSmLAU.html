well let me tell you i'm going to
introduce this using the notion of face
images because frankly it was this
eigenvector approach to doing face
recognition that released I think got
people's attention think of an image now
not as a two-dimensional thing but as
just one great big long vector okay so
it's just got a whole bunch of values in
it so for example suppose I had a vector
that was a hundred by a hundred long how
many pixels is that Megan hundred by a
hundred ten thousand ten thousand you
got it right 100 times 110,000 so that's
just a 10,000 long vector if I don't
worry about the fact that they're pixels
located in a particular position which
by the way is going to be an interesting
problem later if I just think of them as
values that's a ten thousand dimensional
space right there's 10,000 dimensions
each dimension has a value what's the
value it's the value of the pixel that
corresponds to that location this
location is another pixel its value 18
fine that's its value here so the idea
is that an image is just a ten thousand
dimensional vector question how many of
those ten thousand dimensional vectors
how many hundred by hundred pictures are
actually pictures of faces I mean just
of a face answer not a whole lot okay
fact most values right if I just
randomly put numbers in though that
vector right I get out you know Brandon
pixels everywhere all right the idea is
that faces are a very special set of
vectors they're not all possible vectors
and they're not distributed everywhere
in this image space they're on some
particular what's referred to as a sub
space sometimes manifold okay they're in
a subspace of all images okay by the way
we sometimes call that subspace
facespace let's face space it's the
subspace in the space of images that are
the pictures of faces alright so here's
what we want to do we and this is color
coded so we get we want to build
a low-dimensional because we're going to
try to get a nice dimensionality
reduction going on here linear we'll
talk about the use of linearity to be
able to just do dot products to get our
coefficient subspace so it's going to be
some reduced space that explains the
most of the variations seen in face
images and that's just drawn out here
this looks just like what we had before
where we had blue dots and orange dots
now I'm telling you well actually even
though this is drawn is just a
two-dimensional space because I can only
draw two it's a ten thousand dimensional
space 10,000 pics you like okay fine ten
thousand pixels and the idea is let me
find the direction or directions in that
image along which most of the face
images lie and that's what it shows here
that the cyan color is sort of ideas
that the face images are there and then
we've got all these other images that
are not images of faces their cats well
they're all sorts of things okay
whatever the internet has pictures of
and all other possible things all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
