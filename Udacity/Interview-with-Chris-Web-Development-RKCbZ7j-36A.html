talking with Chris Chu who is one of the
Udacity engineers and he's been working
on a pension and we're gonna talk a
little bit today about how you'd
actually uses App Engine in production
and some of the things that are
different from writing toy apps you know
we've been writing these simple things
and Udacity actually has thousands of
users and so it's a much different
problem that they're solving so we spoke
before about how when you when you
candied acid II you were skeptical about
App Engine and and you expect them to
try to have to convert people and how
has your experience been so far yeah
actually it's it's been interesting I
think a lot of people especially the
more engineering experience you have the
more skeptical you tend to be about
something that makes claims as big as
app engines claims and you know and
everything always has trade-offs in App
Engine has trade-offs but you know I
really did come to Udacity thinking that
I would be able to talk everybody out of
moving to something different where we'd
have a little bit more control and I
think the opposite has actually happened
I've been a little converted the other
way and I think you know App engines
really the perfect spot for you dassit
ii and s/ii really does run on App
Engine we really do have a lot of
traffic and there's even some larger
websites that have way more traffic than
we do that runs successfully on App
Engine okay actually so I had the same
thought you know we decided to use App
Engine because you know I thought it'd
be easy to get up and get up and online
for students so they would have to do
system in things but you know I've
always done my own thing as well not
used App Engine so I was highly
skeptical and I've had a similar similar
change of heart so what are some of the
things that App Engine does that that
make it so nice to work in that you
would otherwise have to do on your own
the big one it always boils down to they
provide a lot of infrastructure caching
highly replicated data stores they force
you to address what consistency means in
your application you know and does you
know the saint does a name have to be
updated everywhere immediately or can be
can things be a little bit slower to
update you know things like that that
building a simple app you just you know
you don't have to think and then
obviously you get really big and then
you have to scramble to try and redefine
you know how those sorts of things are
going to work in your system the
queueing is actually really powerful
there's really smooth it seems very
reliable and you know allows you to
build you know tasks and really focus on
the tasks as opposed to the
infrastructure to get the tasks
delivered the logging infrastructure by
and large works actually really well
mate
works really well considering the scale
of logging statements you can put
through it you mentioned the queueing
which is funny because we actually just
spend a lot of time in the previous
interview with Neil from Reddit talking
about all the infrastructure reddit has
built around the queues and the pre
computing cash and and that sort of
stuff was actually really tough for us
to build and there's a lot of things
that I think were really tough for us to
build I wonder if you can mention talk a
little bit about how the the version
handling works in App Engine and how
that kind of fits into the bigger
picture versions are actually really
interesting in App Engine they they're
different than what I expected
and so they'll actually allow you to
upload a totally different codebase
really but going against the same data
store and the same services and you can
use that I guess in a couple of
different ways effectively one thing is
that it enables what we call a be
testing so kind of like two versions of
a site or running at the same time and
there's actually an a/b testing some
administration there that allows you to
kind of blend you know percentage of
users in a somewhat sticky manner so
that you know you can roll out new
features to some users and test them and
and as they're more successful migrate
all the users to the new features things
like that the other thing is that they
kind of provide you a way to have I
think of it as like aspects into a
system you can actually you know you
could have a version of an app that is
for mainly administrative tasks or for
purely testing or for monitoring or and
then what you know your normal users
would see them in the site and they're
all running simultaneously and you know
against the same you know
soren services but it allows you to kind
of you know partition your logic and so
you could so reuse models and things
between them and it so it's really it
was a surprising feature that in there
and it seems to be really handy cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
