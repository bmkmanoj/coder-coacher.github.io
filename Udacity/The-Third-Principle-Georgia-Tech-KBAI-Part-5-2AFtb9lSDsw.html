air agents in CS 76 37 is that reasoning
is typically top down as well as bottom
up ordinarily we assume that data is
coming from the world and most of the
reasoning is bottom-up as we interpret
the data in contrast and knowledge-based
AI low-level processing the data results
in the invocation of knowledge
structures from memory these knowledge
structures then generate expectations
and the reasoning becomes top-down
frames were an example of this kind of
top-down reasoning we had input Angela
ate lasagna with her dad last night at
Olive Garden and the processing of this
input led it to the invocation of this
particular frame once this frame has
been pulled out of memory then this
particular frame can generate a lot of
expectations for example was the object
alive when Angela aided thoughts where
is the object now inside subject what is
the subjects mood after she had dinner
she was happy a similar kind of top-down
generation of expectations occurred when
we use frames to understand simple
sentences about earthquakes script for
another example of this kind of top-down
generation or expectations and
expectation based processing once we
have a script then the script generates
expectations over the next action it
tells us what to look for in the world
even before that happens and when that
doesn't happen we know an expectation
has been violated and we are surprised a
constraint propagation is another way of
thinking about top-down processing your
input data in the form of pixels
representing this cube we have to infer
that this image in fact is that of a
cube we have knowledge about this
constraints of various kind of junctions
that can occur in the world of cubes and
this knowledge and generates
expectations what might be a blade and
what might be a fold this notion of
top-down processing using knowledge
structures to generate expectations of
the world in order to be able to
interpret data is central to
knowledge-based AI it's also deeply
connected with human cognition some
current theories of human cognition
think of brains as predictive machines
we are constantly generating
expectations we are constantly making
predictions over the world that guide
our reasoning that guide our actions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
