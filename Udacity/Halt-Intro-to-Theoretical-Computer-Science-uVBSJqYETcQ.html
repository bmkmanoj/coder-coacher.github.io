easy to check if the program stops on a
given input or does not stop what if we
had an algorithm that could solve the
halting problem for any computer program
and any input that would actually be
immensely useful for example and
software testing or in debugging you
would just write your code and then ask
the algorithm does this code go into an
infinite loop at some time and the
algorithm will tell you if everything is
okay so of course there might be other
errors but at least you've eliminated
one very annoying way for a program to
crash so let's assume we had such an
algorithm so we had an algorithm and
that algorithm or function is called
halt and halt is called with two
arguments one is a program the other is
the input and of course this here is a
string and this one over here is a
string as well and our specification
will be hauled solves the halting
problem notice that we do not say how
long halt has time for this so halt can
be an amazingly amazingly complicated
algorithm it basically has unlimited
resources this algorithm can solve NP
complete problems it can solve worse
problems we don't really care the only
thing that we care about is that halt
solves the halting problem in some
finite amount of time so even in a
thousand years 2000 years we don't care
as long as halt is guaranteed to solve
this problem for any program and for any
input then we're satisfied no further
requirements other than that after a
certain amount of time the algorithm
either says yes this problem stops on
the input or no and now comes the
amazing part I can prove to you that
this algorithm cannot exist there is no
algorithm no matter how clever how
sophisticated that can solve the halting
problem the halting problem in other
words is known as a problem that is
undecidable by which we mean that no
computer program or algorithm can
reliably decide the halting problem for
all possible combinations of programs
and inputs so how do we show that you
might remember from our proof of
np-completeness that considering all
possible algorithms for a problem can
sometimes lead to very very messy
mathematical proofs in this case however
the proof
actually not that difficult so we're
going to go through it together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
