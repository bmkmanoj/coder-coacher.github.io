technical controls whether it has to do
with authentication or we in the context
of network security we talked with
firewalls and intrusion detection and so
on and these are used to secure systems
that we have in an organization what are
the assets that need to be secured who
do they need to be secured from so let's
talk a little bit more about this
organizational context we said there is
something of value that is under threat
so we need to worry about securing it
but what other reasons may be there for
us to worry about this problem well
there may be legal and compliance
reasons financial data health data for
example HIPAA mandates you know how you
can share online health data or digital
health data and things like that one
solution that we've been talking about
is that of course their various kind of
technical controls for me to use these
technical controls I have to understand
what kind of risk that I'm facing what
is the thread source what is the threat
landscape for me of course the technical
solution or control that I have is going
to have an associated costs I have to
worry about what that cost is and what
is the benefit of actually deploying
this particular solution that we are
talking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
