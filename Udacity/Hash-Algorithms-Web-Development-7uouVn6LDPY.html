and of course you can write your own but
you should never write your own the
first lesson you'll learn in and CS 387
is don't write your own at least for our
purposes of course if you're building a
hash table you know you can you can do
whatever you want but if you're gonna
use it for security purposes don't write
your own then you know if you want to
learn how to make a hash table knock
yourself out
of course somebody's probably already
done it better but hey you never know so
anyway some popular algorithms are crc32
which is basically designed for for
checksums if you were to send somebody a
bunch of data you know like a big file
you know you might also include a CRC of
that file and that you know it's
basically just a simple way to verify
that you've got the entire file and it's
not corrupted because you know you can
send a see it you can send a hash easier
than you can send a whole file you know
you can copy and paste the hash it's
just a few bits you can verify that the
file they you received has the same CRC
as the file they sent and then you don't
have to you know verify bit for bit that
you have the correct file so CRC is
really fast it's really it's really only
purpose is for doing checksums
basically creating a hash of a large
file it's security properties are not
very good it's very easy to find what we
call a collision which is when you know
when two things hash to the same value
which is you know the whole point of a
hash is that we can get a different
value for almost anything that we're
going to hash now obviously if if the
size of the input is substantially
greater than the size of the output yes
there are going to be collisions the
whole point is that it's hard to find
them and with crc32 it's very easy to
find them the reason you do CRC is
because you don't care about collisions
you just care about speed and CRC is
very fast the most popular hashing
algorithm out there is still md5 which
used to be used because it was both fast
you know ish not as fast as crc32 but
pretty fast and people you know thought
it was pretty secure except it's not
md5 has been broken repeatedly over the
last few years and it's very easy to
find md5 collisions you know given you
know an X that hashes into
why it's very easy given this why to
find another X that hashes into it which
is as you'll see a big problem so we
won't be using md5 for much at all in
this class well it has its use cases
right if you have a limited input it's
hard to find a collision there's certain
a class of attacks you know I'm making X
longer longer and longer and longer
that's a really easy way to find a
collision in md5 but if you limit the
length of X then you don't have to worry
too much about that vulnerability so
anyway just keep that in mind when you
really care about the data
don't use md5 the second most popular
hash it's called sha-1 this is not as
fast but it's fairly secure just now are
we starting to kind of hear you know
demonstrations of people finding uh
collisions in sha-1 it's still pretty
good
it's it's actually the second most
widely used hash behind md5 but for
things going forward you should really
use something like for example sha-256
which is as you might guess just kind of
a bigger version of sha-1 it's actually
not the algorithm I believe has changed
as well so we'll say this one is secure
ish and this one is pretty good it's
going to take off it's gonna take some
time now of course the trade-off is
speed you know so the better your
hashing algorithm right now the slower
it is so these are kind of these are
basically organized in cost and in
security so no big surprise there that
there's a kind of an inverse correlation
between cost and security but that's the
name of the game so depending on what
problem you're working on you may need
to actually make a decision but for our
purposes we're not gonna get a whole lot
of traffic well probably you saw 256 for
most things so let me show you how you
would use these</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
