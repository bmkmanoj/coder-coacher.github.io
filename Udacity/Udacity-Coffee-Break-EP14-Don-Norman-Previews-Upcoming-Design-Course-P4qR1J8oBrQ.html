happy friday guys happy coffee break i'm
chelsea Glasson I'm lead user researcher
at Udacity and I'm also taking on a new
role as course developer for a brand new
course at Udacity design of everyday
things and I'm so excited I have Don
Norman here with me he will be teaching
the class why don't you tell us a little
bit about it done hi it's really fun to
be here at Udacity teaching did you sign
of everyday things because you know
everything is designed and that's what
we're going to be talking about so take
a look at this coffee cup nothing
special about it but see the handle it's
it affords insertion of the hands of
Ford's lifting that's a design principle
and afford them to something you're
going to hear a lot about in this course
up but the same principles run for
software so designing this phone and all
the applications inside you and the
operating system so you can actually
find the stuff you need and use it same
principle supply or take a look at this
chair you know these chairs are
adjustable you can adjust the height and
the tension and all sorts of things and
almost nobody does that's because the
controls are in there you can't see them
when your seat it down even when you see
them you can't understand them not very
well behind this door it's actually one
of my favorite doors you see that black
flat plate it has the affordance of
pushing because you can't pull it or
twist it you can only push it and it's a
good signal we call it a signifier of
what you should do so I just push it but
nothing happens it's a false affordance
and a false signal is actually a bad
design this is the side of the door that
opens we actually use this very door as
an example in our course of good signals
and bad signals misleading signals and
we show what designer could have done to
make this less misleading this is what
is really excellent design it's a
complex device more complex and most of
you might use but it's really well
designed for the video
photographer who has to be able to
adjust the zoom lens aperture and other
aspects of the filming without
distracting from making the film itself
so this is an extreme case of great
mechanical and software design so we're
already busy at work on the course and I
just want to add at Udacity it's really
important for us to offer courses that
will set our students up for success and
their careers and whether you're
consciously aware of it or not you make
design decisions for working even
outside of work on a regular basis and
in this class we're going to teach you
the fundamental principles of design so
that you can become a successful design
dewart and thinker whether or not you
have the word design in your title well
said cheers done cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
