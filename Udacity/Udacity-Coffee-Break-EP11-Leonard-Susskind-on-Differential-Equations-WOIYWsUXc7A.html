Friday and welcome to coffee break my
name is Miriam and I'm a course
developer and course manager here at
Udacity well though recently I've been
working on college algebra when I first
started at Udacity it was working mostly
on different contributions in action now
the professor for differential equations
in action yonas ova scott is so
passionate about the course material
that he continues to add a new content
to the class the latest new thing that
we have for differential equations in
action is a really cool interview with
world-renowned theoretical physicist
Leonard Susskind now Leonard is widely
known as one of the fathers of string
theory and he's also done a lot of work
on quantum field theory and cosmology in
the interview he talks about the
relationship between mathematics and
physics why physicists continue to build
bigger and bigger machines and what his
favorite partial differential equation
is tune in to check it all out so first
site current physics seems to be
concerned with sophisticated mathematics
like Ramani and manifold self adjoint
operators path integrals over anti
commuting spaces but wouldn't it be fair
to say that most of this higher
mathematics in the end both down to
different equations
even if we're dealing with elementary
particles or with the entire universe it
almost always has to do with
differential equations yeah let me take
back one phrase almost it always has to
do with differential equations yes it
may be that other things other
mathematical things are more important
than the differential equations in this
particular area or that particular area
but it always has to do with
differential equations yes why is that
why isn't that differential equations
become there because what we're
interested in is how things vary you
know what physics is about is prediction
to basically to predict the future from
the present or the future from the past
and that means understanding how things
change and you not only want to
understand have a change with time but
you want to understand how they change
with space so the first thing you have
to input is the conditions at a instant
of time now you want to know how to
change how do they change they change
little by little incremental changes
from instant to instant and the
incremental changes at one position
depends on what's going on in the region
nearby that one position whenever you
have that situation where the change in
something depends on what's going on
nearby that's a partial differential
equation that's a partial so whenever
you're in the business of predicting how
the world changes or how some part of
the world changes both with respect to
position and with respect to time you're
in the business of partial differential
equations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
