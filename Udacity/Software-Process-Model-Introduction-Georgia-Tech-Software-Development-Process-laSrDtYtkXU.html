activities the possible phases performed
during the software development process
but there is something that we still
haven't discussed which is very
important and that is how should we put
these activities together to develop
software and this all comes down to the
concept of software process model also
called
software lifecycle model and what this
is is a prescriptive model of what will
happen from the very beginning to the
very end of a software development
process the main function of a lifecycle
model is to determine the order of the
different activities so that we know
which activities should come first and
which ones should follow another
important function of the lifecycle
model is to determine the transition
criteria between activities so when we
can go from one phase to the subsequent
one in other words what the model should
describe is what shall we do next and
how long should we continue to do it for
each activity in the model now let's see
a few traditional software process
models I will discuss them here at the
high level and then revisit some of
these models in the different mini
courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
