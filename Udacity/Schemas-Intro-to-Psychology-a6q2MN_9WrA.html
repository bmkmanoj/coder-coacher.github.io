information is through schemas we can
define schemas as a mental framework
that develops from our experiences with
particular people objects or events that
is you can think of schemas is framework
for representing some aspects of the
world
that tells us how people objects or
events are most likely to look like or
act like schemas influence our attention
and the absorption of new knowledge in
fact we're more likely to notice things
that fit into our schema once we have a
schema formed so they help us to
understand and organize experiences they
can also aid in our memory and recall
however it's important to note that
schemas have a tendency to remain
unchanged even if we're presented with
new information that contradicts our
schema let's say you have a schema of a
college professor that is you have a
conceptual idea of what a professor
looks like perhaps if there are a man or
a woman how old they are how tall they
are or how they dress so it may be that
someone's schema for a professor is that
they're old they were sports jackets
with patches in the elbows they have
glasses they carry a briefcase they're
male and other identifying features of a
professor so if that's a person schema
for a professor research shows that if
he or she is presented with new
information that is contradictory of
that schema for example it being a young
woman who dresses rather casually
carrying a backpack rather than a
briefcase and so on the person with the
developed schema would be less likely to
remember the female professor so schemas
can aid in our ability to remember but
they also biased our memory and our
perception</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
