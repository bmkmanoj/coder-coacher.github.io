the power of n times n squared and the
reason why is this correct is as follows
so the first one line here the first
line here takes constant amount of time
so that's not going to be relevant now
this loop here lines to 25 are executed
2 to the power of n times so the
question is each time this inner loop
here lines three to five is executed how
much time does that take so checking of
an assignment is valid takes o of N
squared times then if the assignment is
valid we need an additional o FN + 0 of
1 so an additional oh of end time
because this year is constant so we can
ignore it so the maximum time that lines
three to five take is o of N squared
plus o of n plus 0 of 1 so the largest
growing term here is 0 of n squared so
the inner loop takes o of N squared time
and that is executed 2 to the power of n
times so that's why the running time of
Alice's algorithm is 0 of 2 to the power
of n times n squared and the good thing
is that because we have 0 notation we
could do this analysis without actually
concretely stating how all of this
algorithm is programmed so as I hope you
see it's quite a useful notation to have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
