point we can use a translation matrix
this matrix has the translation movement
put in the top three positions of the
last column the rest of the matrix looks
the same as the identity matrix if you
multiply a point by this matrix the one
coordinate in the last position of the
vector multiplies each translation value
in turn this has the effect of taking
the original point and adding the
translation to it this may seem like a
convoluted way to add a vector to a
point but you'll soon see that many
other transforms can be combined and
stored in this matrix translations among
them with a single matrix multiply you
can then perform any number of
transformations say instead you multiply
a vector by this matrix you'll get the
same vector back the fourth coordinate
of the vector is 0 so for all the
translation values they're multiplied by
0 and so ignored this makes sense a
vector does not have a location and so
cannot be translated one thing worth
mentioning at this point is that this
type of matrix in vector notation is
called column-major form there is also a
row major form for notation where the
coordinates are written out in a row the
vector Row is multiplied by each column
of the matrix in turn personally this is
how I learn matrices 30 years ago
microsoft's directx uses this form the
story I heard as two wide row vectors
became popular was due to the influence
of Steve Koons
he wrote some influential papers on
transformations for computer graphics
back in the 1960s he said he used row
vectors in those papers because it was
easier for the stenographers to type the
translation values along the bottom of
the matrix rather than having to type
them in the cowl
all that said WebGL uses column major
notation and this convention is also the
norm in most publications so that's what
we'll use here either form is fine
they're both just a way of writing down
the math I mostly want you to be aware
that there's another form out there
called row major the good news is that
internally WebGL and DirectX ultimately
store the translation values in the same
locations in memory if you go look at
any matrix in memory you'll see that the
last four values are the three
translation values and then one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
