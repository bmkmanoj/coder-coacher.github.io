narrate my thoughts so you can pause my
answer at any time and go back and try
again if you got stuck somewhere first I
thought about when I want to draw the
line and want to draw it when I add a
friend so I'm gonna need to update the
addfriend method first I want to draw a
circle for the beginning of the line so
I'll make a small circle and draw it at
the top-left corner of the picture but
in the addfriend method I don't have
access to that right now I lost track of
the X&amp;amp;Y coordinates when the constructor
ended I never saved the top-left corner
before maybe this is something the
person used to remember about itself
I'll create instance variables for X&amp;amp;Y
there they are but I haven't initialized
them where do I initialize them I
initialize them in the constructor X
starts out as X chord and Y starts out
as Y chord now I can draw my circle
it'll just be a new small circle with
X&amp;amp;Y and I'll fill it now I want to draw
the line it will start at my upper left
coordinate but where does it end
it ends at the friend I'm adding if I
want to access their instance variables
for X&amp;amp;Y I need to use friend X and
friend dot Y so my line will look like
this line line is a new line starts at
my XY coordinates and goes to my friends
XY coordinates last I need to actually
draw the line and let's see if I did
this right looks like it compiled and if
I run person demo 2 it prints out the
picture we wanted good work on that quiz
that was really good practice the next
time you see something like this it'll
feel a lot easier than it did this time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
