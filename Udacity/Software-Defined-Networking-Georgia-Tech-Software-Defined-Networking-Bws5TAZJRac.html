Software Defined Networking or Sdn well
first start by defining Sdn in
particular we'll talk about what is a
software-defined Network then we'll talk
about what are the advantages of Sdn
over a conventional network architecture
we'll overview the history of Sdn the
infrastructure that supports it in
particular how Sdn czar designed and
built and the applications of Sdn
specifically what they can be used for
and how they can be used to simplify
various network management tasks perhaps
the best way to understand what an Sdn
is is to compare it to the behavior of
today's networks today's networks have
two functions the first is the data
plane whose task it is to forward
packets to their ultimate destination
but in order for the data plane to work
we also need a way of computing the
state that each of these routers has
that allows the routers to make the
right decision in forwarding traffic to
the destination the state that lives in
each of these routers that allows the
routers to make these decisions about
how to forward packets are called
routing tables it's the job of the
network's control plane to compute these
routing tables in conventional networks
the control and data plane both run on
the routers that are distributed across
the network in an Sdn the control plane
runs in a logically centralized
controller
additionally the controller typically
controls multiple routers across the
network and often the control program
exerts control over all of the routers
in the network thus facilitating Network
wide control these two characteristics
are the defining features of a
software-defined network the separation
of data and control allows the network
operator to build a network with
commodity devices where the control
resides in a separate control program
this refactoring allows us to move from
a network where devices are vertically
integrated making it very tough to
innovate to a network where the devices
have open interfaces that can be
controlled by software thus allowing for
much more rapid innovation let's survey
a brief history of Sdn previous to 2004
configuration was distributed leading to
buggy and unpredictable behavior around
2004 we had the idea to control the
network from a logically centralized
high-level program that logically
centralized controller focused on the
border gateway protocol and was called
the routing control platform or RCP in
2005 researchers generalized the notion
of the RCP for different planes the
decision plane which computed the
foreign state for devices in the network
the data plane which forwarded traffic
based on decisions made by the decision
plane and the dissemination and
discovery planes which provide the
decision playing the information that it
needs to compute the foreign state which
ultimately gets pushed to the data plane
around 2008 these concepts effectively
hit the mainstream through a protocol
called open flow open flows intellectual
roots are with the RCP and 4d but open
flow is made practical when merchants
silicon vendors opened their api's so
that switch chipsets could be controlled
from software so suddenly there was an
emergence of cheap switches that were
built based on open chipsets that could
be controlled from software this
development effectively allowed us to
decouple the control plane and the data
plane in commodity switching hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
