comes to the CF AAA or the DMCA the laws
that we just talked about related to
fraud abuse and protection of digital
objects first of all enforcement is
actually quite challenging it's
difficult for a number of reasons first
of all attribution is hard how exactly
do you know that this is the person
who's responsible for something
fraudulent that was done we know that
you know a request or data may have
flowed to a certain computer but there
may be malware sitting on that computer
it may not be any fault of the person
who owns that computer it could be some
bot that's under the control of somebody
else who's actually doing that so how
exactly do you attribute a certain
illegal activity action to a person and
what makes this really even harder is
the fact that the Internet has is has no
national boundaries so that the
International nature with the trash
national nature of the internet of
course is presents not a set of
challenge finally I think we had a quiz
question talking about you know have the
various laws related to computer fraud
than any good have the reduced cyber
crime or hell cybercrime going up well
one of the challenge is that we you know
making laws is a slow process and cyber
criminals can basically stay ahead of it
the criminal ecosystem can keep evolving
they can work around the legal
safeguards we put in place so and that
can happen very rapidly much faster than
our ability to put laws in place and
find ways to enforce them get people in
front of judges and courts and things
like that so they've been cases we're
going to look at a few but obviously one
of the challenges how do you stay
current with what is going on in the
cyber criminal world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
