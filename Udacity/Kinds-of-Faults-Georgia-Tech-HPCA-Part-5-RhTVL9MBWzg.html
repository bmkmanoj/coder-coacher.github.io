can we have we can classify the faults
by cause and we can have a hardware
fault when the hardware of the system
fails to perform as it was designed to
do we can have design faults for example
software bugs or design faults and also
some of the hardware design mistakes
such as the famous Pentium FD bug where
this F Dave instruction was not
implemented correctly so if you gave it
some combinations of numbers you would
get incorrect results and it was
designed that way then we have operation
faults for example operator and user
mistakes for example the operator
accidentally tells the system to shut
down and now of course it no longer
provides the service that it's supposed
to provide and then we can have
environmental folds such as fire that
burns down the system power failure
sabotage of the system all things that
in the environment may cause the system
to have an error or not perform the
service note that these are all faults
some of them don't result in a failure
for example the f debug doesn't result
in a error or a failure if you never
really use the wrong combination of
numbers for a software bug in a rarely
used function may never result in an
actual error operator faults may not
cause the system to actually have an
error for example if you shut down the
system but at this time for example
nobody's trying to use it to get service
from it it might not be an actual
failure and then we can have a fire but
we protected our system from fire a fire
in the system room may not actually
result in an error for example we can
have a switch over to another system
power failure can be mitigated so it can
be a fault but may not result in an
error for example if our battery power
supply lasts long enough to overcome the
power failure and so on so again these
are faults according to their cause any
of these folds might result in errors
and subsequently failures but for all of
them it is positive
that we get the fault but not an error
or a failure we can also classify faults
by duration for how long do we have the
fault condition for example we can have
a permanent fault once we have it it
doesn't get corrected an example of a
permanent fault is when we want to see
what's inside the processor and now the
processor is in four pieces and we don't
know how to put it back together we can
have intermittent faults they last for a
limited duration of time but they are
recurring so it's not like we get this
type of vault and for a while it causes
things to not work fine but then it just
disappears and never comes back this is
something like every couple of seconds
something happens a good example of
intermittent fault is when we overclock
our system it works fine that crashes
then we reboot it it works fine it
crashes and so on so for a while it
works fine but then the same type of
problem recurs and then finally we have
the transient faults which are when it
lasts for a while then just goes away a
transient fault is for example when an
alpha particle hits the chip so for a
while it has all sorts of problems but
then once we reboot it it's no longer
going to have these problems and they're
not going to occur again until you know
much later when something else happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
