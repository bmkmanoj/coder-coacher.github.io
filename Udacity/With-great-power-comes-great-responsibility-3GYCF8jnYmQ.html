responsibility invoking a method that
doesn't exist is not usually a good idea
let me show you what I mean here's an
array similar to the last one but this
time I've swapped out the dealer object
for a string now let's see what happens
when we call the method play no compiler
errors so far so good and we press run
uh-oh of course we knew that was going
to happen because NS string obviously
has no method called play let's take a
look at what this error says so we'll
scroll up to the top of the console and
it says unrecognized selector sent to
instance and then there's a string of
numbers you've probably seen an error
like this before but you may not have
realized that that word selector comes
from objective-c in objective-c selector
is another name for method so when you
see this unrecognized selector sent to
instance start debugging by
investigating objects with the type ID
it's possible that the class of the
offending object is not what you think
it is at runtime and to defend your code
against the perils of ID you can also
use introspection you can ask if the
object at hand response to the selector
in question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
