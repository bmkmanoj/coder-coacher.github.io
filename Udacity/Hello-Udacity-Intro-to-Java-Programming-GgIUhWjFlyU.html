follow along what I'm doing here select
the project option open the project
navigate to the folder into which you
have unzipped the starter code go to
lesson 1 and then - hello and here you
get an icon that represents our first
program double click on it and the
window pops up with the program code
here again is the line that I said it's
the most important one we'll have a
closer look at the bits and pieces of
the statement later but right now let me
show you how to execute a program click
on the button that says compile now your
program is translated from the Java
language into a lower-level language
that the computer can execute
efficiently we don't normally have to
worry about that process except we have
to remember to hit the compile button
before running the program now back in
the main display right click on this box
select the second line that contains the
word main and that launches the main
part of our program you get a dialog
here where you should simply click OK as
soon as you do that another window pops
up and voila here's our greeting hello
world now of course I want you to change
the greeting and print something else
and I want you to show me what you did
you will use the Udacity coding
environment and not bluej to give us any
of the code that you have developed let
me show you that whenever we want you to
submit programming work you will see a
screen such as the following here we
give you a bit of starter code and some
instructions on what we want you to do
right now it says please print hello
Udacity you can type your answer in here
or even better you can first do the
answer in bluej and then just paste it
in here to test your program scroll down
and click the test run button and here
you see the program output once you're
happy click the submit button that way
we get your work and you get feedback in
this case that it was correct now it's
your turn to try it Sara will walk you
through a very first programming
assignment good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
