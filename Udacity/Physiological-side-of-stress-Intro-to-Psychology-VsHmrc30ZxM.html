material we talked about during the
lesson on the brain which was lesson 3
this material may feel pretty dense but
you can always refer to the document
we're giving you on the physiological
side of the stress response stressful
events can cause changes in our
physiology most importantly we see that
the autonomic nervous system endocrine
system in the brain all interact
together to produce changes in our body
systems as a result of stress remember
that the autonomic nervous system has
both the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems sympathetic is
responsible for arousing and
parasympathetic is responsible for
calming remember for example when Susan
encountered the bear in Yosemite this
resulted in activation of her
sympathetic nervous system which allowed
for an increase in heart rate which
pumped more blood to the large muscle
groups and more oxygen was available so
her muscles can function and react to
the dangerous situation she found
herself in in addition to the autonomic
nervous system the endocrine system is
important in our stress response because
it consists of the major hormone
releasing glands that are active during
our stress response
that's the pituitary gland and the
adrenal glands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
