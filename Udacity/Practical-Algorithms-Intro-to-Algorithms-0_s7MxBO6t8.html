analysis and doing that in conjunction
with the development of algorithms leads
to better more practical systems yes of
course they possess nowadays I'm what
they barely eat and so you cannot just
rely on having to get spit up you really
need something which works well is
nothing thousand thirty cents so it's in
consciousness very very relevant now
when that hand is a deep gap between
theory and practice often and you really
have to fill this gap and most
developers it's hard for developers they
don't have the 10th round and also they
don't have the time to read too late the
stapler answer within the time they have
to develop a product to implement the
algorithm so I think it's very important
to come up with cherry creek without
rhythm and investigated verticality and
described their practical variants and
do you see that happening by people
working in teams or do you think people
like each individual has to be expert in
both the engineering side and also the
analysis knowing that done in teams
because there are some individuals who
are good at force but in general that
people who are Deseret and engine UMass
and they're people who are deaf director
of engineering new algorithm so it can
be done in teams or so the process or
consecutive publication someone
publishes their charity colleague udah
beres that there's someone else Jessica
debilitation of it for me algorithms
have several components there is a
mathematical component of operations
which is formal analysis of averages
wave pool Devo bonus and then there is
an engineering aspect where you try to
implement the fact that other if you can
on the real problem and I'd like to take
their poets which is data thank you tiff
network which combines the two
approaches so you sort of your real
world
model and the end to try to design
another important tool some things about
this and then implemented object and see
if it performs as beauty to you and it's
not you try to modify the curie and i
just ethics clay behavior this algorithm
war in them to get robbery how do you
even measure the asymptotic running time
and practice do you run a bigger bigger
random example that sort of thing oh you
don't a synthetic data yeah if you have
a certain generator which later set
parameters and weakened natural health
out written tops on real-world data is
much harder yeah right because it
doesn't necessarily scale in an escalade
land also poor old networks for example
errand is still natural examples maybe
