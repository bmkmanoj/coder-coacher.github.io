instruction really specifies several
operations each of which operations
would have taken a normal instruction in
a normal superscalar processor the
instruction set for a VL iw processor
typically has all the normal is a
opcodes so each of the villi double
instructions can typically do whatever
normal instructions would have been able
to do in and out of order processor a
typical valid able processor will also
have support for full predication or at
least very extensive predication support
this is because it relies on the
compiler to expose parallelism one of
the ways the compiler does that is
through scheduling instructions so we
really want a compiler to be able to
predicate and thus expose more
opportunities for instruction scheduling
avail iwi say also typical includes a
lot of architectural registers the
reason for this is that a lot of the
scheduling optimizations require use of
additional registers we have already
seen some examples of this in the
compiler support for ILP lesson where we
have seen that sometimes we have to put
some things in other registers when we
are rearranging instructions so to help
the compiler do instruction scheduling
we need more registers than usual and we
really really want the compiler to do a
good job here so we will provide a lot
of registers to it another frequently
seen type of I say support for compiler
work are the branch hints where the
compiler can specify to the hardware
what it thinks the branches will do this
helps the branch breakers and we also
often see some sort of compaction
mechanism for V liw instructions for
example if we have a for operation
instruction and we have something like
this we do some operation and then the
next operation needs to be here and thus
we have to put no ops in here the actual
viola double instruction might include
some sort of a stop bit for every
instruction in which case we can put up
one here then mark this as a stop and
then we can put up to an OP tree like
this mark this as a stop and even
squeeze in maybe something else here so
the idea is that
instead of having a lot of no-ops in our
instruction now the processor fetches
this instruction checks for the stop
bits and in the first cycle does this in
the second cycle does up to the next
stop and so on so this helps a lot in
reducing the number of knobs and does
the code bloat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
