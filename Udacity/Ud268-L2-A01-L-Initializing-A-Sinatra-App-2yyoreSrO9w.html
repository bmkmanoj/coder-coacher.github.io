let's take a step back and talk about
creating our own brand news not your
apps from scratch it may sound daunting
but fortunately starting a new Sinatra
app is actually extremely simple the
first step is to make sure you have the
Sinatra gem installed so if you're not
sure just run gem install Sinatra it
might take a little bit to finish
installing Sinatra but once you have the
gem installed all we need to do next is
create a new ruby file that will write
our application code inside of so i'm
going to call mine app dot RB you can
call yours whatever you'd like as long
as it's a valid ruby name next up we
need to open up our new apt RB ruby file
using your favorite text editor i'll use
sublime text inside the apt RB file all
we need to do is require the Sinatra gem
require Sinatra and don't forget to save
your file and that's it that's actually
our complete snatcher app it doesn't do
much but it's a valid snot your app
that's ready for us to start running now
we can start up the Sinatra server just
like we did earlier in the last lesson
by switching back to our terminal in
running the ruby file back in the
terminal will execute aptet RB ruby app
dot RB and you should see some server
output telling you that your app is now
running so let's give it a shot and test
it out so we now need to change over to
our browser and visit localhost 4 5 6 7
as it specifies here so when we visit
localhost four five six seven we see
this nice default Sinatra error message
Sinatra doesn't know this ditty this
natural source contains code that will
automatically serve up this error page
until you define your own content for
the home page so while it may not be the
most useful or exciting application we
do have a working web app even though
all it does is give us a Sinatra error
message so now that
we've successfully initialized a new
Sinatra app let's talk about what goes
in this virtually empty file and what
kind of code do we write to make that
error message go away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
