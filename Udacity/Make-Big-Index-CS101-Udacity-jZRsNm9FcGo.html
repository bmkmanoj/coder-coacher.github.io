the time of execution of toy programs of
a loop that does nothing what we care
about though is the time of execution of
our indexing code so what I'm going to
do next is write a program to be able to
test the time of execution of the next
encode to get a good test we need to
make a big MX we need to fill up an
index with lots and lots of words and we
could do that by hand that would take a
lot of time and effort so what I'm going
to do instead is to find a procedure
that makes a big index so what it does
is take in a size and then it's going to
fill up in index with that number of
words to fill up the index with that
number of keywords we need to generate
different words so what I've done is
created a variable called letters that
initially is all A's and as we go
through the loop we go through the loop
size number of times we keep making a
new string we add that string to the
next I'll explain what makes string does
later we add that string to the index
then we change the letters and we're
going to keep increasing the letter once
we get to Z we wrap around for now it's
not too important to understand
everything in this code but i do want to
walk through the code a little bit so
what this loop is doing is going through
all of the positions in the letters
array and we filled this up with eight
different elements and we're going to go
through those elements starting from the
last one going backwards so this range
loop goes from the length minus 120
stepping by negative 1 we're going to
check each letter if the letter is less
than Z that means we can increase it and
we're going to increase it using this
code here and I'll talk soon about the
code that turns letters into numbers but
what this expression does is get the
next letter so if the letter wasn't a
the result after this will be a B and
we're going to replace the letter at
that position in the letters list with
the next letter if the letter is a Z we
don't wanna go beyond the alphabet so
instead we're going to set that letter
to a and we're going to go back through
the loop to find the next layer once we
found one less than Z we break we only
need to change one letter what the mixed
ring procedure does that we call here is
just turn that array into one string so
it's going through the elements of P
which is this list of letters that keeps
changing and concatenating all
those letters into one string so the
whole point of this is to allow us to
easily make big indexes so we can run
tests on different sized indexes so
let's try this in the Python shell first
I'll show you what the result is when we
use make big index we'll start with a
fairly small one so I'm passing in three
is the size what make big index gives us
is an index with three keywords a it'd
be a C and for each of them there's one
URL which is the name fake if we pass in
a bigger value this will have an index
with 100 keywords so we're going to pass
in 100 as the size we get this big index
and you can see it's starting to change
the second from the last letter to make
sure each let each word is a different
more than index so what we want to do
now is look at how the time of
executions take four different sized
indexes so let's make a really big index
so oregano will make an index of size
ten thousand and remember our concern is
the time for lookups that's the
operation that's going to happen most
frequently so we're not timing the time
to make the begin decks let's see what
the time is to do a lookup and so I'll
time the execution of looking up in
index 10,000 the key word and the word
makes a difference so first let's try
looking up the word Udacity which sadly
is not in our index we'd need them a
much bigger index to get up to Udacity
and the time of execution is shown here
so it's point zero zero zero eight
seconds so still getting close to a
millisecond but still quite fast let's
make a bigger index this time we have a
hundred thousand keywords it's going to
take a little longer to make it but
we're not worrying about the time to
make it now what we care is the time to
do a lookup
so that took a long time let's see how
many entries there are so we can look at
the very last element in our index and
we can see we got to did which I don't
know how to pronounce another way to see
that which we didn't talk about yet we
can actually index from the back using
negative numbers so if you use negative
1 as the index that will give us the
last entry in the list so now we'll try
doing a timed execution we're going to
look up in the 10,000 size index and
we'll see the times pretty similar to
what it was before that time might vary
a little bit let's try it once more and
again it's just under a millisecond so
now we'll try instead of the 10,000
index looking up in the 100,000 length
index the same look up and we see that
the time is now 10 times that so it's
now about 8.6 milliseconds whereas
before it was point nine milliseconds
and let's for consistency try that again
well note that these timings vary a
little bit each time we do it and
there's lots of reasons why the time
varies we're running lots of other
things on the computer at the same time
so it's not the case that we have total
control over the processor and running
exactly the same thing every time
because all of the other programs might
be doing other things the other reason
the time can vary is where things are in
memory sometimes it's very quick to
lookup value in memory sometimes it
takes longer and we're not going to talk
about the details of that what matters
is that the time is roughly the same
each time we execute it and it really
depends on the size of the input in this
case it's the size of the input table so
when we increase the size of the table
to have a hundred thousand entries it's
about 10 times as slow as when we had
10,000 entries so now let's have a few
quizzes to see if you can guess how
these timings work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
