having iterated through the entire
dataset millions and millions of tags
okay then what I'm going to do is print
out the data that I found for my audit
okay so it actually takes a little while
for that to run so I've run it already
okay and here's what the output looks
like okay so there actually aren't
really that many unusual values what I
find is so in the United States and this
is going to vary from one country to
another in the United States we number
certain types of roads so this would be
a US Highway United States Highway the
same thing with 53:59 and so on alright
so that's why I'm seeing these as keys
alright now this is odd my guess is
these look like zip codes to me or
postal codes alright another Road number
okay and then I'm seeing different forms
of Avenue alright and as I move through
this okay so here's a good example of a
set for this particular key value here
for court okay so these are all of the
different uses of CT as an abbreviation
for court in this particular data set
okay and as I scroll through this I see
the rest of the unusual Street types
okay now what I have to decide and
basically this is the process that
you're going to follow through the next
few exercises is which of these are okay
and which of them do I need to do
something about South Avenue well that's
actually a correct way of representing a
street name there's nothing wrong with
that it's just that it wasn't expected
in my audit it's okay though I would
probably not want to do anything to
change how this is represented on the
other hand I don't really like all caps
abbreviations so I would probably
transform all of the abbreviations into
the specific word that that represents
so for example Pkwy is an abbreviation
for Parkway okay so that's what I would
probably use there alright and the same
with other abbreviations that we find
here Street Terrace and so on okay so
your general process for the exercises
that follow is going to be to write some
code to audit the data and then decide
what type of fixes you want to apply to
that data and then write the code that
actually performs the fix what you're
going to be doing is building up a code
base that will allow you to add data to
MongoDB in such a way that you're
cleaning it so with each step you're
going to have increasingly clean data so
one way of going about this would be to
do all of your auditing and all of your
cleaning up front and then put all of
the data into MongoDB okay
and that would be a perfectly reasonable
way to go about doing it you can also
take a more iterative approach to it and
clean one piece of data at a time or one
type of data at a time and then sort of
reload your data in MongoDB now the data
set that you'll have will be small
enough that will be possible okay it's
really up to you how you want to
approach this problem so again our basic
process here or as we called it in
lesson 3 our blueprint is going to be to
audit a particular type of data develop
a plan for cleaning write code to clean
and go again ok with the next type of
data that we want to then audit and
develop a plan and eventually code for
cleaning ok when you're all done you
will have gone through a process of
cleaning up various facets of the data
so that it's ready to be stored in our
database you'll also have gained quite a
bit of experience with parsing XML using
event based parsing good luck with the
next several exercises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
