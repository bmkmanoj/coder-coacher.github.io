exploring how to create our own watch
faces the best way to start is to look
at some of the existing samples and see
how they work so go to file import
sample and type in watch face you can
create this with all the default values
if you expand the wearable project
you'll see there are many services to
find here the sample actually includes
more than one watch face and we'll see
how they're defined shortly and what
they do so now you should build and
install the application side to the
phone and click the green play button
and then also build and install the
wearable side as well note that you
won't be able to select a default
activity because neither of these
contain one so let's run this and see
what it looks like now on the watch on
the watch we can select a watch face by
pressing and holding on the current
watch face you'll then see a selector
appear if you scroll to the right you'll
see sample analog select that you'll see
it shows the time with hands and taking
seconds now let's select sample sweep
this one is very similar to the sample
analog except you'll notice the second
hand has a smooth sweeping motion this
refresh is much faster than once per
second to achieve this smooth motion now
let's select sample card bounds this
one's not meant to be used as a watch
face but it's meant to be used to help
you visualize the dimensions of the peak
card now let's select sample tilt this
is implemented using OpenGL and shows
how you can apply arbitrary 3d rotations
to a watch face now let's select sample
calendar this is interesting because it
actually looks at the calendar on your
phone and determines how many meetings
you have coming up and presents that in
a watch face this is an example of how
you can implement awareness about your
users schedule as part of a watch face
let's go to sample digital you will
notice this one has a little gear icon
underneath this allows you to actually
configure the watch face locally from an
activity so let's select a red
background now interestingly we can also
go to the phone and start up the Android
wear companion app you'll see that
sample digital is selected here too and
there's also a little gear icon you can
click on that and there are more
configuration options available for the
watch you'll see how the red background
that we selected earlier shown here the
sample actually uses the data API to
synchronize the selections between the
phone and the wearable so you can make
changes on either side like adjusting
the text color here or the
ground here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
