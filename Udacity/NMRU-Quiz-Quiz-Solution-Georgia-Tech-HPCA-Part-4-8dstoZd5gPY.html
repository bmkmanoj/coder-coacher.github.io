most recently used replacement policy
quiz we have these accesses and now
let's see which ones might be hits and
which ones might be misses this one is
definitely miss because we have nothing
in the cache so now we have brought into
the cache this one is definitely hit
now we're gonna access B and this is
definitely a miss and we're gonna put B
in a separate place in the cache from
where we put a because a is the most
recently used block so we will put B in
one of the other three blocks and we
definitely will put B in a line that
doesn't contain a so we will not kick
out a because a is the most recently
used block we will choose one of the
other three lines to evict to put B
there
so so far if this is our cache we have a
and B there now we will access a and
have a hit so C is definitely a Miss and
at that point a is the most recently
used block and we will find one of these
three to evict to put C there in this
type of a situation it looks like B
might actually be evicted but remember
that we also had valid bits for all
these blocks so when we have a
replacement policy typically we will
first fill all the lines in the cache
set before we move on and start evicting
something so we will put C into one of
the empty slots and now that is the most
recently accessed line a is now a hit
and that is now the most recently
accessed line now when we access D it's
not in the cache so we will have a miss
we will again put thee in an unused
place and that will now be the most
recently used one then a gets accessed
and we have a hit and at this point a is
the most recently used block now we will
have a Miss on e because it's not in the
cache and now the question is what will
be evicted will definitely not evict a
so we know that the next four accesses
to a will be all hits II will be
replacing one of these three blocks
so if we replace C or D then here we
will have a hit if we however select B
for replacement and put either then B
here we'll have a miss
so we have a hit or a miss here in total
we have 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 misses so this is
the final answer to this quiz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
