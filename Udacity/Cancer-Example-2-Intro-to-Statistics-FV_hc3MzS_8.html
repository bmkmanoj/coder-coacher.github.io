whether a person suffers cancer but we
can run a test like a blood test in the
outcome of the blood test may be
positive or negative but like any good
test it tells me something about the
thing I really care about whether the
person is cancerous or not so let's say
if the person has the cancer the test
comes up positive with the probability
of 0.9 and that implies if the person
has cancer the negative outcome would
have a 0.1 probability and that's
because these two things have to add up
to one I've just given you a fairly
complicated notation that says the
outcome of the test depends on whether
the person has cancer or not that is
more complicated than everything else we
talked about so far we call this thing
over here a conditional probability and
the way to understand this is it was
very funny notation there's a bar in the
middle and the bar says what's the
probability of the stuff on the left
given that we assumed the stuff on the
right is actually the case now in
reality we don't know whether the person
is cancer or not and in a later unit
you're going a reason about whether the
person is cancer given a certain data
set but for now we assume we have
godlike capabilities you can tell with
absolute certainty that the person is
cancer and we can determine what the
outcome of the test is this is a test
that isn't exactly deterministic it
makes mistakes
but it only makes a mistake in 10
percent of the cases as illustrated by
the 0.1 down here now it turns out I
haven't fully specified the tests the
same test might also be applied to a
situation where the person does not have
cancer so this little thing over here is
my shortcut of not having cancer and now
let me say the probability of the test
giving me a positive results a false
positive result when there's no cancer
is 0.2 you cannot
me what server ability of a negative
outcome in case we know for a fact the
person doesn't have cancer so please
tell me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
