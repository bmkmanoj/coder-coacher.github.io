following procedure find last given a
haystack in a needle returns the index
of the last instance of needle in
haystack or negative one if it's not
present so for example if we're trying
to find the last Oh in philosophy we're
going to get this one zero one two three
four five six instead of this earlier 10
1 2 3 4 find the last occurrence some of
you may already be familiar with this
procedure you may have seen it in a
previous class doesn't matter i'm going
to write it for you I've written find
last for you but actually I've written a
version that has a bug this works pretty
much correctly what we're going to do is
work our way backwards but we're going
to use two variables one to store where
we currently are and one to remember the
last time we found something successful
so let's imagine we're looking in
haystack for a we're going to find this
a first great then we're going to go
over and find this a great and then
we're going to get negative 1 so we want
to return this a so we're going to find
the last one by repeatedly searching
forward until we get negative 1 and then
conceptually will back up one remember
we get negative 1 because the find
procedure and Python returns negative 1
if something isn't found so forever i'm
going to start finding the needle in the
haystack find this a great if that
didn't work i return otherwise i look
again until it doesn't work down here at
the bottom i have four possible inputs
find last a stack a find last haystack z
find last haystack empty string find
last empty string need only some of
these will actually show off the bug the
bug is that I'm returning this pause
instead of last boss what I'd like you
to do is check each box corresponding to
an input that shows the bug remember
what it means to show the bug on the
buggy code you get one answer but on the
correct code or in our minds you get
another</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
