showing the globe has plotted circles
and the map to show the relative
distortion at different latitudes as you
can see here as you go south and north
the distortion increases and it's a bit
subtle but the distortion going from
circle one to two is much less than
going from two to three so there's not
equal distortion going from the equator
north but it does its best as close to
the equator as it can to preserve area
and once you get far far north the
Mercator projection is much more lenient
in its distortions one thing of note is
that the Mercator projection actually
preserves area across a latitude line so
even if you are very north going across
the same latitude line all the circles
are equally as distorted if you've ever
wondered why Alaska looks about as big
as the entire United States and
Greenland looks bigger than Africa it's
simply because the Mercator projection
vastly distorts countries or areas so
far north and south of the equator and
there's often one of the most ubiquitous
map projections you see out there
regardless of this distortion effect but
for our purposes we are interested in
countries in the middle region one
because they're the participating
countries in the world cup' are most
frequently participating and to the
locations near the center of the map are
the ones where the World Cups actually
been held so let's return to our code
and start drawing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
