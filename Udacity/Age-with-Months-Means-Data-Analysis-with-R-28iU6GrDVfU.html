frame to the FC by age one this time
though we wanted to have fern counts by
age months instead of age years here's
one solution that you might have done by
chaining the operations of deep I are
together so first I want to make sure
that the library is loaded and then I'm
going to create my data frame PFF see by
age months so I'm going to take my
original data frame and apply a bunch of
functions to it from the deep I our
package first I'll group by age with
months then I'll chain on a new command
called summarize and here i want to
summarize by friend count mean and
friend count median and the number of
users in my group and finally I'll chain
on one more command that will arrange my
data frame by age with months running
this command I can see that I have my
new data frame notice too that I have a
lot more observations and that should
make sense because i went from age years
to age months and just to be sure I'll
print out a couple rows of my data frame
to examine it there's my age measured in
months my friend count mean my friend
count median and in the number of users
in each group now there was another way
to get the same data frame let's see how
we can do that instead of chaining the
commands together I can use the data
frame and then apply commands to it so
first I'll create age with month groups
i'll use that using the group by command
i'll pass it my data frame and then i
want to group by age with months that's
the variable now that I have my groups I
want to summarize them using mean friend
count median friend count and in which
is the number of users in each group so
here I'll summarize age with months and
i'll save it into this new variable now
that I have my groups I want to
summarize them using the summarized
command I'll create a new data frame
called PFC by age months to I want to
summarize this data frame since it's
already in groups so i'll pass it here
age with month groups now i just need to
add the variables that i want to
summarize I want the mean of friend
count so i'll save that to a variable I
want the median a friend count so also
save that to a variable and finally I
want the number of users in each age
group now I just want to take this data
frame and arrange it by age with months
so I'll pass this data frame into the
arrange function and then I'll tell it
to arrange by a
with months notice too that I'm saving
this new data frame into our old data
frame so I'm just writing it over
running all this code we can see that we
get our new data frame and we can also
check it just by using our head function
sure enough the same exact data frame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
