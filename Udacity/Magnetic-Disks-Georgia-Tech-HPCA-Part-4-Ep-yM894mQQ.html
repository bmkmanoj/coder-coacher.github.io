today usually means a hard disk or a
hard drive but the so called floppy
disks are also magnetic disks and work
very much along the same lines it's just
that today we mostly have hard drives
and few people even remember floppy
drives a magnetic disk has a spindle to
which we can attach so-called platters
all of the platters are attached to the
same spindle and rotate at the same
speed let's say in this direction there
is a motor here that really drives the
spindle to rotate and that causes all
the platters to rotate at the same speed
if we look at the single platter it has
a surface covered with magnetic material
on one side and also on another so this
graph that has three platters usually
will have a total of six surfaces the
data bits are on all the surfaces we
access this data by having a magnetic
head attached to an arm and another one
for the lower surface and then all of
these heads are attached to a head
assembly which can move all the heads in
unison so if this head is here this head
will be in the same position on another
platter and so on we don't individually
move the heads we move them all at the
same time so because the platter is
rotating and the head is staying in
place usually the head will be able to
access this circle on the surface of the
disk each head will be able to access
the circle on its own surface and all of
these are going to be at the same
distance from the spindle this is called
a track all of the tracks at the same
distance from the spindle form what is
called a cylinder the cylinder
simply consists of one track from each
surface where the tracks in the
cylinders are those that can be accessed
by different heads at the same time
so for example here there are six heads
when they stay in this position and all
the platters rotate they are able to
access the six tracks of that cylinder
the way we access different tracks on
the disc is by moving the head so that
it comes closer or gets further from the
spindle and that way we can access the
entire area of each surface so the data
naturally will be organized into bits
that are positioned along the track and
then another track will have different
bits and so on
if we look at the surface from above and
this is now the spindle this would be
one track and this would be another and
finally on one track we don't store data
continuously through the track because
usually a lot of bits are on a single
track instead the data along one track
is divided into sectors and a sector
will be the smallest unit that we can
actually read knife to disk rotates in
this direction and the head is currently
here as the disc rotates different bits
of the sector are going to be under the
head so the sector will have some
preamble here that is a recognizable bit
pattern that tells the head that this is
the beginning of a sector then we have
the appropriate number of the bits for
the sector that actually hold the data
followed usually by some checksum and
other information that is needed to
possibly correct errors in this sector
and then another sector will just have
the same things and so on so when the
head assembly moves to a particular
cylinder then the head start listening
for the beginning of the sector once
they see the beginning of the second see
which sector it is they know where they
are in the whole track so that this
capacity can be computed as the number
of platters times two this would really
be the number of surfaces times how many
tracks we have per surface or expressed
in another way how many cylinders do we
have on these disks
times how many sectors do we have per
track times how many bytes of data do we
have in each sector usually we have a
small number of platters such as one two
three maybe four we have thousands of
tracks per surface tens to hundreds
sectors per track and something like a
kilobyte or maybe half a kilobyte of
bytes per sector so sectors are usually
like kilobyte ish in size we have about
100 let's say sectors per track maybe a
little bit more and we have thousands of
tracks per surface obviously the whole
thing needs to be very thin so these
platters are really close to each other
it needs to be let's say two and a half
inches wide total including the head
assembly and so on so the platters are
only a couple of inches in diameter and
because we have so many tracks per
surface that means that the tracks are
spaced very very close to each other and
the head assembly needs to be very very
precise in how it positions heads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
