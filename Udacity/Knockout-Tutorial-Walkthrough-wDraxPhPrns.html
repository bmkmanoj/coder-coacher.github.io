it's an online coding um actually
framework I'm short of thing um this is
jsfiddle net on your knockout
documentation actually encouraged just
using jsfiddle and just like play with
all the knockout functionality right
just to get used to it so you don't have
to start coding your project right away
using knock out when you are not too
familiar with it so I understand that
you need to get comfortable with the
framework before you go ahead one of a
very basic example that was given in the
knockout framework I just like
personalized it and saw you know how I
could play around with it so let me show
you so the first block that is right
here on my left hand side is on the view
which is your HTML elements as you can
see I have a diff that um has two
paragraphs and a header element and then
um I have my J's called JavaScript code
right below that that defines a view
model and I have a CSS which is on the
right-hand side of my screen that is
just giving on a set of you know
formatting on styles for my page and
whatever you see on the right bottom is
the result that you get out of coding
all of this um so as you can see I have
declared a paragraph element that has a
first name and another paragraph element
that has the time of the day and what
I've done is I've just added a text box
input so I I did input data bind data
bind is the variable that performs data
binding with your arm javascript with
your view model whenever you want to
access this arm property you can access
museum based on weak binding these
bindings exactly you're actually giving
my first name an ID called first name so
here as you can see I've given value
colon first name so this is can be
taught as an ID for this and now if you
go and see my viewmodel my few model is
just
class and I'm passing my first name and
time of the day into that and what I do
is I create properties inside my
viewmodel so which is called the start
first name which is accessing the first
name from the paragraph element and it
says equals kayo dot observable off
first so whatever I pass into the first
variable goes into my this dot first
name which automatically gets updated in
the paragraph element and there is
another one which is dis da time which
actually binds it to time of the day and
it says track observe the time of the
day input and assign the value that is
passed inside this class um and here the
next line is very interesting cuz it's
called KO computed so computer is an
other property that is very similar to
the observables but what it does is it
essentially are compute the values of
other observables and it sort of gives
you a result so as you can see you have
two observables time and the first name
what I'm doing in greeting is I am
adding the time and a comma and the
first name and then giving this to the
greeting on element so this Dom element
as you can see is a header too and it
has the word good in it already and then
you have a span element that has the
greeting that goes inside followed by an
exclamation and once I finish coding the
view model class there is a line of code
that is kayo dot apply bindings of new
view model so apply bindings is very
important because this is the line that
actually makes knockout work so if you
do not have this line you might not your
application might not run so it's a lot
of times students actually miss this
part I'm so ensure that
you do have the applied bindings which
is essentially creating an instance of
your view model class and it's passing
in information here I'm just passing
purnima and morning to it so when i run
this what you can see is it says good
morning pretty much so it gives me a
whole new message right here so here as
you can see i'm going to change the
first name to gary and see it's evening
here so and then it changes the message
from your arm view which is whatever the
user sees so that that actually changes
depending on that i can probably give
another one here as well and try out i'm
gonna say goodnight Gary and probably
run this application again it's going to
give good night Gary so you can as you
can see you can update the data from the
JavaScript as well as the user point of
view and this is going to change this is
one of knockouts very important
functionality um so as you can see you
can actually create any sort of
observable any amount of observable data
sorry and then you can update it on your
user view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
