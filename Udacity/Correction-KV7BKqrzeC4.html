value right so the P of X T given all
our measurements so given this and then
we take a measurement at time T what do
we want we want the new corrected value
X of T given wise through YT so we're
folding in the new measurement all right
the way we're going to do that is we're
going to make use of Bayes rule and I'm
just going to have written down here for
those of you who don't remember Bayes
rule and don't have a tattooed on the
inside of your right thigh but here
basically is what we're doing right so
Bayes rule says that if I want to know
the probability of a given B I can flip
it around by knowing the likelihood of B
given a and then there are these other
terms in here okay and you'll notice
what we did here is we switch this
around this is now the probability of
getting the measurement given all this
previous stuff times the probability
what is this well that's just our
prediction okay that's that's p of a and
then this this is going to turn out just
to be a normalization factor by using
our independence assumption right the
independence assumption says that our
measurement YT given XT and all this
stuff is only a function of X T all
right and the reason that I refer to
this bottom part is normalization is
remember this is a probability over here
and basically they all have to sum to 1
and we'll get that later and there's
this bottom value just normalizes
everything so that it sums to one and if
you really wanted to calculate that
normalization okay what you have to do
is you have to compute all the different
possible probability of getting that YT
over all of the xt predictions over the
integral over all EXT but we are never
ever going to be sort of computing that
bottom part that's just there so you can
see what the sort of the total integral
is and in fact now it says really a
normalization so it's really really a
normalization</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
