gonna look at is what is called the
tournament barrier the value is
organized in the form of the tournament
with n players and since it's a
tournament with n players and two
players playing it against each other in
every match there are going to be login
rounds login to the base - so here is a
setup for with n equal to 8 they're
going to be they're gonna be three
rounds corresponding to login and being
8 we get three rounds the first round
second round in the third round so the
first round they're going to be four
matches p0 and p1 is one match p2 p3 p4
p5 and p6 p7 and the only catch is that
you're gonna rig this tournament in
other words what's going to happen is
that we're going to predetermine who is
going to be the winner in this round and
and particularly we're going to say
p0 is the winner for this match p2 for
this one p4 for this one and p6 for this
one so in other words the matches are
rigged in this day and age when we hear
about international scandals about
match-fixing I guess this is not too
far-fetched but what is the rationale
for match-fixing the key rationale is a
fact that if these processors are
executing on a shared memory machine
then the winner can basically sit on his
bumper and wait for processor p1 to come
over and let him know that that he has
won the match p2 can wait till p3 comes
over and so on and so forth and what
that means in a shared memory
multiprocessor is that the spin location
where p0 is waiting for p1 to come and
inform him that he's lost the match is
fixed static and and so this is the idea
behind match fixing that the the spin
location for each of these processes B 0
p2 and p4 and p6 the winners in the
first round is predetermined and that is
very very useful especially if you don't
have a cache coherent multiprocessor if
you have NCC Numa machine in that case
it is possible to locate the spin
location in the memory that is very
close to p0
Oh p2 p4 and pieces p 6 respectively
that's the idea behind this match-fixing
so the result of the first round of
matches of course p0 with advance to the
next round
p2 will advance to the next round p4 and
p6 and once again in the second run
we're gonna fix the matches and the
winner is going to be p0 for round 2 p4
4 on this bracket for round 2 and so
essentially what that means again is
that p 0 and P 4 can spend on a
statically determined location in
there's processors and P 2 and P 6
respectively we'll come over and let the
other guy know that won the match at
least for this thrown so that is the end
of the second round and and and of
course if you have you know with n equal
to 8 there only three rounds but if for
arbitrary and we're gonna have more
levels in the tree and and in every
level we're going to fix the the winners
and so it will propagate up this tree in
this fashion in terms of determining
statically we're gonna be the winners
for each round of the tournament and
this will go on all the way up to
determining who's a tournament champion
s so in this case T 0 is our lucky guy
who wins the tournament and so he was a
champion and so p0 is gonna be waiting
on a statically determined occasion
where p4 can come and signal that p0 has
won the tournament so again the
important thing that I want you to get
out of this this particular arrangement
that I mentioned is the fact that the
spin location for each of the processes
that is waiting on the other guy is
statically determined at every level so
this is the first round in the second
round
and finally the championship the
championship round</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
