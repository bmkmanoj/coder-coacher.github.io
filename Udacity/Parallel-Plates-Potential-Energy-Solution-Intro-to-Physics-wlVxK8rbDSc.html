what the potential energy is let's just
take a moment and imagine what's going
to happen when we release this charge q
well if this charge is positive it's
going to accelerate in this direction
and if this particle accelerates it's
going to gain kinetic energy and we know
from unit for that that change in
kinetic energy of the particle is equal
to the work done on the particle and
what's this work equal to well the work
is just the force that the electric
field is applying on the charge over the
distance it's being applied over this
means that if the charge moves all the
way over to the negative plate then the
work done by the field will equal the
force applied by the field times that
distance X and what's this force equal
to when we know that's just equal to
these electric field strength times the
charge of the particle all right so
putting this together we found that the
change in kinetic energy is equal to the
electric field strength times the charge
of the particle times the distance it
moves through X all right now let's use
conservation of energy to relate this
change in kinetic energy to a change in
potential energy so in this case because
there aren't any extra forces doing any
work on the charge only the field is
doing the work we know that the change
in kinetic energy is in fact exactly
equal to the change in potential energy
and the change in potential energy is
just equal to the difference between the
original potential energy and the final
potential energy and we know that if the
charge moves all the way to the negative
plate it has zero potential energy so we
can cancel out this term which leaves us
that the change in kinetic energy is
exactly equal to the original potential
energy and we know that the change in
kinetic energy is equal to eq X so this
gives us that the original potential
energy was equal to eq X so this is our
nice formula for the potential energy of
a charge in a constant electric field
and you might notice something really
cool about this this formula is actually
effectively the same as our
gravitational formula MGH in this
equation the gravitational field
strength is replaced with the electric
field strength and the mass of the
particle is replaced with the charge of
the particle and the distance away from
the negative plate is essentially the
same as the height above the ground so
what we've seen here is that this
formula is completely analogous to our
gravitational potential energy formula
which is awesome all right if you were
able to get this a crazy
great job</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
