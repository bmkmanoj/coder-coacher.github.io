the practice of implementing systems
using cryptography but there's one thing
I want to really emphasize and make sure
that you understand implementing your
own cryptography is very challenging
it's something that is very easy to do
incorrectly one example of that to keep
in mind and this is an important thing
so we we often think about programs as
black boxes with inputs and outputs and
our encryption functions will usually
take a key and a message and produce
some ciphertext and the implementations
we'll show in this class will be
functionally correct they'll produce the
correct outputs they won't be secure and
the reason they won't be secure is
things aren't really black boxes when we
use them there's lots of other things
that someone could observe about this
they could observe how long it takes and
when you can observe properties of a
function other than their functional
behavior other than just their inputs
and outputs that's called a side channel
an example of side channels timing so
the time it takes to run this function
could vary it could depend on the
message or the key most of the code that
we're going to write in this class will
have that property we're not going to be
adding complexity to our code to worry
about things like side channels but in
terms of implementing things correctly
that's really important and there are
lots of ways that code could have side
channels it could affect what's in the
cache of the processor and that could be
visible in some way it could actually
affect how much power your processor
uses and people have shown ways to break
smartcards by measuring the power
consumption as they do encryption and
that gives you some insight into what
the key is so this is just an example of
the kinds of things that it's very hard
to get right in implementing
cryptography these are things that if
you were building cryptography for any
important use you'd have to worry about
these are things we're not going to
worry about in most of the code that we
write in this class so you shouldn't
view these implementations as secure
implementations the only reason to
implement your own crypto is for fun and
learning and that's what we hope you'll
get from this class by doing it but if
you actually want to use cryptography to
protect anything important well you
should use
a library implementation that's been
carefully vetted that's been written in
a way to worry about these kinds of
issues like timing side channels and
that other people have looked at
carefully enough to have some higher
level of confidence that is correct and
secure so I want to make sure everyone
was paying careful attention to that
last point and we'll have a quiz should
you use any code from this course to
protect nuclear launch codes the answers
are no check the correct answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
