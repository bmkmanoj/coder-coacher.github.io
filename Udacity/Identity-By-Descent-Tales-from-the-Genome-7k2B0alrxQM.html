with any given relative or one of your
family members is what we call identity
by descent or IBD this is a number
that's assigned to each family member
that indicates the percentage of a
genome you would share with them based
on your common ancestors and the same
way that we have an IBS score we have an
IBD score and they're both measured from
a range of 0 to 100% but in the case of
the IBS score we generally go from a
range of about 70% to 100% right and
that's sampling snv's across the whole
genome but an IBD score can get down
pretty close to zero it's almost never
completely 0% remember we're all related
through common ancestors at some point
so we share some relations but it gets
to a very low percentage at some point
and we can be all the way up to 100%
obviously if you compare it to your own
genome or if you have an identical twin
so in a way what we're looking for here
is to see where your closest genetic
relatives are to your furthest genetic
relatives you may remember from lesson 5
when I introduced the idea of the family
rainbow right instead of the family tree
and what it allows us to do is sort of
do these categories as hierarchical
relationships using these different
colors we can fill in each tier here
right you're a hundred percent related
to you your siblings in your parents
you're 50 percent related to your half
siblings grandparents aunts uncles
you're 25 percent and then it gets
pretty complicated quickly 12.5% related
to your first cousins grand uncle's
great-grandparents and then 6.25%
related to your first cousin
once-removed
great-granddad great-great grandparents
and all kinds of other shrubby like
things coming off this tree or our
family rainbow and we can keep going out
but what I like about the family rainbow
is it allows us to organize our
relatives in a way that allows us to
easily visualize these tiers of genetic
relatedness to each other now this is
all well and good if we know our
relationship with our family members
already but how do we calculate this
percentage which is equal to the IBD the
identity by descent score for unknown
relations let's actually go talk to
somebody about how this IBD score is
determined</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
