far we have not found a polynomial time
algorithm for the three problems here we
have shown a last unit that they are
practically relevant or at least
slightly simplified versions of highly
relevant problems all the simple
problems go through an exponential
number of solutions that's what made all
of those simple algorithms so bad in
their running time or led to the
exponential running time but the thing
is going through that exponential number
of 01 assignments is also what made
those problems hard to solve if you have
given a certain assignment checking if
that is valid and how large it is for
example if it's better than a solution
you have found so far that is relatively
easy it's doable in polynomial time now
the answers to this quiz might seem
rather obvious to you and you might be
wondering what we're going to do with
those answers but I promise you it will
all make sense very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
