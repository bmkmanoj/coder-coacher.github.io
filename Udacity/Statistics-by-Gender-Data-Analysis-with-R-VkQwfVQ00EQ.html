and notice how we have friend counts
split by females and then by males and
it looks like the median and mean friend
count is greater for females so here the
answer was women now the difference
between the median friend count for men
and women is 22 that's just subtracting
these two numbers now something I want
to draw your attention to is the mean
notice how the mean for friend count is
higher than the median for both females
and for males this should make sense
since our data is long-tailed so these
higher values out and the higher friend
counts are going to pull our mean to the
right for this last question the median
is a better measure than mean because
it's a more robust statistic a few
people with huge friend counts drag the
mean upwards which isn't necessarily
representative most users what's nice is
that the medians resistant to change
since it marks the halfway point for all
data points so as long as we trust half
of our values we can report a reliable
location of the center of our
distribution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
