scientist no matter whether it's in
computational biology finance logistics
or even the Secret Service chances are
that you'll come across very tough
problems that can only be solved by a
computer or so you might think because
here's the bad news
there are literally thousands of
problems out there for which you might
think that it's simple for a computer to
solve them but actually it's very hard
if not downright impossible this course
introduces you to theoretical computer
science the area of computer science
that deals with very hard problems and I
think that even if you plan to become a
very practical computer scientist it's
vital that you know about those
theoretical concepts
plus we'll also encounter some really
fascinating and mind-boggling results
from theoretical computer science such
as deceptively simple problems that no
computer will ever be able to solve so
I'm happy to invite you to take this
journey into the science of challenging
problems</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
