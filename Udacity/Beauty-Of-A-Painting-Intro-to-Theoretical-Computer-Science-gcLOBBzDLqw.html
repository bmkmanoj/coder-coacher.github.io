that a computer can't solve it can't
appreciate the beauty of a painting for
example a computer cannot predict the
outcome of a soccer match at least not
accurately and of course a computer also
cannot see into the future and tell you
the lottery numbers of next Saturday so
at this point we have to start off a
little bit more formal and specify
exactly what kind of problems we are
talking about and what we mean when we
say we want a computer to solve a
problem for us and we will do this
through three requirements these
requirements might seem very obvious to
you but later on in this unit you will
see that these requirements actually
have some very very important
consequences so the laws of computer
problems rule number 15 computer problem
the input must be given to us as a
finite string using a constant number of
symbols at each position in the string
the input for a computer problem could
for example be a number of zeros and
ones it's not infinite so it has a
defined end and by constant number of
symbols I mean constant number of
symbols at each place so in this case at
each place in the string we either have
a zero or one here we could have a zero
or one here we could have a 0 or 1 and
so on you could also have a string like
this again it's finite in length and
this time we're using the real alphabet
so it doesn't really matter what kind of
symbols you use as long as the number is
constant and that is basically the same
requirement that we already had when we
discuss the RAM because for the RAM we
also said that at each memory cell we
could only have a finite number of
symbols so no variable can become
arbitrarily large and the same thing is
here we cannot use an arbitrarily large
alphabet at each point of the string
rule number two is exactly the same as
rule number one with one exception
instead of input we write output so we
also want the output to be given as a
finite string using a constant number of
symbols actually we could even restrict
ourselves to decision problems here but
we're going to keep it general so you
give the computer a string and you
expect it to output a string and then
finally rule number three is that going
to be as surprising as rule number one
and rule number two yes it is because
rule number three is going to be that if
we get an output then we want that
output to be a correct answer to our
problem and that is one important point
answer where we can objectively say that
it is correct the moment it is given to
us and it is supposed to be definitive
so we do not want the computer to say oh
let me work on this for a little bit
longer when it produces the output
that's supposed to be the answer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
