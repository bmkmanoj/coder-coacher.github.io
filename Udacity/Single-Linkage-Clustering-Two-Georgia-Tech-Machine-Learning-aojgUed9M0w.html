process so what what you would think of
doing next
well DN F and B and G we both thought
were pretty close so let's just do DN f
well DN f doesn't matter much anymore
because they're already in the same
cluster oh that's a good point
so what is what is their inter cluster
distance it's zero yes they're in the
same cluster that's a fine point you
make there Michael sure how about B and
G then I like B and G and what do we do
next well we've got two nice clusters so
actually if we were to merge the next
cluster we would end up with I guess B
and D together it doesn't really matter
because it's gonna merge the last two
clusters together yeah so in particular
what I was what I was getting at is we
don't do any any merging necks because
now this repeat loop is done so that's
this is what we end up with assuming
that we hit start off setting K equals
two then then we're done at this point
we have what looks like a backwards R
and a funny-looking actually they look
like Hebrew letters to me but that's
probably not a universal perspective so
just one other thing to point out
quickly so we can repin represent the
series of merges that we did using a
structure that's kind of like this we
merged a and B first and then we merged
C and D and then we merged
I think D and E yeah or the C D and E
and then we merged a and F and then we
merged G and the a B cluster and then
that left us with the two clusters so
this in some sense that we've captured
the same information about what's
connected with what but this is kind of
a nice way of representing it because it
actually gives us a hierarchical
structure a tree structure a kind of
hierarchical agglomerative structure and
there's lots of applications where it's
actually useful to have that that extra
bit of information because we can now
very easily look at remember in the
beginning you said that you could see
three clusters well you can see if you
just cut this tree structure here we get
we get the three oh not quite we almost
get the three clusters that you wanted
here it looks like f is separated from
the other words it depends which which
distances we thought were closer and
also if you combine those two clusters
again the last two clusters then
basically you have a true tree with a
single root that's right and that's kind
of that summarizes all the different
cluster structures that you can get out
of single link clustering mmm like that
so I have a question Michael
shoot
we'll have two questions the first
question is do you know the difference
between further and farther I do though
I sometimes use them interchangeably
yeah it turns out I'm interestingly
enough that the definitions of further
and farther switch every hundred years
or so
and unfortunately I was born in a time
period where they're switching meetings
again and so it drives me nuts but in
any case for our listeners further
farther means physical distance and
further means metaphysical or
metaphorical distance so one lives
farther down the road but goes further
into death and you should almost never
confuse the two the people currently are
using further as if it means farther so
I have a question here for you which is
you define the inter-cluster distance as
the distance between the closest two
points in the two clusters yep that's
what it says right here yeah as if that
were an immutable fact of the algorithm
is it or could we do something else what
would happen if we pick average distance
or distance between the farthest two
points as opposed to furthest two points
or some other measure well we don't know
if this is physical distance or
metaphorical distance right or
metaphysical distance it's just D that's
true but so it's like we'll call it for
this with a no please don't
the for this point yes good an average
is another one that's true yeah these
are different things you could define I
my recollection of this is they're no
longer single link clustering single
link clustering is defined to be closest
but you also have other things like
average link clustering which I think is
the one with the average and then
there's maybe max link clustering I
forget exactly what it's called
which does the four list I think I saw I
saw a talk one since I didn't understand
which had to do with median distances
and that somehow you could prove
interesting things be covered because of
it as opposed to the the mean which is
what I think you mean by average there
yeah Everage average meaning mean yeah I
mean generally things like median are
really good if the numbers on the
distances don't matter just their
orderings hmm so sometimes people
describe that as being metric versus non
metric non-metric median is usually a
non metric statistic
which is a metric statistic it actually
the details of the numbers matter a lot
okay well they don't make sense I guess
the basic idea is that what I was saying
before that the distance was some notion
of where your domain knowledge comes in
I guess it's also true that the how you
define inter cluster distance is also a
kind of domain knowledge
it's another parameter to the algorithm
that's impaired yeah okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
