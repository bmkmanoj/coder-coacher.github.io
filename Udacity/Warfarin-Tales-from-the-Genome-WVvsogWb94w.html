that acts by binding and inhibiting a
protein called vko rc1 now vko rc1
normally helps recycle vitamin K it
takes it from its epoxidized form to its
reduced form now it may not sound like
much it's still vitamin K there's a
chemical change going on here but that's
a huge difference in allowing a certain
kind of vitamin k to promote blood
clotting vko rc1 recycles this vitamin k
and promotes the production of reduced
vitamin k that promotes blood clotting
now warfarin is an anticoagulant or
something that inhibits blood clotting
because it actually blocks the activity
of v KO rc1 if you block v KO r c1 then
you can't get the EPOXI dyes form of
vitamin k back to the reduced form so
you don't get as much blood clotting
you've inhibited blood clotting now most
of us realize that blood clotting is a
good thing especially when you hurt
yourself and you get an injury on your
skin and your your blood starts spilling
out you want it to stop spilling out so
it clots and that's a good thing but
sometimes blood clotting can happen
inside your blood vessels inside your
arteries and anytime that happens it
could be really bad because we're gonna
block the flow of blood in your body so
if you have an overactive blood clotting
system you might be at more risk of
blocking vessels and if you have an
underactive blood clotting system you
may not have enough clotting when you
need it when you get injured now the
efficacy of warfarin or its
effectiveness is measured by how well it
inhibits this overall vitamin k
recycling a measure of how effective it
is at inhibiting v KO r c1 so which of
the following would result in an
increased or higher efficacy of warfarin
strong inhibition of v KO r c1 or a weak
inhibition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
