wants to sell something what's sitting
in between them
a form if you think about registration
company wants to grow their user base
someone wants to be part of that
community or product or they have and
again what's between them is a form so
in all these places where this
connection happens between the
organizations that make things on the
internet and the people that use those
things there's generally a form and
those forms as you say consist of input
fields the biggest mistake that I think
people make is treating those things
from what I would call almost a back end
perspective that is inside of a data
base to simplify things you have these
name value pairs right name and then a
field for what the name is and you've
got a whole bunch of these things and
they constitute something like the
record of a user or a purchase and when
it comes time to collect that
information to fill it fill in that
database what you do is you just spit
out those name value pairs as input
fields and labels and had a job done
with the form so both of these things I
learned almost the hard way if you will
at eBay about how to think about them
differently when I was at eBay many
years ago it was the 28th largest
economy in the world
so lots and lots of people buying and
selling things on there and we found
that when we made small changes to these
forms we could really have a huge impact
in fact when we redesigned the
registration form process we had to go
back to Wall Street and restate earnings
because that was how tremendous the
impact was and when you think about the
ability for something like a forum to
impact something like the 28th largest
economy in the entire planet you really
start to understand the importance of
all little details in the forms and that
goes well beyond which name value pairs
you include how you put the labels in
what kind of form control you use what
kind of feedback you give to people as
they're filling in this information how
do you organize it what do you do to
message the before and after parts of
the form because it's part of a broader
flow and so the biggest mistake is
really not considering that full
envelope a form design and really just
regurgitating a databases fields onto a
screen and putting a submit button on
the bottom</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
