analysis where we show that each phase
of the denature algorithm takes V times
E time as with edmonds-karp we will use
a level graph in this case however the
algorithm actually builds the graph
whereas in edmonds-karp we simply used
it for the analysis the level graph can
be built by running breadth-first search
and saving all forward edges while
ignoring backwards and lateral ones as
we argued before when we augment a flow
along a path say along this one here we
introduce Reverse edges into the
residual graph note that these are
always backwards edges in the level
graph and hence they aren't useful in
building a path equal to or shorter than
the previous shortest path well if the
new edges are useless why rebuild the
level graph of the residual graph when
the old one will serve just as well we
can just update the residual capacities
more precisely given the possibly
outdated level graph we can build a path
from source to sink just by making the
first vertex on the adjacency list the
next vertex in the path if this
generates a path to t then we augment
the flow and update the residual
capacities if it doesn't then we delete
the last vertex in the path from the
level graph in this example we would
first find a path from s to T and let's
say that this edge here is a bottleneck
its capacity gets set to 0 and it gets
deleted next we would build a path from
s again and this time we would run into
a dead end so we delete this vertex and
continue there are only V vertices in
the graph so we can't run into more than
V dead ends and every augmentation
deletes the bottleneck edge so we can't
delete more than e edges overall then we
won't try more than a paths this process
however of building the path by first in
the adjacency list and then augmenting
at or deleting a vertex as appropriate
each time that set of operations is done
only cost us order V time so overall
then we're doing order V work order e
times so overall this work takes order V
times E
taking this all together then we have V
phases and each one of the individual
phases costs order e times V time for a
total of e times V squared time overall
which is an improvement over
edmonds-karp</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
