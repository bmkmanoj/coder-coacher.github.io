do so I said that the picture would
intentionally walk the batter in
baseball is something called a force out
that occurs when every base before a
particular base is filled here the
second and third bases are filled but
the first base isn't filled since
there's only two outs they only one more
out the guy at the inning and so the
easiest way to get out of the inning
might be to have a force out available
so I say that the picture should
intentionally walk the batter to create
that force out opportunity David it's
clear that you know more about baseball
than I do so I assume that your answer
is the right one but notice what is
happening here david has a lot of
knowledge about baseball and he's using
that knowledge to make a decision how is
he using his knowledge to make the
decision what is the architecture what
is the reasoning that leads him to make
that specific decision this is one of
the things we learn in this lesson how
might intelligent agents make complex
decisions about the world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
