we can actually get this really quickly
let's think about how we can start to
simplify this by multiplying out the
first two sets of parentheses if we do
this then the first expression we have
is going to be x squared minus 4x minus
12 and then this of course is still
multiplied by X minus 4 now to further
simplify this we know that we have to
multiply every term in this first set of
parentheses by each of the terms over
here so let's think carefully about this
for a moment if you multiply anything
over here by x squared it's going to
have a factor of x squared in it so
that's not going to give us a constant
the same is true if we multiply anything
by negative 4x since there are no terms
over here that would cancel out that X
now if instead we multiply something
over here by negative 12 we do have the
potential to come up with a constant
term if we multiply a negative 12 times
X well that's going to give us negative
12x that won't work it has an X in it
the last combination of terms is what's
going to give us the answer we're
looking for a constant negative 12 times
negative 4 gives us 48 and remember this
negative 12 came from multiplying the
constants in the first two expressions
that we multiplied together the real way
we get 48 is by multiplying all of the
constants involved in these expressions
in the original factored form negative 6
times 2 times negative 4 is what gives
us 48</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
