me where we're going here so just as a
reminder I've erased a bunch of stuff so
I can make some room we're trying to
maximize this cost function J Prime so
pi which is basically the sum of the
mutual information between every single
feature and its parents and I want to
point out that that actually induces a
graph in fact a fully connected graph so
here I've drawn a bunch of nodes as part
of a graph and all the edges between
them each one of these nodes is going to
represent a feature an X of I and what's
going to go on the edges is going to be
the mutual information between them so I
now have a fully connected graph which
has the mutual information between each
pair of nodes all N squared edges and I
want to find a sub graph of this graph
in particular a tree that maximizes
these sums so any ideas how I do that
Michael first off does that make sense
what I just said yeah yeah yeah I mean
it's it's very interesting right so
we're trying to pick each time we pick
an edge it's actually saying that what
we're gonna care about the relationship
between this pair of variables and we're
only allowing edges we're not allowing
because they that involves two nodes
we're not getting sets of three or five
or however many nodes larger than that
and so we want is we want to be
considering a subset of edges that form
a tree that has the highest total
information content this is that and
that's a minimum spanning tree well not
quite that's a maximum spanning tree
that's exactly right it turns out that
finding the tree consistent with this
graph such that this is true is in fact
the same thing as finding the maximum
spanning tree which we all vaguely
remember from our algorithms class so
you said it was terribly painful but
it's actually not this it's terribly
easily painful so that's really neat we
turn the problem of finding the best
distribution and in particular the best
dependency tree independent of the true
underlying distribution I want to point
out into a problem of a well known well
understood computer science problem of
finding the maximum spanning tree if we
find the maximum spanning tree then we
have found the best dependency tree so
to be honest I don't remember maximum
spanning tree minimum spanning tree can
we just solve the maximum spanning tree
problem by I don't know negating the
edges or yeah at it
okay that's exactly right so everywhere
in there where you pick a max you pick
them in or you just label them with the
negative of the mutual information and
it's the same thing I think that this
particular form of writing is a maximum
mutual information is easier to think
about okay and what you'll do when you
find the maximum spanning tree is you'll
end up with in fact some tree and you're
done well so now you need to tell me
because the structure was a directed
structure so do it can we then pick any
node and call it the root and then do a
like a depth-first traversal or
something absolutely so first off I want
to point out there's two different
algorithms that you could use do
remember the two items you could use to
find the maximum spanning tree or the
two famous ones anyway I'm gonna go with
prim and Cresskill but I know there's
others no those are the two that they
teach you an algorithms class and it
turns out for this particular one you
want to use prim because prim is proper
it is proper prim and proper
prim is the proper algorithm to use
whenever you have a strongly connected
graph it just happens to be faster you
mean densely connected graph what did I
say strongly okay densely connected
right a densely connected graph and by
the way this is a fully connected graph
which is about as dense a connected
graph as you can get so prims algorithm
runs in time quadratic or polynomial
anyway in the number of edges and so
it's actually fairly efficient as things
go because as we know in theory if it's
polynomial it might as well be free
there you go so use prims algorithm you
find the maximum spanning tree and you
are done all right I'm gonna need
reminding where we where this is all
plugging in okay cool diversion but
right so this is actually worth pointing
out that this was a bit of a diversion
that we had to do let's go back to the
original algorithm that we had and and
just point out what we would be doing
