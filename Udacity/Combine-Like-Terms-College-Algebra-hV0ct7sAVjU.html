to put parentheses around 3w plus 12 n
or the total amount of money the grant
would have gained from the orders that
have not been cancelled was because this
is one sum of money we want to subtract
the whole thing not just part of it if
we didn't have parentheses here then we
would only be subtracting the money that
he would have earned from the wipers
that are now cancelled but we would
still be adding the amount of money that
he would have gotten from the nozzle
orders that are not canceling we know
that both of these sets of orders have
been cancelled so we need to make sure
that both of them are subtracted from
the original sum of money so let's put
those parentheses back however I don't
really want these parentheses here in
the end version of this expression so we
need to get rid of them somehow
intuitively like i just said i want to
subtract both this quantity 3w the money
from the canceled wiper orders and this
quantity 12 n the money from the
canceled nozzle sales so we want to
subtract both of them and if i get rid
of these parentheses i should just be
able to switch this plus sign to a minus
sign and have the expression that I want
this makes sense here's our original
amount of money that grant would have
earned from all of the orders that he
had and then we take away both the
wipers that he's not selling anymore and
the nozzles he's not selling anymore
that makes sense now the problem is
simple you've done this so many times
before you just need to rearrange the
order of the term so that like terms are
next to each other and then simplify so
first we rearrange the order of the
terms so that W terms are next to each
other and the end terms are next to each
other and let me just add their
coefficients together and multiply by
the proper variables so eighty seven
minus three is 84 and the variable there
is W and 72 minus 12 is 60 and the
variable there is n so here's our final
answer 84 w plus 60 an awesome job that
quiz had a bunch of steps in it and some
new material so if you got it even
partially right that's really great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
