parents a mom and a dad and each parent
passes down one copy of their
chromosomes here I've color coded them
for you to make it easier to see your
blue chromosomes came from dad and your
pink chromosomes came from mom in the
same way that your parents gave you
their chromosomes one day you're going
to pass down your chromosomes to a child
of your own but the question is what
will they look like now because of
meiosis which we learned about in lesson
5 recombination causes a parent's
chromosome paired to mix and match their
information roughly equally so when you
have kids your chromosomes in your germ
cells when they undergo meiosis are
actually going to exchange pieces of
information so that no longer do you
have these discrete individual
chromosomes the set you got from mom and
they set you got from that but you're
going to mix and match the information
you got from mom and dad on the
chromosomes so the chromosomes that you
pass down to your child will actually be
a mix and match of your own parents
chromosomes that they gave to you but
every time recombination happens during
meiosis for each of your germ cells
every time a new sex seller gamete is
made a different recombination happens
and the set of chromosomes that you pass
down to one child will actually be a
different Nixon match of your own
parents chromosomes then another child
you pass down those chromosomes to there
are virtually an infinite number of
combinations for this to happen so even
though each of these children is
receiving half of their chromosomes from
you the parent the half that you give
one child is roughly only about half the
same as the set you give to the other
child for any given parent you and a
full sibling only share about fifty
percent of the same genetic information
since it's the same for both parents
together you're considered about 50%
related to each other through both
parents because it's about the same
through individual parents and it all
has to do with recombination so overall
we can look at identity by state so
understanding the effects of
recombination and the fact that a
50-percent relation between siblings
is not the same thing as a 50-percent
relation between parent and child what
would you assume if you found a one
hundred percent relatedness with someone
