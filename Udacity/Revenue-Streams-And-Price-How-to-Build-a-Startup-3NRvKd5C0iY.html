about now are what are my revenue
streams and next within the revenue
streams how do i price the product so
let's take a look what exactly is a
revenue stream a revenue stream is the
strategy the company uses to generate
cash from each customer segment so if
you have multiple customer segments
you may have multiple revenue streams
we'll go into this in some detail but
let's define pricing pricing are the
tactics you use to set the price
how many dollars or pounds or is it free
in each of these customer segments so
now let's go back and look at the
revenue stream in some detail first
couple of questions you need to answer
is number one what value are customers
willing to pay for well how do you know
this well on day one you're just sitting
in your building or in your classroom in
your lab and you're guessing you're
going hey these are my customers guess
you know these are the features they
care about guess this is the value
they're going to pay for guess but by
now you've been in front of a ton of
customers you've talked to them just
extensively and you understand what it
is they value and that's what we're
going to use to figure out what the
revenue streams in pricing are the next
thing that you actually found out
outside the building was how do
customers pay for products today also
you want to understand how much are they
paying so how do they pay and how much
they pay so little for big picture let's
go take a look at the revenue stream
choices at the highest possible level</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
