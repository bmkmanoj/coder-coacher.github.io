sitting in class your professor is
telling you everything that's going to
be on your exam and you really need to
write all this down but you forgot a pin
so the girl next to you lend you one
okay now you have your pin back to
focusing on what the professor is saying
and ignoring the fact that the room is
freezing and the guy to your right is
smacking his gum oh man there's so much
on the slide to write down before the
professor moves on hurry right right
right but wait why are people laughing
you look around and you notice that
people are looking at a guy standing
outside the window with roses and a huge
sign that says I love you Tori be mine
the girl next to you so that guy recited
a poem using like ten poster boards
while doing interpretive dance how on
earth did you miss that well back to
writing before the slide changes you're
almost done writing the list of topics
for your final when here two people
behind you talking about your favorite
band and saying they're going to the
concert next week oh man you've got to
get tickets for that concert oh no the
side just changed okay now you have to
focus on your professors closing remarks
because this is the essay portion of the
exam you know it's going to be hard but
you can do it ok so now class is over
you turn to give the pin back to the
girl you borrowed it from but you notice
that she's not there it's a guy sitting
next to you and he's sleeping on his
desk when did that happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
