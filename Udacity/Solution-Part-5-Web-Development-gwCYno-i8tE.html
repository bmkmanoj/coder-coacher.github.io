we'll give you all this code so you can
reference it in future stuff and then
here's the CSS I used to actually style
the whole page we don't cover much CSS
in this class but you can learn from
what I've done here on the body tag I
basically set the font to be Helvetica
font size 14
you know I set the width to be 800 this
margin basically this is a trick for
centering content add a little padding
make the color slightly off black you
know three through three instead of zero
zero zero we define when we use h2 we
set the font size of 20 for bold some
space on the bottom that's what margin
bottom does errors are read labels we
can make it a block element font size 20
this says if the label follows another
label put some space in between them 20
pixels this input type text formats our
text box we so we make it with 500
pixels font size 20 a little padding
inside the box that just kind of spaces
things out a little bit I use a mono
space font for entering text you know it
makes it look like you're writing on a
typewriter or something textarea going
to make it 500 pixels so it matches the
input make it 400 pixels tall so we get
a nice actual box 17 pixels thought make
our submit button a little bigger this
is the main title of the page where it
says CS 253 that's size 40 text it's
bold its centered it's got some space
below it and it's actually a link to the
front of the blog but I don't want to
underline there which is what HTML does
by default when you have links so we can
say text-decoration:none which turns off
that underlined this says 15 pixels
between two blog posts post heading now
this is the actual title of a particular
blog post so we've got that name this
adds that border that line on the bottom
position:relative is used for something
else which I'll show you in a sec title
ball 24 pixels tall the date the blog
was submitted this is position:absolute
well position:absolute lets you say is
we want to position this 0 pixels from
the right edge of our parents if that
parent is positioned relative which is
why we have position:relative here and 0
pixels from the bottom of that parent in
this case we're making it color 9 9 9
which is kind of great so if we were to
go back into our browser this whole
thing is the blog heading this is the
title and this is that created date
which is position:absolute which is
position zero pixels on the right and
zero pixels on the bottom and that's how
we position that over here nicely on the
right in its color 999 which is great
and so that's just some basic CSS I
think there's just a little bit more
content the post content has five pixels
on the top that separates it from its
heading a little bit you can see we've
got that big text here when I mouse over
it you can see my cursor turns into a
little hand which means it's a link but
I got rid of that underline and then you
can see all the the fonts were used here
and the border bottom we added here to
make this line and and then the texting
to these posts you know you don't have
to understand that you don't need to do
it in any of our homeworks because we
can't grade easily the appearance of
your things but I like to do it so it
looks you know slightly nicer and so I
figured I'll show you how I did that
that is it for homework 3 that was
actually quite a bit if you made it this
far good job you are writing some
serious web applications now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
