different coverage metrics I'd like to
return to a topic that I discussed at
the beginning of this unit which is the
input domain what coverage is letting us
do is divide up the input domain into
regions in such a way for any given
region any test input within that region
will accomplish some specific coverage
task any input that we select within
this particular region of the input
domain will cause a particular statement
or line to execute cause a branch to
execute in some specific direction
execute a loop 0 times one time or more
etc and so the obvious problem is if we
partition the input domain this way and
we go ahead and test it using a point
from each region in the input domain
we're going to get good coverage but
we're not going to be able to do is find
errors of omission that is to say
nothing about this process of selecting
points in the input domain and testing
them in order to achieve good coverage
is going to let us discover what we
haven't implemented so let me give a
quick example so typically as we talked
about in unit 2 the software under test
is using api's provided by the system
perhaps the system under test is
creating files on the hard disk one
extremely plausible kind of bug we would
put into the system under test is
failing to check error codes that could
be returned from file creation
operations that happen when the disk is
full or when there's a hard disk failure
or something like that and so what I
really mean here is that for example
we've gotten full for branch coverage of
the system under test but there just
isn't a branch in the test that should
have been taken when the hard disk
returns an error code and so if the
branch that should be there isn't there
when the disk does return an error code
something weird is going to happen the
software is going to fail and so the
fundamental fact here is that coverage
metrics are not particularly good at
discovering errors of omission like
missing error checks to discover those
we need to use other methods so for
example we discuss fault injection where
we make the disc fail where we make it
send something bad up to the system and
we see what happens and in that case if
we're missing an error check then the
system should actually do the wrong
thing and we'll be able to discover this
by watching the system misbehave another
thing we could have done is partition
the input domain in a different way that
is to say not partition the input domain
using an automated coverage metric but
rather partition the input domain using
the specification so if we partition the
input domain based on the specification
and the specification mentions the need
for our system to respond gracefully to
disk errors there's going to be some
little corner of the input space that's
triggered only when disks fail and we'll
actually test that so the point that I'm
getting to here is there are multiple
ways of partitioning the input domain
and for purposes of testing partitioning
the input domain based on features of
the code is one way and it happens to be
quite effective in general but says it
can't find errors of omission we also
want to sample the input domain in
different ways we also want to sample
the input domain in other ways and
that's a theme that will return to in
full force in units four five and six
alright so that wraps up our quick
survey of test coverage metrics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
