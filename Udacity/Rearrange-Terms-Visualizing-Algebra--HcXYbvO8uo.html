work if you got that one correct you
might have done this in a couple of ways
let's check out one of the methods if we
switch the middle two terms we can see
that will get a common factor of n in
the first terms and a common factor of
five p in the second terms if we factor
a 7 n from the first two terms will be
left with 2 m and positive one and if we
factor at 5p from the second term will
be left with 1 and positive 2 m these
two factors might appear different but
we just want to switch the order of
these two terms remember addition is
commutative now that we can see there's
a common factor of 2 M plus 1 in the
first term and 2m plus 1 and the second
term we factor again which leaves us
with our factored form 7 and plus Phi P
times 2n plus 1 but we could have
regrouped the terms in another way I
could have grouped this first term and
this last term together and then kept
the middle two terms together as well if
we factor a 2 m from these first two
terms will be left with 7n and Phi P now
in this last group of terms there's only
a greatest common factor of 1 they don't
share any variable factors are number
factors notice that I have seven in plus
5 p + 7 n plus 5 p and these two
parentheses this is the next common
factor so our two factors are 2n plus 1
+ 7 + + 5p notice that these answers are
exactly the same we just switch the
order of the multiplication this first
parentheses represents a number and the
second parentheses also represents a
number so it would be like two times
three would be the same as three times
to our multiplication is commutative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
