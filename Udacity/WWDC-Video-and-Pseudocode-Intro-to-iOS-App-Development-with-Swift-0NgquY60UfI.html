pitch example and I came across a Stack
Overflow page that was promising by the
way a link to this website is also
available in the instructor notes this
page pointed me to some code and also
highlighted a video on a website called
WWDC now WWDC or worldwide developer
conference is an annual event Apple
hosts in California where Apple
engineers showcase new technologies to
software developers one Radeon this
website was particularly helpful
it's called AV audio engine in practice
I looked through this video and
discovered a new way of working with
sound in iOS 8 a link to this video is
also available in the instructor notes
and I recommend that you bookmark it now
and watch it later by the way you will
need the Safari browser to play this
video this video and the previous Stack
Overflow page led me to some code and
here is that code now before I run this
I want you to read through this and see
if you can translate this code into
simple English by the way this is the
sort of activity that expert software
engineers will do on a daily basis see
if you can make reasonable guesses about
what's going on here and then you can
submit your answer in this box you can
refer to the lines in this code by the
line numbers that are provided here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
