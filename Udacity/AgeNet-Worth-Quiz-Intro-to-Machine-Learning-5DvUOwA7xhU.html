in the regressions documentation for SK
learn let's deploy it on our ages net
worths problem so you can really see how
it works here's how I'm going to have
you do this I've created a data set of
net worths and ages then I've split it
into training and testing sets just like
we do in supervised classification I've
plotted the training data here so you
can see that there's definitely a
general trend in the data where as you
get older your net worth goes up but
I've also added a little bit of noise to
the data so that it's not a perfect
relationship it's a little bit more true
to life in that respect however the way
that I generated the data was using the
equation that Sebastian was using in the
previous few videos so I start with an
age and then I calculate a net worth
using the coefficient of 6.25 so the
answer that we get out when we perform
our regression when we fit it should
give us a coefficient that's pretty
close to 6.25 although not exactly
because of this noise that I've mixed in
here so this is the training data and
this is what you should get once you
perform your regression in this
scatterplot I now have the training data
but I also have the testing data which
I've colored in red so you can
distinguish the points using the blue
points I fit a line which I've drawn in
here this is the result of the
regression and when I overlay it on
these points you can immediately see
that it seems to be capturing the trend
in the data pretty well also using this
line I can use it to predict the net
worth of anyone with an age between 20
and 65 or so so this is what we're going
for in the end let me show you a little
bit of the setup code that I've given
you and in the quiz I'll have you fill
in the blanks so when you get into the
quiz here's what it's going to look like
I create training and testing data for
you with the ages and the net worths
that you're going to be using and then
the meet of the regression is actually
going to be in this student reg function
I'll take you over there in just a
second so you know what it will look
like but what you need to do with this
is return a fitted regression which then
I'm going to be using in this plotting
code down here so I put in my testing
ages and then the predictions that I
make for my testing age is using my
fitted regression and that's going to
give me the line that you see so okay
what is student reg doing well the first
thing is I know that I'm sending the
training
ages data and net worths data and what I
want you to do here are a few things
first is importing the SK learn
regression module and then you want to
create and train your regression you
want to name your regression reg because
you're going to be returning an object
named reg so it will be looking for
something with that name so that's the
assignment in the quiz give it a shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
