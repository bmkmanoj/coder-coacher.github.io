notice about the supplied code is that
in the array angles the angles are
measured in degrees but as we said
earlier the cosine and sine functions
and pythons math library take arguments
that are measured in radians not in
degrees it's the first thing that we
need to do is convert each of the angles
in the array angles into radians we do
that by multiplying each angle by PI and
dividing by 180 this gives us this new
variable angle and radians or angle rod
the next step is to set the initial
position and velocity of the particle as
you can see from these two lines you've
decided that the particle is going to
begin at 0 in both the horizontal and
vertical planes this means that it's
starting at the origin moving on to
velocity we set both the horizontal and
the vertical velocity by taking the
initial speed which we set up here and
multiplying by the cosine of the angle
which we just converted for the
horizontal velocity or the sign for the
vertical velocity lastly we finally make
use of the forward Euler Euler method if
we want to find out what the position
after the next step is going to be then
we begin with the position at the
stepped over at and then add the time
step times the velocity at that present
step you'll remember that this makes
sense in terms of units because age is
measured in time and V is measured in
distance over time which makes this term
also measured in distance just like X we
do something very similar with velocity
except at this time the acceleration is
a constant which we set up here as a
gravitational constant this means that
the value of the acceleration is not
going to change from step to step
although the value of the velocity will
something else that you might want to
note is that we've only set the range to
go from zero to numb steps minus one you
might initially have thought that we
should insert numb steps plus one as the
argument of the range but because we're
looking at the step plus one row in both
X and V we need to restrict the range to
be one less than we would have otherwise
made it in fact I made this error myself
when I was looking over the code so it
makes perfect sense if you were thinking
that too after all this has been filled
in we can run the program and get this
plot now this is a plot of the position
not of the velocity you can see
the horizontal access measures the
horizontal position in meters the
vertical axis measures the vertical
position in meters each different series
here corresponds to each different
element in the angles array which you
can see because each of these particles
is leaving out in a different initial
angle from this graph we can see that as
we change the initial angle we also
drastically change where the particle is
going to end up landing now we'll move
on to a problem that combines both this
idea of ballistic trajectory and the
idea of orbits from the previous problem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
