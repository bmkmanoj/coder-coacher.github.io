would work just fine we could we could
make it work in all cases it makes a
necessary distinction and in each of
these cases the entries in this column
are greater than the entries in this
column and so max could do the job but
it seems to me that the case with tuples
is the most convenient here with the
these integers or reals we'd have to be
doing very complicated arithmetic to add
things up and then break them apart to
make sure we got the right answer but
with the tuples it's simple we just use
the comma operator we say start with the
seven add in what we have four of a kind
of an ad in what we have the remaining
one card of and that gives you the three
values we don't have to deal with any
complicated arithmetic now if you aren't
familiar with tuples you might want a
little bit of practice to understand how
they work and we said that 795 is
greater than 7 32 so in other words this
expression is a true expression in
Python and the way the evaluation works
is you first look at the first element
if one of them is greater than that
element is greater if they're the same
then you go on to the second element so
in this case 7 is equal to seven so we
move on nine is greater than three and
so that means this guy is greater than
that guy you might have seen the similar
type of thing in ordering between
strings so we can have the string hello
and compare that to the string help and
we do it in exactly the same way that we
could compare two poles we go left to
right and H compares to H they're the
same so we move on to the next character
he compares to e they're the same so we
move on to the next l is equal to L move
on and here we have an L
in a P and P comes later in the alphabet
than L so help would be greater than
hello or hello would be less than help
the same type of idea and this is known
as lexa graphic or during its so called
because lex meaning words this is a way
that words are ordered but we use the
same name when we're comparing strings
or when we're comparing lists of numbers
or list of any other type of value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
