properties and perhaps you've even
noticed some commonalities between them
for example properties like width height
and padding all expect values that
express length and much like
measurements in real life these
properties use units to describe lengths
in real life we use units like meters
miles feet and centimeters to describe
length but in CSS we use units like
pixels and percentages CSS units like
pixels and percentages can be
categorized into two distinct groups
absolute and relative units absolute
units refer to fixed units of
measurement relative units refer to
units that are a comparison to another
length property consider this example of
a road if I'm describing how wide it is
in absolute units I would say something
like the road is 7.2 meters wide but if
I'm describing how wide it is in
relative units I might say something
like the road is 2 car lengths wide the
car length is relative to the average
length of a car and can change over time
so how does this look in CSS if we look
at this example we have a property width
being passed the value 400 pixels 400 is
our number value and pixels is our unit
of measurement pixels are an absolute
form of measurement that corresponds to
one physical device pixel on your
display any modern screen be it a screen
on a mobile device tablet laptop desktop
monitor our television is made up of
millions of pixels we can use these
pixels to define exact length we want to
pass two properties but pickles aren't
the only unit of measurement used in CSS
there are actually a lot more for
absolute units pixels are the most
common however there are others like
millimeters inches and centimeters but
these are rarely if ever used for
relative units we already know about
percentages but there are others like
M's viewport width and viewport height
percentages are the most common relative
unit but you won't be using them for a
few lessons you'll use relative units
more when you start learning about
responsive design we'll stick with
pixels for now for a full list of units
refer to one of the CSS reference
