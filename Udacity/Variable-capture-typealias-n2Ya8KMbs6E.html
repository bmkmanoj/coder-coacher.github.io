at a concept that will be very useful in
our examples of variable capture
actually the fancy name for this is
capture of lexical environment feel free
to drop this in any casual conversation
if you really want to look like a nerd
an alias is a simple way of calling
something or someone that has a complex
or funny name for example say you're a
huge professional wrestler and you want
your name to scare the crap out of your
opponent you seriously think Terry gene
bullet will do of course that's why he
goes by his type alias Hulk Hogan or
you're just starting your career as a
pop singer but your parents bestow'd
upon you the aristocratic sounding name
of Florian cloud the one real Armstrong
it certainly sounds impressive but your
fans will have a hard time remembering
it better go buy the tape alias dido and
Swift you can also give new names to
existing types and this is extremely
useful when the original name is complex
something like being able to call is ur
daniella which demsky Kirk Douglas much
better don't you think so let's see a
few examples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
