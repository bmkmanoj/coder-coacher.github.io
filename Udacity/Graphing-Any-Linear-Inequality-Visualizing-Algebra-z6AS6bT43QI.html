that are not in slope-intercept form we
can handle these inequalities much like
we did linear equations we can try and
solve this inequality for y first I
subtract X from both sides to get
negative 4y is less than or equal to
negative 12 minus X I'm going to
rearrange the terms here so i'll have
negative 4y less than or equal to
negative x minus 12 notice that the sign
in front of the term stays with it the x
is still negative as before and this 12
is still negative as before finally we
divide every term by negative 4 here's
where we need to be very careful we're
dividing by a negative and this is an
inequality symbol just like from before
we know we need to reverse the
inequality sign the other thing we want
to watch out for are the negatives on
the other side a negative divided by a
negative makes it positive and the same
is true here so we're left with y is
greater than or equal to one-fourth X
plus 3 and don't forget about that one
as the coefficient in front of X that's
how we can get positive one fourth now
that we have this inequality we can
graph it just like before we'll start by
plotting the line then we'll determine
whether or not that line should be
dashed or solid and finally we could
determine the region by using a test
point we plug in a point to see if it
makes it inequality true if it does we
want that region if not we'll take the
other one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
