for each region I've picked out a value
to test to see whether or not it
satisfies our inequality first let's
test x equals negative 11 now you might
think that we need to actually plug
negative Levin in and find out all the
numbers here but all you really care
about is the sign of this entire
expression we just want to know whether
or not it's positive so what I'm going
to do is just think about whether or not
each of the factors here we have three
of them is positive or negative and then
of course I also need to take into
account the negative sign that's on the
outside so I'll write that one first we
have a negative sign on the outside put
plug in negative Levin here negative 11
plus 10 is a negative number so we have
negative and negative in the numerator
and then ends in denominator we have
negative number for this factor and a
negative number for this factor for
negatives multiplied or divided it
together gives us a positive number so
this region works now let's do the same
thing for negative 5 in going through
the same sorts of steps for the next
three it turns out that only this region
the first one we found and the area
between negative 2 and 2 yield positive
solutions let's check the three critical
values this way also notice that when we
plug in negative 10 we end up with zero
for the numerator that means that this
entire fraction can never be greater
than zero so negative 10 is not part of
our solution set negative 2 and positive
2 each make the expressional left hand
side contain a division by zero so these
cannot be part of our solution set
either great so we have these two
intervals to take into account we have
the interval negative infinity to
negative and 10 united with the interval
negative 2 22 awesome that's our
solution great job with some really
tough work on quadratic inequalities and
rational inequalities I know there are a
lot of steps and all these problems but
I hope you developed a little bit of
Independence in figuring out how to
solve these kinds of inequalities
they're pretty cool too going to do one
more quick thing and show you
graphically what this inequality might
look like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
