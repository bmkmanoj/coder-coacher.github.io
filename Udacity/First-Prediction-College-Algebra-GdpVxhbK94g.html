using real data and then trying to fit
equations to it is that it doesn't
usually fit a single function perfectly
we can find curves that approximate it
but it's probably not going to be a
completely one hundred percent perfect
fit so let's see how that fit changes
depending on which points here we decide
to base our function off of here for
example is the graph that we would get
if we use the first two points on our
chart to create an exponential graph so
what would this graph predict the
population to be in the year 2013
considering the scale on our graph here
it probably seems like it's pretty
tricky to predict that but luckily
desmos is here to help you'll find a
link to this exact graph in the
instructor comments on this question
click on the link and then this graph
will pop up once it does you can take
your mouse and then touch a point on the
curve from there you can drag it and
select what x value you want and from
there you can see what Y value
corresponds to it remember that this
graph measures the year on the x-axis
and it shows the world population in
billions of people on the y-axis now
once you figured out what this graph
says the population will be in 2013 can
you tell me if this is an accurate
prediction think about what the
population actually became 5 year 2013
and see if this is the same thing if you
want to you can also use google to
search for world population in 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
