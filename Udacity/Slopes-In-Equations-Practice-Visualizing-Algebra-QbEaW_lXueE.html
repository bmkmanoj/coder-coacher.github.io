you did great job for the first equation
we have y equals 3x plus 9 this equation
is in slope-intercept form for slope
intercept form we know the equation is y
equals MX plus B where B is the
y-intercept and m is the slope so we
know if the equation is in
slope-intercept form the coefficient to
the x variable is going to be the slope
so in this case the slope is equal to 3
the second equation is written in
standard form 3x plus 2y equals 7 I find
putting the equation in slope-intercept
form the easiest way to find the slope
of an equation that is in standard form
it just takes two simple steps the first
step is to subtract 3x from both sides
when i subtract 3x from both sides i get
2y equals negative 3x plus 7 i'm almost
in slope-intercept form but i have to
why instead of y equals so i have to
divide everything through by 2 when i
divide everything through by 2 i get y
equals negative 3 over 2 is negative 3
halves x plus 7 halves so once again
this equation is in slope-intercept form
so we know the coefficient of the x
variable which is negative 3 halves is
the slope so the slope is negative 3
halves the third practice problem was
just a little bit trickier to get this
equation in slope-intercept form i
subtract 6 x from both sides and again
negative 3y is equal to negative 6x plus
12 now here's where I have to be careful
I have to divide the whole equation
through by negative 3 this can be a
little confusing but let's just take it
one step at a time on the left side of
the equation i have negative 3 over
negative 3 which of course is 1 so that
just leaves me with why when i divide
negative 6x by negative 3 negative 6
divided by negative 3 is 2x and then I
have 12 divided by negative 3 12 divided
by negative 3 is negative 4 so now we
have the equation in slope-intercept
form and the slope is going to be the
coefficient of the x variable which is
too
if you got these answers correct great
job if not you might want to go back and
review the videos on how to find slope
from the equation of a line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
