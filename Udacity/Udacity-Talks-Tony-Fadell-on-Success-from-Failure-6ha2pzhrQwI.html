just have to know where to look for it
and that means that's a learning moment
so you say Evie Vega is success in
learning if you know how to learn
exactly you just have to look for it
because then you use that again and you
make sure you don't make that mistake
again or don't allow that mistake to
have it so your goal is to then just
because it didn't work out the way you
wanted to take that knowledge take those
learnings and reapply it to a new you
know a new direction and therefore
you're going to get better no one's you
know you've had I've had failure and it
takes years of building up that kind of
thick skin around you but that's what it
means to be resilient you just get up
and you keep going and you can and I
can't tell you there's been times when I
just SAT there though it's like oh the
world's gonna be over and then you know
what you just look at it and you think
about it and you have to project
yourself not today but to project
yourself into the future what could I do
in the future if you keep looking ahead
everybody fails you're not the only one
everybody does just get over it keep
going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
