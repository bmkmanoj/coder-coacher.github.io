through wait 0 is going to keep going up
after each of these updates and in fact
if you just you know plunk it through
it's not not particularly complicated
that after these first six updates at
this point wait 0 is about ten point
four and now we're going to finally do
this this last update of state seven
going back to itself hmm so let's let's
work through that update here okay well
that should be pretty easy we just do
what we did before we substitute in
everything okay so let's see alpha still
point one it are still 0 gamma is still
point nine yep the value of seven is
seven x 10.4 plus i guess still one yet
which is a 2.8 so 73.8 take at minus the
value of s where we just came from which
we just said was 73.8 yeah so we're
making a transition from state 7 back to
state 7 and so the value of s and the
value of s prime are the same right and
and then the it's just a feature which
is which is 77 and that's equal to some
kind of math thing oh that's not that
hard it's a minus point seven three
eight times seven negative 5.1 66 you
say so all right so that's kind of good
news right because this weight 0 which
had been getting you know pumped up and
up and up and up is going to come back
down a bit and in fact now balls that's
not good because w0 went up a lot more
than you're about to take it back down
well sure yeah so wait 0 after all these
updates have happened the weight is five
point two three four it started off at
one recall and now has actually blown up
quite substantially so this this last
update does help but it doesn't help
enough is that what is that what you're
getting at yeah and in fact that's going
to keep happening because it didn't
matter that we started at one in
potatoes nothing magical about one the
point is it's going to keep getting
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
and that's actually true for w1 w2 w3
w-4 w5w 6 and w7 right so if we we
finish this sequence of updates and we
go and do it again this weight zero is
going to get
up even more weights one through six are
also going to get pumped up wait seven
is going down but not enough to make up
for the rest of everybody so yeah so
this is it's this is bad right so we
just keep doing these updates over and
over again and we'd want them to
converge we want them to kind of get to
the right numbers and instead we're just
spiraling out of control they're going
to converge to infinity I think that's
kind of the definition of not converging
well it's one kind of not converging
right it's diverging well that's
depressing yeah so even in this this
what would otherwise be very well
behaved example doing what is clearly
the right thing in terms of doing these
these weight updates actually is not the
right thing so yeah so bad things happen
so I think I can convince myself just by
staring at it that if we happen to set
all the weights to start off as zero
they won't ever move and the right thing
will happen should we check that sure
let's give it a quick check</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
