sensitivity and see how it is calculated
in the language of hypothesis testing we
can have the classification problem
expressed as a hypothesis 1 or class 1
and hypotheses to as class too often one
of the hypothesis is called the null
hypothesis and the other the alternate
hypothesis in our example we can say
hypothesis 1 as the person is B and
hypothesis to as the person is f this is
the case of a binary classifier now
recall we had two kinds of errors
defined the type 1 error and the type 2
error the type 2 error is the 1 minus
the specificity the model inherently
classifies between the two classes or
hypothesis by making a cut or a
threshold in this case let's put the
threshold as 0.5 with this cut we can
calculate the area under the probability
distribution of both the hypothesis if
the type 1 error for a given cut or test
statistic for a given hypothesis is less
than a predetermined value called
significance which is expressed as a
probability of the classifier we fail to
reject that class we also claim that as
failing to reject the null hypothesis we
also define the power of the test as 1
minus the sensitivity of the type 2
error now notice the sensitivity and the
specificity is dependent on the
threshold or the cut determined here if
we move this around the values for
sensitivity and specificity will change
you can guess now that we can draw a
curve that plots the specificity versus
sensitivity for different values of this
cut such a curve is called a receiver
operator characteristic curve in the
following
video we will look at an ROC curve for
our classifiers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
