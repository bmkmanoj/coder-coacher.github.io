requires you to think a bit outside the
box of what I normally ask we can
implement optimization okay so that it
returns a safe answer for optimization
in all cases will remember how are we
using optimization okay we consider a
bunch of optimizations and if this says
true then we swap out parts of the
program so a safe answer is just to
return false all the time never do any
optimizations that will make for slower
programs but it's safe because we'll
always get the same answer whenever
changing the meaning of the program
optimization is sometimes described as
conservative because if you're not
absolutely certain that an optimization
is okay just be conservative and don't
do it and you'll be fine the program
will be a little slower it'll always get
the right answer we cannot implement an
optimization ok that works precisely in
all cases it is undecidable like the
halting problem this sadly is true I'm
going to sketch an answer for this a
formal proof that something is
impossible like the halting problem so
little beyond the scope of most of this
class but let me show you how it would
go suppose we could write optimization
ok in a way that was precisely correct
in all cases I the great west zeny shall
solve the halting problem by telling you
if an arbitrary program halts or not you
want to know if a program P halts or not
I'm going to tell you how to do it
remember we know this is impossible
here's how we do it suppose you claim
we've implemented optimization ok it
always gets exactly the right answer I'm
going to use it to build a halting
problem solver you give me a program P
and you want to know if it halts I just
make up a little program over here
called loops forever or loops this
procedure loops sets x 20 and while true
at increment sex we've seen before that
this program never terminates never
returns a value I can just check to see
if your program ever halts by checking
to see if it would be okay to replace it
with loops forever if your program gets
this same answer on all inputs as loops
forever then your program loops forever
on all inputs otherwise your program
halts if optimization ok could be
written then the halting problem could
be written this halting problem decider
this cannot be we've seen before that
there's no way to solve the halting
problem it's equivalent to figuring out
if this sentence is false is true or
false it's a contradiction in the real
world so halts is impossible but I could
totally make halts if I had optimization
okay that means optimization okay must
be impossible impossible to solve every
time precisely we can solve it some of
the time we just can't solve it all of
the time because if we could solve it
all of the time it'd be just like the
halting problem then finally down here
at the end optimization okay of a B
implies optimization okay of BA this is
true because we're just checking
equality if a equals B then B equals a
now the 2 i've picked George F will a
Pulitzer prize-winning conservative
commentator and betty Friedan who wrote
The Feminine Mystique and led second
wave feminism in the United States
they're unlikely to have exactly the
same things to say these two are
unlikely to be equal but if they were
then you could reverse it and they would
match up you never know check them both
