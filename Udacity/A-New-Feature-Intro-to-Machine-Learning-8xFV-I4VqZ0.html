that will change your answer from no to
yes and that trick relates to features
so far we assumed that we input our data
features X and Y into this magic black
box called support vector machine in
outcomes a label where labels either a
blue circle or a red X so I'm going to
pick a feature that is helpful for my
example here it's going to be X square
plus y square by that you'll see in a
minute but I can convince you that is
easy to compute X square plus y square
from X&amp;amp;Y so now I have a
three-dimensional input space which is
hard to draw over here and I can run the
exact same algorithm on these three
features that I previously went on the
two features and here's my hundred
thousand dollar question to support that
the machines work right now up or
differently is this new situation
linearly separable by which I mean can
we find the line or a hyperplane that
separates the axis from the circles if
this is now a new feature space it's
going to be a trick question it's a
hundred thousand dollar questions which
means if you get it right I won't give
you hundred thousand dollars but give it
a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
