time of this algorithm here is 2 n plus
a plus 1 so even for this simple
algorithm the running time depends on
both the size of the inputs or the
length of the string and the structure
of the input which in this case is the
number of times the letter a occurs and
this is of course very problematic
because on the one hand when we get more
complicated algorithms the formula here
will get very very complicated and the
second thing is that most of the time we
don't even know what kinds of strings
the algorithm will encounter so we
cannot get rid of this variable without
making any assumptions so we want to
avoid these complications and there's
actually three different ways you could
do that the first one would be to have a
very optimistic view and state the
running time for the best possible input
that this algorithm could receive so
basically saying this is the minimum
running time of the algorithm and stayed
that as its overall running time you
could of course also take the opposite
view and say we're going to state the
running time as a worst-case view so
we're going to be very pessimistic
almost like there was an adversary who
was giving us the worst possible inputs
and then stayed that as the running time
and then finally we can take an
in-between view and say well the usual
input for the algorithm is not going to
be a best case it's also not going to be
worst case so let's state some kind of
average</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
