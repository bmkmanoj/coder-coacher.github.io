completely trust coleen coleen knows
that I'm giving a message to her and she
can open that message and know that it
goes to Alice it doesn't require the
first one if Bob sees me talking with
Colleen presumably that's not a problem
it doesn't require the second if Bob see
is Colleen talking with Alice that's
also not a problem if Bob sees both of
those and sees them in quick succession
especially if he sees the envelopes
being handed on well then he's got a
good reason to suspect that i'm talking
with Alice so we need both of these
properties we need to know that Colleen
can be trusted and we need to know that
Bob can't see both of these transactions
those are pretty high security
assumptions we don't want to have to
trust Colleen completely and we don't
want to rely on the fact that Bob can't
see these two conversations so the way
to make it more secure is to add a third
person let's say we know Edgar as well
and now instead of giving the message
directly to Colleen what I'm going to do
is take the envelope for Colleen put
that inside an envelope for Edgar we
need to fold things a little to make
them fit and now I'm going to seal this
envelope with a very secure seal that
only Edgar can open so now I'll give
this envelope to Edgar Edgar will open
it see that it has a message for Colleen
Edgar will give the message to coleen
coleen will open that see that it has a
message for Alice give the message to
Alice and Alice will open the message
and see that she shouldn't eat the onion
this has more protection now Colleen
doesn't know that I'm communicating with
Alice because the message is going like
this it's going first to Edgar then the
Colleen then Dallas so neither Edgar nor
Colleen knows that I'm communicating
with Alice Edgar knows that I'm sending
a message through him that goes to
coleen coleen knows that she is
receiving a message from Edgar and is
going to Alice neither one knows both
endpoints if we add enough hops this can
start to be quite secure and this is
actually called Onion Routing that's why
the message is 290
onion and the name comes from the idea
that onion has all these layers and as
you peel off the layers you get deeper
into the onion so doing this with
envelopes would be pretty painful we
want to do this with math so how do we
do this with cryptography</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
