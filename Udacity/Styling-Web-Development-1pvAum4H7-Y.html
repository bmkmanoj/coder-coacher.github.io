this case you could probably guess what
it's going to be title Batman let's
paste them in here and when I click
Submit we see our Batman pretty neat huh
now we have this nice art channel so
this is our HTML you know I've been
including these classes and I keep
referring to oh you know these are good
for styling things and this air is good
for styling things let me go I'm gonna
go ahead and show you a few Styles here
that just makes this app a little bit
better so you can add a style tag this
has type text/css now we are not going
to quiz you at all on this and in a lot
of our homeworks and stuff going forward
I'll provide the styles but I'm gonna
I'm gonna pop in a few here that I wrote
okay I just pasted it in a bunch of
styles and and I'll just walk you
through them real quick because it's
fairly easy to read basically the syntax
is body so this means our body tag it's
going to have a font family sans-serif
so we'll get rid of the seraphs it's
going to be with 800 pixels this is a
trick for centering it and giving some
padding our error style that we added
for error message that's going to have
red text our label instead of being
display inline I'm going to make it
display:block which is going to cause it
to use its own line and I'm going to
make the font bigger our input for our
title I'm going to make that wider with
400 I'm going to make the font size
bigger I'm going to add some padding
that padding is kind of spaced between
the outside of the element and the
contents I'm gonna make our text area
wider and taller and give it a bigger
font and also make it a mono spaced font
which is good for ASCII art I'm going to
make the text of our submit button
bigger I'm going to add some margins
between these elements that rhr our rule
is going to have 20 pixels on either
side our artwork is going to have 20
pixels between each of them and our art
titles are going to be bold and they're
gonna be 20 pixels tall the font and our
art body is not going to have any margin
on it and it's font size is gonna be 17
pixels so I know that was a lot you
don't have to know this or really even
understand it I just want you to know
what it does or what it is and let's go
to our browser and see how this looks so
here's our old old page I'm going to
reload this with our new style
oh yeah look at that now I've got this
big form nicer fonts and a big big much
nicer Batman and a much nicer camel you
know just a few little styles can go a
long way to making a to making a web app
look a little you know a lot nicer
actually okay so I hope you enjoyed that
I hope you learned something that's the
end of this units your next homework is
gonna be basically using these skills I
just demonstrated so I hope you have fun
with that thanks for thanks for
