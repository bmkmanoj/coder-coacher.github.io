visualizations that you see on Pali yeah
I think it's just kind of like the most
often used ones because they're so
familiar and also because you know they
are kind of the classics are we see a
lot of line charts bar charts and
scatter charts then a lot of histograms
but it also depends a lot on the user
like certain users will only make bubble
charts or only make you know heat maps
so if you scroll through our feed you
can see a lot of different types of
graphs but those are the the most often
made types and are there any
unconventional chart types that you see
yeah so one fun thing about plotly is
you can kind of invent your own chart
types if you'd like to we've tried to
make it a really flexible environment
for being able to use different
languages or different programs to be
able to draw your graphs so we don't
natively support maps for example but
people have made maps using different
packages from Python or our people have
made network visualizations which we
don't natively support but someone has
made a couple of those using a language
called julia and then we've also seen
people make sort of just their own
out-of-the-box data visualizations that
mimic some type of event that they'd
like to show a visualization of that
doesn't even necessarily have a name as
a graph type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
