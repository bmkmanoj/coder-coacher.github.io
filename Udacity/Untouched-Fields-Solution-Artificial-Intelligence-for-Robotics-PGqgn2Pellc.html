following missing links this guy here
gives me some to values in the matrix
this guy here another two and this link
he is also missing so it's another two
so six values missing let's prove it to
ourselves moving from X 0 to X 1 fills
out this area from X 1 to X 2 this area
so seeing n mark L 0 from X 0 and X 1
means you fill these guys over here
and the main diagonal there and seeing
the other end mark from X 1 and X 2
means we fill these guys over here let's
count the ones that are still open any
other ones and my answer was actually
wrong it's 8 I overlooked there's no
direct link from l1 to l2 eda so my
apologies that I gave you the wrong
number but it proves to you this is
actually not an easy question it's
harder than I thought and the reason is
there's also no direct link that
constraints l1 and l2 directly landmarks
can't see so they can't put a direct
link between any two landmarks or put
differently in this part over here our
matrix will always be a diagonal matrix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
