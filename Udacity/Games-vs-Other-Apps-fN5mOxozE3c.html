types of apps it's a hard question
because there are so many different
types of games but here are a few of the
things that make writing games different
from writing other types of apps the
first thing is that games are often
built around an update loop or a game
loop this is as opposed to an event
based application where the application
basically sits around not doing much of
anything until the user provides some
input games on the other hand are built
around a timer the fire 60 times a
second when that timer fires it means
it's time for the game to go look at the
user input update the state of the game
world and then draw a new frame to the
screen this means games often need to
deal with polling freezer input next
games often involve a ton of custom
drawing well you can make an Android app
using entirely off the shelf user
interface components it's rare that you
can do so with the game you'll have to
create your UI and your game world using
either primitive shapes like lines
rectangles and circles or your own
custom image assets from pixel art all
the way up to complex characters many
games also feature special effects and
animations which are a ton of fun to
make but also a lot of hard work there
are whole fields of study that are much
more relevant to gains than other types
of apps like physics and AI there's also
exotic input devices to deal with like
game pad controllers or more
interestingly for this class
accelerometers like the one you've
gotten your phone finally my favorite
part of game development is the fact
that you get to create a lot of objects
that have visible representations in
your game world designing an elegant
object-oriented app is a lot more fun
when your objects can run around hitting
each other with swords</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
