slightly more friends than men since I
can see that this median line is
slightly higher that's what this black
line is it represents the median are
that middle 50% of friend counts for
females and for males now this
difference isn't very large so let's
zoom in to take a closer look this box
for females and this box for males
represents the middle 50% of values in
our sample so I think it makes sense
that we zoom in even more to take a
closer look we should consider any
values less than 250 now there's no
exact choice here I'm just choosing
something that seems reasonable since
the bulk of my data is down here after
running this code we can now see that
the bulk of user friend count is similar
for the middle 50% of men as it is for
the middle 50% of women it's just their
females are slightly higher for friend
count let's look at actual values though
and compare the values to what we see in
our box plot we can look at those values
by using the by command and running a
summary over friend count split by
gender so first I want to include the
friend count which is the variable I
want a summary of I want to split it
over gender and I want a summary running
this code I get an output of my table
which shows me the minimum maximum
values for both genders as well as the
quartiles the first quartile for women
is 37 and that looks about right in our
graph the third quartile or the 75% mark
is at 244 and that's all the way up here
this means that 75% of female users have
friend counts below 244 or another way
to say this is that 25% of female users
have more than 244 friends similarly for
the men we can see how the first
quartiles and the third quartiles match
up to the box plot now you might have
remembered that we use coord Cartesian
in the solution video from before we did
this so that way the table output would
match our box plots if we would have
just used the Weiland parameter inside
of queue plot we would have gotten
different quantiles that wouldn't match
our picture this is just a subtle
difference that you should be aware of
when working in are now it's your turn
to answer a different question on
average who initiated more friendships
in our sample was it men or was it women
use some of the techniques that we just
covered and then write a few sentences
explaining how you came up with your
answer the second question won't be
automatically graded but it's important
that you know how to communicate
your analysis to other people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
