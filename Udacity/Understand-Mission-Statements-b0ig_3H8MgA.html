you write one for your startup let's
define what a mission statement is what
questions that should answer and then go
over some guidelines you can use to
write one for your business so first
what is it a mission statement is a
statement of your company's functions
market and goals the purpose of your
mission statement is to ground your big
dream in terms of the steps you plan to
take to reach it you'll focus on what
you're capable of right now and what you
can achieve in the near future there's a
few basic questions that a mission
statement should be able to answer what
do you do who do you do it for and how
do you do it your mission statement
should take division you've created and
define what you plan to do to achieve it
so how long should your mission
statement be this is similar to a vision
statement and that there's no set length
that it needs to be some mission
statements can be a single sentence and
some can be a full paragraph just make
sure you're providing the clarity needed
to give direction to you and your team
focus on the actual value that you
provide to your users for example
Google's vision is to provide access to
the world's information in one click but
their mission statement is a little more
specific googles mission is to organize
the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful do you
see how their mission statement
describes the way in which they plan to
achieve their vision they organize
information and make it accessible try
to provide a similar clarity for your
mission statement so now that you know a
little more about the purpose of a
mission statement take some time to come
up with one that you could use for your
company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
