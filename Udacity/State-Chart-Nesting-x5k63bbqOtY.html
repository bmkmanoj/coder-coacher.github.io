Elle's original paper in there he has
several abstract diagrams laying out the
various features of the state chart
notation on the left there's a state
machine that has three states notice the
default state is the top one and with
the line coming into it and there are
transitions among the states
totally there are six transitions there
the version on the right labeled B okay
is a nested state transition diagram a
new state called D in the round tangle
surrounds states a and B a is still the
default state for the the state machine
as a whole but notice that some of the
lines come out of D rather than coming
out of either a or C going back to the
one on the left notice there are two
transitions labeled F when coming out
from a and going to be when coming out
of seeing going to be on the right
they're coming out of D that is there's
a there's a an abstraction saying when
you leave any state in D under
transition F you go to B so in that case
we've reduced to transitions labeled F
to one there's still the transition from
A to C there's still the transition from
B to a notice also though that there's a
transition from B to D labeled H in this
case where does it go well notice that
we've added a new default state and it's
transition for C that is if a transition
comes into D to the border of D where is
it going to go it's going to go to the
default state which is C well this is
identical to what's happening on the
left or there's a direct line from B to
C in this case the lines a little
shorter saving just a little bit of
complexity we could also have the
nesting go further that is a or C or B
could themselves have sub state machines
