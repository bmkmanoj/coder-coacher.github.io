not really feasible because your nails
grow independent of how long your hand
is we also can't assert this second one
we can't simply say that taller people
have longer hands in fact if we look at
the data these two people look like they
have about the same height but they have
very different hand lengths therefore we
can't say with certainty that taller
people automatically have longer hands
there's just a trend in that direction
also if we look at this trend we see
that people who have about my hand
length which is 6.75 tend to have
heights around this area 7 feet is 84
inches which is way up here therefore
it's very unlikely that I'm taller than
7 feet but I could be remember this
relationship shows a correlation not a
causation therefore we can't draw this
conclusion however we can say with
certainty that people who have longer
hands tend to be taller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
