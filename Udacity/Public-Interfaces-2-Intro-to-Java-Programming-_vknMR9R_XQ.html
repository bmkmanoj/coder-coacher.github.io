such as the picture class here or have
an owner's manual here is how you can
find it select the Tools menu project
documentation and a browser window will
pop up here it is as you can see we have
the documentation of the picture class
as you scroll through it you will find a
method summary for example here's the
Gros method and you can see it says
resizes this picture of both
horizontally and vertically when you
click on the link a detailed explanation
pops up and here it explains that you
need to feed two numbers that are called
here TW entity H and they're further
described down here the first number is
the amount by which to resize the width
on each side and the other the amount by
which to resize the height on each side
that's how it works for the classes that
we give you if you use a standard
library class such as the string class
you instead want to look at the official
documentation I've made a bookmark for
it and I suggest you do the same here it
is on the left you have a listing of all
of the various classes there many of
them most of which you never need to
know let's find the string class here it
is click on it on the right the
documentation for the string class is
displayed and again you can scroll
through it you will find a summary of
all of the methods there are many
methods most of which you don't need to
know and when there's one that interests
you you can click on it and get a
detailed explanation you will have lots
of practice with that during this lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
