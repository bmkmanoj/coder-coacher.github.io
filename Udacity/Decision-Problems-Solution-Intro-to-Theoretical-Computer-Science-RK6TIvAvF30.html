optimization version to be tractable
then the decision version is also
tractable and if we know it to be
intractable then the decision version is
also intractable and the same goes if we
have the information about the decision
version so you see the tractability of
an optimization version and of a
decision version are closely related now
two of these answers I think are more
obvious than two other ones I think the
answer to question one is rather obvious
because if the optimization version is
tractable so you can find the best
possible solution in polynomial time
then with that solution you can also
very easily answer a yes or no question
about the solution the same thing is
true I think for answer number four
because if the decision version is
intractable then the optimization
version also has to be intractable or if
you could easily solve the optimization
version then it would also be easy to
answer a yes or no question about the
solution the answers to question number
two and number three I think are a
little bit less obvious so if you know
the optimization version to be
intractable then of course it could be
the case that just having to say yes or
no given the size of the solution that
you're looking for could be easier that
could be tractable so you would have to
show in some way that if the decision
version were tractable then the
optimization version would also be easy
to solve which is basically what I've
asked you to think about in question
number three here one way to show this
is and this is not very precise but just
to give you an idea here that if you
have a a tractable decision version then
you could ask multiple questions about
the solution and still remain in
polynomial time so for example if you're
looking for the best possible solution
for vertex cover you could first ask the
decision version say for in half as the
value K you're looking for and see if
you can find a solution of this size if
that is the case you can decrease K or
if you cannot find a solution that is
that small then you have to increase K
and by solving the decision version
often enough so searching for that
optimum K you can also solve the
optimization version so this is not that
obvious to see but for now you can keep
in mind that
optimization versions of a problem and
decision versions of a problem behave
more or less the same with respect to
tractability or intractability</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
