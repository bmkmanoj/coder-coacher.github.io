mathematical morphology that is fixing
up your picture okay and fundamentally
there are two basic operations and
they're referred to as dilation and
erosion we're going to go through both
of those in detail once you have those
two basic operations you can combine
those to make more operations there are
a whole bunch of them and this used to
be a whole industry doing mathematical
morphology the ones that we use most to
date or I should say the ones that we
use most currently are various forms of
closing and opening and we're gonna talk
about those then there's thinning and
thickening and few other things but they
all stem from these two basic operations
of dilation and erosion so let's go
through those so dilation is exactly
what it sounds like
right when you dilate something it
expands and so dilation expands the
connected set of ones in the binary
image so here you see this thing you
expand it to get bigger and really you
know just grew out and we're gonna talk
about the mechanisms by which you do
dilation and something called the
structuring elements which control the
shape this one is an interesting one
right everything expanded and has two
effects first of all things got a little
straighter but also notice that these
little cutouts went away
likewise when this thing got bigger okay
the holes went away dilation in general
can be used for like says filling holes
and gaps the inverse converse reverse
the other of dilation is called erosion
okay rosin just like when beaches and
other things a road is you're
essentially shrinking the shape right so
this big bar becomes a narrower bar this
big circle becomes a small circle here's
where you start to see its power right
these two connected sort of elliptical
things become here that's this case
these two circular things you could
actually do it go from this lips the
circle is important thing is that that
middle part went away and here you see
that these little two rinses went away
when the entire thing shrank and that's
referred to as erosion okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
